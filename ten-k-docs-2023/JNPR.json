Leveraging the Netrounds acquisition, we developed the Juniper Paragon Automation, a modular portfolio of cloud-native software applications that deliver closed-loop automation in the most demanding 5G and multicloud environments. In 2022, we announced our Cloud Metro vision, strategy, and portfolio, which is a new category of solutions for service providers optimized for metro transformation and sustainable business growth. Juniper&#8217;s Cloud Metro solution includes high-performance networking systems, powered by AI-enabled, cloud-delivered automation specifically designed to build next generation infrastructure. \n\nWe are committed to continued investment in cost-effective and high-performance IP transport platforms and automation software, which form the basis of these high-performance networks. \n\nAI-Driven Enterprise \n\nEnterprises are consuming more value-as-a-service, where value is delivered in the form of cloud-based software and services driven by AI. We have introduced cloud management and security products, enabling enterprises to securely consume cloud infrastructure and services. We believe the transition to AIOps and SaaS presents an opportunity for us to come to market with innovative network and security solutions for our Enterprise customers, which facilitate their transition to cloud architecture and operational experience. Our Mist AI uses a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science techniques to optimize user experiences and simplify operations across the wireless access, wired access, and SD-WAN domains. Machine learning technology simplifies wireless and wired operations and delivers a more agile cloud services platform. Also, our SSR portfolio acquired from 128 Technology extended the value of Mist&#8217;s secure AI-engine and cloud management capabilities from client to cloud. Session Smart is the third generation of Software Defined-Wide Area Network (&#8220;SD-WAN&#8221;), which delivers unique technology that materially reduces WAN overhead, minimizes network latency, and replaces outdated and cumbersome network policies with flexible and real-time actions that are tied to real business and user needs. Gartner recognized Juniper as a Visionary in the 2022 Magic Quadrant&#8482; SD-WAN category and a leader in the 2022 Magic Quadrant&#8482; for Indoor Location Services, Global. Also, Juniper was recognized as a Gartner Magic Quadrant&#8482; Leader for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure in 2022, for the third year in a row. \n\nWe believe our understanding of high-performance networking technology, cloud architecture, and our strategy, positions us to capitalize on the industry transition to more automated, cost-efficient, scalable networks. \n\nCustomer Verticals \n\nWe sell our high-performance network products and service offerings through direct sales; distributors; value-added resellers, or VARs; and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, to end-users in the following verticals: Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise. \n\nFurther, we believe our solutions benefit our customers by: \n\n&#8226; Reducing capital and operational costs by running multiple services over the same network using our secure, high-density, highly automated, and highly reliable platforms; \n\n&#8226; Creating new or additional revenue opportunities by enabling new services to be offered to new market segments, which includes existing customers and new customers, based on our product capabilities; \n\n&#8226; Increasing customer satisfaction, while lowering costs, by optimizing the experience of network operators and their users via automation, AI-enabled troubleshooting and support, and cloud management; \n\n&#8226; Providing increased asset longevity and higher return on investment as our customers' networks can scale to higher throughput based on the capabilities of our platforms; \n\n&#8226; Offering network security across every environment&#8212;from the data center to campus and branch environments to assist in the protection and recovery of services and applications; and \n\n&#8226; Offering operational improvements that enable cost reductions, including lower administrative, training, customer care, and labor costs. \n\nThe following is an overview of the trends affecting the market in which we operate by each of our customer verticals. We believe the networking needs for each of our customers will eventually result in cloud-based network architectures for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency. \n\nCloud \n\nOur Cloud vertical includes companies that are heavily reliant on the cloud for their business model&#8217;s success. Customers in the Cloud vertical can include cloud service providers, such as the largest public cloud providers, which we refer to as hyperscalers, and Tier-2 cloud providers, which we refer to as cloud majors, as well as enterprises that provide SaaS, infrastructure-as-a-service, or platform-as-a-service. \n\nCloud providers continue to grow as more organizations take advantage of public infrastructure to run their businesses. As their businesses grow, we expect they will continue to invest in their networks, which dictate the quality and experience of the products and the services they deliver to their end customers. Further, as cloud providers adopt new technologies, including the 400-gigabit Ethernet, or 400GbE, and in anticipation of the future adoption of 800-gigabit Ethernet, or 800GbE, and beyond, \n\nwe believe this should present further opportunities for us across our portfolio as our cloud customers value high-performance, highly compact, power-efficient infrastructures, which we support and continue to develop. \n\nIn addition, SaaS continues to be an important factor for cloud providers as their customers, such as enterprises, prefer to procure and consume product and service offerings via SaaS models. As a result, we believe that SaaS providers will invest in high-performance infrastructure because the quality of experience has proven just as important competitively as software features and functions. Lastly, as a result of regulations and the need for lower latency and high-performance networking, cloud providers have been transitioning to regional network build-outs or distributed cloud environments to address the increasing demand for services, data privacy, data protection, and consumer rights. \n\nAs Cloud customers are pushing the envelope in networking, our focus on collaboration combined with networking innovation around automation has made us a strategic partner with these customers, helping them develop high-performance and lower total cost of ownership networking solutions to support their business. \n\nService Provider \n\nOur Service Provider vertical includes wireline and wireless carriers and cable operators, and we support most of the major carrier and operator networks in the world with our high-performance network infrastructure offerings. In recent years, we have seen increased convergence of these different types of customers through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships. \n\nService Provider customers recognize the need for high-performance networks and leveraging the cloud to reduce costs from their network operations. This is dictating a change in business models and their underlying infrastructure, which we believe requires investment in the build-out of high-performance networks and the transformation of existing legacy infrastructure to distributed cloud environments in order to satisfy the growth in mobile traffic and video as a result of the increase in mobile device usage including smartphones, tablets, and connected devices of various kinds. \n\nWe expect that Network Function Virtualization and SDN will be critical elements to enable our Service Provider customers the flexibility to support enhanced mobile video and dynamic new service deployments. We are engaging with these customers to transition their operations to next-generation cloud operations as the need for a highly efficient infrastructure to handle large amounts of data along with low latency, or minimal delay, plays into the need to have a high performance, scalable infrastructure in combination with the automation and flexibility required to drive down operational costs and rapid provision applications. We consistently deliver leading technologies that transform the economics and experience of networking while significantly improving customer economics by lowering the capital expenditures required to build networks and the operating expenses required to manage and maintain them. \n\nIn addition to reducing operating costs, service providers are seeking to create new or additional revenue opportunities to support their evolving business models. These customers are deploying 5G, which we expect will continue to roll out over the next few years, and IoT, which we believe will give rise to new services like connected cars, smart cities, robotic manufacturing, and agricultural transformation. 5G and IoT require a highly distributed cloud data center architecture from which services are delivered to the end users and will involve a great degree of analytics and embedded security. We expect this trend will present further opportunities for Juniper with our focus on delivering a strong portfolio of network virtualization and software-based orchestration solutions, which position us to deliver on the automation and agility requirements of service providers. \n\nEnterprise \n\nOur high-performance network infrastructure offerings are designed to meet the performance, reliability, and security requirements of the world's most demanding enterprises. We offer enterprise solutions and services for data centers as well as branch and campus applications. Our Enterprise vertical includes enterprises not included in the Cloud vertical. They are industries with high performance, high agility requirements, including retail companies, healthcare institutions, financial services; national, federal, state, and local governments; as well as research and educational institutions. We believe that our Enterprise customers are able to deploy our solutions as a powerful component in delivering the advanced network capabilities needed for their leading-edge applications. \n\nBusinesses are adopting cloud-based applications and services to avoid infrastructure cost and complexity, increase IT agility, and accelerate digital transformation. We believe that as our Enterprise customers continue to transition their workloads to the cloud, they continue to seek greater flexibility in how they consume networking and security services, such as pay-per-use models. Additionally, Enterprises are deploying AI-driven architectures, which require end-to-end solutions for managing, \n\norchestrating, and securing distributed cloud resources as a single pool of resources. Also, we are increasingly seeing a convergence of networking and security, such as Secure Access Service Edge (\"SASE\"), resulting in security becoming an embedded capability in every solution that we offer to our customers. \n\nHigh-performance enterprises require IP networks that are global, distributed, and always available. We are innovating in key technology areas to meet the needs of our Enterprise customers whether they plan to move to a public cloud architecture or hybrid cloud architecture (which is a mix of public and private cloud, as well as a growing number of SaaS applications). \n\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nProducts, Services, and Technology \n\nEarly in our history, we developed, marketed, and sold the first commercially available purpose-built IP backbone router optimized for the specific high-performance requirements of telecom and cable operators. As the need for core bandwidth continued to increase, the need for service-rich platforms at the edge of the network was created. \n\nWe have systematically focused on how we innovate in silicon, systems, and software (including our Junos OS and virtual network functions, or VNF) such as firewall, network orchestration, and automation to provide a range of hardware and software solutions in high-performance, secure networking. \n\nFurther, our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product and services portfolios that simplify the operation of networks, and provide flexibility in consumption and deployment to our customers across our key verticals. Our software offerings include subscriptions, SaaS, and term or time-based perpetual licenses. We believe our software and related services revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software solutions designed to better monetize the value of software functionality in our offerings. \n\nSignificant Product Development Projects and Solutions \n\nIn 2022, we continued to execute on our product and service solution strategy and announced several new innovations, including new AI-driven switches and enhanced AIOps capabilities for simpler wired and wireless deployments and optimized client-to-cloud user experiences. In addition, we announced two new 6 GHz access points that leverage Mist AI to maximize Wi-Fi performance and capacity and a new IoT Assurance service that streamlines and scales the onboarding and securing of IoT devices without NAC. \n\nWe also announced our Cloud Metro vision, strategy, and portfolio, which is a new category of solutions for service providers optimized for metro transformation and sustainable business growth. Juniper&#8217;s Cloud Metro solution includes high-performance networking systems, powered by AI-enabled, cloud-delivered automation specifically designed to build next generation infrastructure. New solutions include Paragon Automation as a Service, AI-Enabled Device Onboarding-as-a-Service, ACX7000 Family, Juniper Paragon Active Assurance, Zero Trust Security, and Juniper Networks 400G ZR/ZR+ optics. \n\nFurther, we announced our continuing investment in the SASE market with the introduction of Juniper Secure Edge, a cloud-delivered Security Service Edge (\"SSE\") service that enables users to work from anywhere securely and performantly. Juniper Secure Edge gives customers the ability to deliver a unified and consistent user experience for their mobile or remote workforce as they transition from on premises locations to remote locations. We also announced the expansion of our SASE offering with the addition of Cloud Access Security Broker (\"CASB\") and advanced Data Loss Prevention (\"DLP\") capabilities to the Juniper Secure Edge solution. When combined with Juniper's unique SD-WAN solution driven by Mist AI, Juniper is one of the first in the market to offer a full-stack SASE solution with visibility into both the edge and the data center. \n\nMoreover, we announced a collaboration with Rakuten Symphony where Juniper RIC will be embedded as the exclusive RIC in Rakuten Symworld&#8482; marketplace. Juniper&#8217;s open and interoperable RIC platform brings new levels of service agility, automation, and operational efficiency to mobile networks by enabling a strong ecosystem of applications on top of the platform. \n\nThe following is an overview of our principal product families and service offerings in 2022: \n\nRouting Products \n\n&#8226; ACX Series : Our ACX Series Universal Access Routers cost-effectively address current operator challenges to rapidly deploy new high-bandwidth services.

Further, most of our distributors sell our competitors' products and services, and some sell their own competing products and services. \n\n&#8226; VARs and direct value-added resellers, including our strategic worldwide alliance partners referenced below, resell our products to end-users around the world. These channel partners either buy our products and services through distributors, or directly from us, and have expertise in designing, selling, implementing, and supporting complex networking solutions in their respective markets. Our agreements with these channel partners are generally non-exclusive, limited by region, and provide product and service discounts and other ordinary terms of sale. These agreements do not require these channel partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services. Increasingly, our cloud and service provider customers also resell our products or services to their customers or purchase our products or services for the purpose of providing managed or cloud-based services to their customers. \n\n&#8226; Strategic worldwide reseller relationships with established Juniper alliances, comprised of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation; Ericsson Telecom A.B.; International Business Machines, or IBM; NEC Corporation; Fujitsu Limited; and Atos SE. These companies each offer services and products that complement our own product and service offerings and act as a reseller, and in some instances as an integration partner for our products. Our arrangements with these partners allow them to resell our products and services on a non-exclusive and generally global basis, provide for product and service discounts, and specify other general terms of sale. These agreements do not require these partners to purchase specified quantities of our products or services. \n\nManufacturing and Operations \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed 372 people in supply chain operations who manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers, component suppliers, warehousing and logistics service providers. \n\nOur manufacturing is primarily conducted through contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in China, Malaysia, Mexico, and Taiwan. As of December 31, 2022, we utilized Celestica Incorporated, Flex Ltd., Accton Technology Corporation, Foxconn Technology Group and Alpha Networks Inc. for the majority of our manufacturing activity. Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers are responsible for all phases of manufacturing from prototypes to full production, including activities such as material procurement, surface mount assembly, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers, and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers, we design, specify, and monitor the tests that are required to ensure that our products meet internal and external quality standards. We believe that these arrangements provide us with the following benefits: \n\n&#8226; We can quickly ramp up and deliver products to customers with turnkey manufacturing; \n\n&#8226; We operate with a minimum amount of dedicated space and employees for manufacturing operations; and \n\n&#8226; We can reduce our costs by reducing what would normally be fixed overhead expenses. \n\nOur contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers build our products based on our rolling product demand forecasts. Our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components used in our products. Once the components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast are procured, our manufacturing partners assemble and test the products according to agreed-upon specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, resellers, or end-customers. To address supply-chain challenges, including increases in component and logistics costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and global component shortages, we are taking specific additional procurement actions, including strategic purchases of raw materials and components for the production of finished goods. As a result, we may incur additional holding costs and obsolescence charges, particularly resulting from uncertainties in future product demand. Title to the finished goods is generally transferred from the contract manufacturers to us when the products leave the contract manufacturer's or original design manufacturer's location. Customers take title to the products upon delivery at a specified destination. If the product or components remain unused or the products remain unsold for a specified period, we may incur carrying charges or charges for excess or obsolete materials. \n\nOur contracts with our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers set forth a framework within which the contract manufacturer and original design manufacturer, as applicable, may accept purchase orders from us. These contracts do not represent long-term commitments. \n\nSome of our custom components, such as ASICs and communication integrated circuits, are manufactured primarily by sole or limited sources, each of which is responsible for all aspects of production using our proprietary designs. To ensure the security and integrity of Juniper products during manufacture, assembly and distribution, we have implemented a supply chain risk management framework as part of our overall Brand Integrity Management System. This framework encompasses all aspects of the supply chain as well as enhanced elements specific to security issues applicable to Juniper products and our customers. \n\nBy working collaboratively with our suppliers and as members of coalitions such as the Responsible Business Alliance (\"RBA\"), Responsible Minerals Initiative, and the CDP Supply Chain program, we endeavor to promote socially and environmentally responsible business practices beyond our company and throughout our worldwide supply chain. To this end, we have adopted a business partner code of conduct and promote compliance with such code of conduct to our suppliers. Our business partner code of conduct expresses support for and is aligned with the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the RBA Code of Conduct. The RBA, a coalition of electronics, retail, auto and toy companies, provides guidelines and resources to drive performance and compliance with critical corporate social responsibility policies. Its goals are to promote ethical business practices, to ensure that working conditions in the electronic industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. By using standard audit and assessment protocols and tools, we measure and monitor manufacturing partners&#8217; top direct material suppliers&#8217;, and select indirect suppliers&#8217; compliance to the codes of conduct and applicable environmental, health and safety, labor and ethics legal requirements. This includes use of the RBA Code of Conduct risk assessments and onsite audits; CDP climate change and water requests; and conflict minerals surveys. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which details our supply chain efforts, and Business Partner Code of Conduct are available on our website. \n\nBacklog \n\nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders under master sales agreements either with our distributors, resellers, or end-customers. At any given time, we have a backlog of orders for products that have not shipped. Because certain orders are cancellable or delivery schedules may be changed, we believe that our backlog at any given date may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented industry-wide supply constraints, and the pandemic continues to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment. As a result, we have experienced a shortage of component parts and logistics timing issues since 2021, which has resulted in significantly higher levels of our product backlog. We expect these challenging supply chain conditions to modestly improve through the course of 2023. We anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels and to decline as supply improves. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our total product backlog was approximately $2,019 million and $1,833 million, respectively. Our product backlog consists of confirmed orders for products expected to be shipped to our distributors, resellers, or end-customers within the subsequent twelve months for 2021 and 2022, which extended period primarily reflects the ongoing impact of supply chain constraints. Backlog excludes certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals, sales return reserves, service revenue allocations, and early payment discounts. \n\nFor further discussion on the risks and uncertainties related to backlog, see the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Report. \n\nSeasonality \n\nWe, as do many companies in our industry, experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. Historically, we have experienced stronger customer demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net revenues or financial performance. The ongoing global component shortage and extended lead times and their impacts on our ability to ship products to our customers in a timely manner may disrupt our typical seasonal trends. \n\nCompetition \n\nWe compete in the network infrastructure markets. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to solutions that combine high performance networking with cloud technologies. In the network infrastructure business, Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, has historically been the dominant player. Our principal competitors also include Arista Networks, Inc.; Dell Technologies; Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., or HPE; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., or Huawei; Fortinet, Inc.; and Nokia Corporation, or Nokia. \n\nMany of our current and potential competitors, such as Cisco, Nokia, HPE, and Huawei, among others, have broader portfolios which enable them to bundle their networking products with other networking and information technology products in a manner \n\nthat may discourage customers from purchasing our products. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, marketing budgets, and more extensive customer bases that they may leverage to compete more effectively. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, negatively affecting our operating results. \n\nIn addition, there are a number of other competitors in the security network infrastructure space, including Cisco, Huawei, Nokia, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., Zscaler, Inc., Netskope, Inc., and Forcepoint LLC, among others, who tend to be focused specifically on security solutions and, therefore, may be considered specialized compared to our broader product line. \n\nWe expect that over time, large companies with significant resources, technical expertise, market experience, customer relationships, and broad product lines, such as Cisco, Nokia, and Huawei, will introduce new products designed to compete more effectively in the market. There are also several other companies that aim to build products with greater capabilities to compete with our products. Further, there has been significant consolidation in the networking industry, with smaller companies being acquired by larger, established suppliers of network infrastructure products. We believe this trend is likely to continue, which may increase the competitive pressure faced by us due to their increased size and breadth of their product portfolios. \n\nIn addition to established competitors, a number of public and private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same needs that our products address. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon our ability to demonstrate that our products are superior and cost effective in meeting the needs of our current and potential customers. \n\nAs a result, we expect to face increased competition in the future from larger companies with significantly more resources than we have and also from emerging companies that are developing new technologies. Although we believe that our technology and the purpose-built features of our products make them unique and will enable us to compete effectively with these companies, there can be no assurance that new products, enhancements, or business strategies will achieve widespread market acceptance. \n\nMaterial Government Regulations \n\nOur business activities are worldwide and subject us to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws in the countries in which we operate, and our products and services are subject to laws and regulations affecting the sale of our products. To date, costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations have not been material to our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future governmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products, or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that environmental and global trade regulations could potentially have a material impact on our business. \n\nEnvironment \n\nWe are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products, and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business and supply chain. Our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, such as the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive; Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment; Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals; and the U.S.'s Toxic Substances Control Act. \n\nJuniper&#8217;s greatest impact on the environment is through our products and services. We focus on circular economy principles, including designing products with sustainability in mind to make them more efficient, reliable, and long-lasting. We also select manufacturers, suppliers, and business partners who share our values and commitment to environmental sustainability. Our products are built for flexibility, interoperability, and scalability, which we believe contribute to long-term customer value. The modular design of our products allows for efficient servicing such as dismantling and repairing. The Juniper Certified Pre-Owned Program allows our customers to extend the life of their existing Juniper network. Our product design also encourages customers to recycle various parts at the end of the product life-cycle. We also consider other opportunities to minimize resource impacts and improve efficiencies over a product&#8217;s life cycle. For example, the Juniper Certified Pre-Owned program offers a broad range of refurbished high-performance network solutions from Juniper&#8217;s current line and end-of-production hardware portfolios with available Juniper-backed warranty and support services. This program helps reduce e-waste in landfills and reduces carbon emissions. \n\nWe also voluntarily participate in the annual CDP climate change and water security disclosures and encourage our manufacturing partners and select direct material suppliers to do the same. Additionally, we are a signatory supporter of the United Nations Global Compact and a member of the RBA, and have adopted and promote the adoption by our suppliers of the RBA Code of Conduct, as discussed above in the section entitled Manufacturing and Operations . We continue to invest in the infrastructure and systems required to execute on, monitor, and drive environmental improvements in our global operations and within our supply chain. \n\nGlobal Trade \n\nAs a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. The scope, nature, and severity of such controls varies widely across different countries and may change frequently over time. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or by requiring us to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. In particular, the U.S. and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of, among other things, certain telecommunications products and components, particularly those that contain or use encryption technology. Most of our products are telecommunications products and contain or use encryption technology and, consequently, are subject to restrictions. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that are expected to continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements. \n\nFor additional information concerning regulatory compliance and a discussion of the risks associated with governmental regulations that may materially impact us, see the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Report. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nOur success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and expertise, as well as our ability to obtain and protect necessary intellectual property rights. While we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark law, as well as confidentiality agreements, to protect our technology, we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. There can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. \n\nPatents \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had over 5,300 patents worldwide and numerous patent applications are pending. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued on the patent applications that we have filed, that we will be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that other parties will not contest our intellectual property rights. \n\nLicenses \n\nIn addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products and, from time to time, we need to renegotiate these licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models. There can be no assurance that third-party licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nTrademarks \n\nJUNIPER NETWORKS, JUNIPER, the Juniper Networks logo, JUNOS, RUNNING JUNOS, and other trademarks are registered trademarks of Juniper Networks, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the United States and other countries. Other names may be trademarks of their respective owners. \n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nWe believe our success in delivering high-performance networks in the digital transformation era relies on our culture, values, and the creativity and commitment of our people. As of December 31, 2022, we had 10,901 full-time employees, of whom approximately 44%, 43%, and 13% resided in the Americas, APAC, and EMEA, respectively. We invest in our people. We strive to maintain healthy, safe, and secure working conditions - a workplace where our employees are treated with respect and dignity. Our vision is to create an inclusive, diverse, and authentic community that inspires collaboration, integrity, engagement, and innovation. We are striving to create a world-class employee experience, one that offers opportunity for personal and professional growth, and enables work-life flexibility that aligns with the core values embodied in the Juniper Way. \n\nOur Values&#65306; The Juniper Way \n\nOur mission is to power connections and empower change &#8211; to be a responsible global citizen and influence meaningful differences in the world around us. We believe that powering connections will bring us closer together while empowering us all to solve some of the world&#8217;s greatest challenges of health and well-being, sustainability, and equity. \n\nTo deliver our mission to power connections and empower change, we rely on a committed and consistent practice that we call the Juniper Way. More than a set of shared values, the Juniper Way reflects the company&#8217;s commitment to inspire Juniper employees to do their best work. This foundation is embodied in three values &#8211; Be Bold, Build Trust, and Deliver Excellence - along with a set of refined behaviors for each. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nAs a company, we are committed to innovation and diversity of employees with many backgrounds, experiences, and identities. We believe that inclusion and diversity are competitive assets that drive positive change to our company and communities. At our core, we believe excellence depends on seeking out diverse ideas and fostering a culture where all employees belong. We aim to lead with vision and empathy, promoting understanding and awareness across our workforce, and we are committed to improving inclusivity by being engaged and accountable at the highest level of leadership. \n\nWe monitor our progress against our inclusion and diversity strategy of diversifying our talent base, creating an environment where all employees feel included and valued, and driving accountability across the organization. In 2022, we continued to make progress in our inclusion and diversity efforts. Our global Women's Sponsorship and Leadership Development Programs, which aim to empower the next generation of women leaders, continued in 2022, providing our female employees with opportunities for development, visibility, and growth. We also continued our global Inclusion and Diversity Ambassadors program to extend the reach of our inclusion and diversity efforts throughout Juniper, add new perspectives to the corporate team, and uplift the voices of employees. Finally, we launched our first Affinity Groups, employee-led groups that emphasize \n\nthe connection among employees from similar backgrounds and their allies, and which provide professional development, sense of belonging, and career connections. \n\nEmployee Engagement and Development \n\nWe use a framework called Talent Matters to encourage an open and interactive culture between employees and their managers, where individual needs are recognized and met, and company goals are supported. Our professional development approach includes reviewing and assessing our management teams as well as facilitating personal employee development and growth. For employees, growth goals are tied to our corporate objectives and key results to ensure that employees are progressing and are supported by management teams. In 2022, we continued our People Manager Network to provide global consistency in how managers lead teams and support employees, including a specific focus on leading during the COVID-19 pandemic and return to office. With this program, managers are empowered and provided with the training and resources to scale employee career growth and provide their teams with the necessary tools to facilitate that growth. Managers are encouraged to schedule Conversation Days with their direct reports to identify opportunities for the company to better support employees and set goals for professional and personal growth. \n\nTo ensure our employees&#8217; personal and professional growth, we continue to provide training courses focused on building personal capabilities as well as skill development. In response to employee feedback, we maintain LinkedIn Learning for all employees, offering online courses on business, technology, and creative skills. Additionally, each year, Juniper employees receive role-specific trainings, which include topics such as human rights, environmental performance, compliance with the Juniper Worldwide Code of Business Conduct, engineering, information security, and other compliance and industry-specific subjects. \n\nWe consistently work to improve the employee experience by addressing feedback collected through the annual Juniper Voice Survey and topic-specific surveys, including employee benefits and total rewards packages and Juniper's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nEmployee Retention, Benefits, and Wellness \n\nWe continue to prioritize our commitment to retaining and attracting a diverse workforce with the skills needed to deliver Experience-First Networking. We aim to provide benefits and programs that are holistic, flexible, and inclusive. We are committed to pay equity and benefits innovation. From offering childcare and working mother support, to expanding medical coverage for infertility and gender-affirming procedures, to foster and adoptive parent assistance, we have provided benefit offerings that are intended to be as inclusive and diverse as our employees&#8217; needs. \n\nOur community engagement program empowers employees to participate authentically, so they can make an impact where it matters most to them. We offer five paid working days per year for employees to give back to their communities and engage with causes of their choice. In 2022, we held our first Global Week of Giving, encouraging employees to volunteer with a project curated by Juniper or with an organization in their own communities. \n\nThe health, safety, and well-being of our employees are vital to Juniper's success. In 2022, we reopened our facilities world-wide for office-based employees in a new office/hybrid collaboration model. We are taking precautions to ensure employees have a smooth and safe transition, including training and resources to navigate the changes and communicating in-office COVID-19 protocols for our employees' health and safety. We continued to offer global programs to support our employees working remotely, including COVID-19 crisis leave, Employee Assistance Program, remote ergonomic support, and TaskHuman. Employees have unlimited access to the TaskHuman platform, a virtual wellness coaching application, which covers hundreds of wellness topics from yoga and nutrition to financial guidance. \n\nInformation about our Executive Officers and Key Employees \n\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers and key employees as of the filing of this Report: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nName \n\nAge Position \n\nRami Rahim 52 Chief Executive Officer and Director Manoj Leelanivas 53 Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Robert Mobassaly 44 Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Kenneth B.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors \n\nFactors That May Affect Future Results \n\nWe operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Some of these risks are highlighted in the following discussion, and in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Investors should carefully consider all relevant risks before investing in our securities. The occurrence of any of these risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND INDUSTRY \n\nOur quarterly results are unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations; as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our securities could be negatively affected. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance. \n\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business, and the markets for our products and services that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate, include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; unpredictable ordering patterns and limited visibility into our customers&#8217; spending plans and associated revenue; \n\n&#8226; changes in our customer mix, the mix of products and services sold, and the geographies in which our products and services are sold; \n\n&#8226; changes in the demand for our products and services, including seasonal fluctuations in customer spending; \n\n&#8226; changing market and economic conditions, including rising interest rates, recessionary cycles, and inflationary pressures, that could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs for materials, supplies, and services; \n\n&#8226; ability to fulfill orders received in a timely manner due to disruptions and shortages in our global supply chain; \n\n&#8226; increased advance ordering by customers of our products due to industry-wide supply chain concerns and our increased lead times; \n\n&#8226; price and product competition; \n\n&#8226; ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries; \n\n&#8226; how well we execute on our strategy and business model; \n\n&#8226; financial stability of our customers, including the solvency of private sector customers; \n\n&#8226; authority for customers to purchase goods and services; \n\n&#8226; executive orders, tariffs, governmental sanctions, changes in laws or regulations and accounting rules, or interpretations thereof; \n\n&#8226; regional economic and political conditions, which may be aggravated by unanticipated global events; and \n\n&#8226; disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by, among other things, terrorism or other intentional acts, armed conflicts (such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as governmental sanctions imposed in response), cyberwarfare, an escalation of political tensions, outbreaks of disease, such as pandemics, earthquakes, floods, fires, or other natural disasters, including catastrophic events, and other unanticipated extraordinary externalities, including extreme weather conditions due to climate change that increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and may cause derivative disruptions such as impacts to our physical infrastructure or those of our customers, manufacturers, and suppliers. \n\nWe believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. In some prior periods, our operating results have been below our guidance, our long-term financial model or the expectations of securities analysts or investors. This may happen again, and the price of our common stock may decline. In addition, our failure to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders or the failure to meet our commitments to return capital to our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. \n\nWe expect our gross margins and operating margins to vary over time. Our product and service gross margins are expected to vary, and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including, but not limited to, customer, vertical, product and geographic mix shifts, an increase or decrease in our software sales or services we provide, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete, modifications to our pricing strategy to gain footprint in markets or with customers, currency fluctuations that impact our costs or the cost of our products and services to our customers, inflation, increases in material, labor, logistics, warranty costs, or inventory carrying costs, excess product component or obsolescence \n\ncharges from our contract manufacturers, issues with manufacturing or component availability, issues relating to the distribution of our products and provision of our services, quality or efficiencies, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inaccurately forecasting product demand, warranty related issues, the impact of tariffs, or our introduction of new products and enhancements, or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures. We have seen, and may continue to see, our gross margins negatively impacted by continued increases in component costs and inflationary pressures. Failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. \n\nWe derive a material portion of our revenues from a limited number of our customers, and our customers compete in industries that continue to experience consolidation. A material portion of our net revenues, across each customer vertical, depends on sales to a limited number of customers. The concentration of our customer base increases risks related to the financial condition of our customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. If any such customers change their business requirements or focus, vendor selection, project prioritization, or purchasing behavior, or are parties to consolidation transactions, they may delay, suspend, reduce or cancel their purchases of our products or services and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, major customers may also seek more favorable pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which may have a negative impact on our business, cash flow, revenue, and gross margins. \n\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our business and financial results could be harmed. The markets that we serve are rapidly evolving and highly competitive and include several well-established companies. We also compete with other public and private companies that are developing technologies that compete with our products. In addition, actual or speculated consolidation among competitors, or the acquisition by, or of, our partners and/or resellers by competitors can increase the competitive pressures faced by us as customers may delay spending decisions or not purchase our products at all. Our partners and resellers generally sell competing products on a non-exclusive basis and consolidation could delay spending or require us to increase discounts to compete, which could also adversely affect our business. Several of our competitors have substantially greater resources and can offer a wider range of products and services for the overall network equipment market than we do. Other competitors have become more integrated, including through consolidation and vertical integration, and offer a broader range of products and services, which could make their solutions more attractive to our customers. Many of our competitors also sell networking products as bundled solutions with other IT products. If we are unable to compete effectively against existing or future competitors, we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenues and/or be required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nFluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues and gross margin for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues or increase in costs of production may harm our operating results. Our revenues and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness or uncertainty, customer financial difficulties, and constrained spending on network expansion and enterprise infrastructure have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers, manage our contract manufacturer relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, inflationary pressures, continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, including global and regional financial markets, which has led and could lead, to reduced demand for our products, delays or reductions in network expansions or infrastructure projects, and/or higher costs of production. Future or continued economic weakness, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, increases in costs of production, and reductions in spending on network maintenance and expansion could result in price concessions in certain markets or have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nOur business operations have been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on our future results of operations and financial performance remains uncertain. We continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations on a regional, national, and global basis. In 2022, we reopened our facilities world-wide for office-based employees in a new office/hybrid collaboration model. If the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding governmental regulations, or our return to the office process have a substantial impact on the health, attendance or productivity of our employees, partners, or customers, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted. \n\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to experience supply constraints due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as shortages of component parts as our component vendors have experienced manufacturing challenges. We \n\ncontinue to experience extended lead-times to our customers and increased logistics and elevated component costs, which has negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue and decreased our gross margins for these periods, and may impact our ability to convert backlog into revenue. Our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results because a customer may place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed and then cancel an order without significant penalty. Further, customer behaviors have started to change as a result of global macroeconomic factors, and we may not continue to experience a continuation of such demand. Challenges to our supply chain due to the impact of the pandemic remain dynamic, including ongoing shortages of component parts, and we continue to experience increased logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limit the availability of flights on which we are able to ship products. Additionally, cost increases and extended shipping times for ocean transit have increased our dependence on higher-cost air freight. \n\nThe ultimate impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time, such as the transmission rate and geographic spread of the disease and its variants, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners, and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could continue to be adversely affected. \n\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and scale and restructure our business. Our ability to successfully offer our products and services and execute on our growth strategy in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in a cost-effective manner. From time to time, we have increased investment in our business by increasing headcount, acquiring companies, and increasing our investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business. Conversely, in the last few years, we have initiated restructuring plans to realign our workforce as a result of organizational and leadership changes, which resulted in restructuring charges. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to uncertainties. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, if we cannot evolve and scale our business and operations effectively, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nOur acquisitions or divestitures of businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price, and equity issued as consideration for acquisitions may dilute the ownership of our stockholders. We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions to enhance our business and invest significant resources to integrate the businesses we acquire. The success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the business opportunities and manage numerous risks, including, but not limited to: problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, higher operating expenses, liabilities, litigation, diversion of management's time and attention, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains, failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, and the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners of the companies we acquire. \n\nAcquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. There can be no assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire or that the transaction will advance our business strategy. Further, we may not realize anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions. In addition, we have divested, and may in the future divest, businesses, product lines, or assets. These initiatives may also require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention, loss of employees, substantial separation costs, and accounting charges for asset impairments. No assurance can be given that any acquisitions or divestitures will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. \n\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock, or assume equity awards, that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders; use a substantial portion of our cash resources; assume liabilities (both known and unknown); incur tax expenses; record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as well as restructuring and other related expenses. We may incur additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs, thereby limiting our ability to borrow. Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses, product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions. \n\nLong sales and implementation cycles for our products and customer urgency related to ship dates to fill large orders may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. We experience lengthy sales cycles \n\nbecause our customers' decisions to purchase certain of our products, particularly new products, involve a significant commitment of their resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. Customers design and implement large network deployments following lengthy procurement processes, which may impact expected future orders. Following a purchase, customers may also deploy our products slowly and deliberately. Customers with large networks often expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis and place large orders on an irregular basis. These sales and implementation cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will place large orders with urgent ship dates, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. \n\nOur ability to recognize revenue in a particular period is contingent on the timing of product orders and deliveries and/or our sales of certain software, subscriptions, and professional support and maintenance services. In some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. Further, we build certain products only when orders are received. Since the volume of orders received late in any given fiscal quarter remains unpredictable, if orders for custom products are received late in any quarter, we may not be able to recognize revenue for these orders in the same period or meet our expected quarterly revenues. Similarly, if we were to take actions or events occur, which encourage customers to place orders or accept deliveries earlier than anticipated or our customers were to continue to accelerate ordering of our products in response to global supply constraints, extended lead times or other market pressures, our ability to meet our expected revenues in future quarters could be adversely affected. We also determine our operating expenses based on our anticipated revenues and technology roadmap and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. Any failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter-to-quarter. \n\nIn addition, services revenue, including SaaS revenue, accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 33%, 35%, and 36% of total revenue in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We expect our sales of new or renewal professional services, support, maintenance, and SaaS contracts to fluctuate due to end-customers&#8217; level of satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our products and services or those offered by our competitors, and reductions in our end-customers&#8217; spending levels. We recognize professional services when delivered, and we recognize support, maintenance, and SaaS revenue periodically over the term of the relevant service period. \n\nFurther, we recognize certain software revenues periodically over the term of the relevant use or subscription periods and as a result, the related software and support and maintenance revenue we report each fiscal quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. Any fluctuation in such new or renewed contracts in any one fiscal quarter may not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue and could negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS \n\nIf the demand for network and IP systems does not continue to grow, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our business and revenues depends on the growth of secure IP infrastructure as well as customers that depend on the continued growth of IP services to deploy our products in their networks and IP infrastructures. As a result of changes in the economy, capital spending, or the building of network capacity in excess of demand (all of which have, in the past, particularly affected telecommunications service providers), spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a number of our existing customers are evaluating the build-out of their next generation networks. During the decision-making period when our customers are determining the design of those networks and the selection of the software and equipment they will use in those networks, such customers may greatly reduce or suspend their spending on secure IP infrastructure. Any reduction or suspension of spending on IP infrastructure is difficult to predict, and may be due to events beyond our control. This, in turn, can make it more difficult to accurately predict revenues from customers, can cause fluctuations in the level of spending by customers and, even where our products are ultimately selected, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nIf we do not anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer. If we are unable to anticipate future technological shifts, market needs, requirements or opportunities, or fail to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner or at all, it could cause us to lose customers, substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our products and services, and significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if we invest in developing products for a market that does not develop, it could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products, enhancements or business strategies, there can be no assurance that such products, enhancements or business strategies will achieve market acceptance. \n\nOur strategy to expand our software business could adversely affect our competitive position . The success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#8226; the additional development efforts and costs required to create new software products and to make our products compatible with multiple technologies; \n\n&#8226; the possibility that our software products may not achieve widespread customer adoption; \n\n&#8226; the possibility that our strategy could erode our revenue and gross margins; \n\n&#8226; the impact on our financial results of longer periods of revenue recognition for certain types of software products and changes in tax treatment associated with software sales; \n\n&#8226; the additional costs associated with both domestic and international regulatory compliance, data protection, privacy and security laws, industry data security standards, and changes we need to make to our distribution chain in connection with increased software sales; \n\n&#8226; the ability of our disaggregated hardware and software products to operate independently and/or to integrate with current and future third-party products; and \n\n&#8226; issues with third-party technologies used with our software products, which may be attributed to us. \n\nIf any of our software products or business strategies do not gain market acceptance or meet our expectations for growth, our ability to meet future financial targets may be adversely affected and our competitive position and our business and financial results could be harmed. \n\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers&#8217; networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business. Our products are designed to interface with our customers&#8217; existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers&#8217; networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products to meet our customers&#8217; requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers&#8217; networks, we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers&#8217; networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be canceled. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects. \n\nOur products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology. We integrate licensed third-party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required to renegotiate our current third-party licenses or license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements or to facilitate new business models. Third-party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them. In addition, we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products. Third-party technology we incorporate into our products that is deemed to infringe on the intellectual property of others may result, and in some cases has resulted, in limitations on our ability to source technology from those third parties, restrictions on our ability to sell products that incorporate the infringing technology, increased exposure to liability that we will be held responsible for incorporating the infringing technology in our products, and increased costs involved in removing that technology from our products or developing substitute technology. Our inability to comply with, maintain or re-license any third-party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third-party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us to develop substitute technology or obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could delay or prevent product shipment and harm our business and results of operations. \n\nWe may face difficulties enforcing our proprietary rights, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, to protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents with the scope of the claims we seek or that any of our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us or protect our technology. Further, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection, which could prevent our patent applications from issuing as patents or invalidate our patents following issuance, which in turn may prevent us from incorporating our inventions into our products. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, we could incur costly product redesign efforts, discontinue certain product offerings, and experience other competitive harm. \n\nUnauthorized parties may also attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot ensure that we have entered into confidentiality or license agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that these agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. We are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit, stolen, or unfit versions of our products, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future, and could have a negative impact on our reputation and business. \n\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled our success. \n\nWe depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers as well as single-source and limited source suppliers, including for key components such as semiconductors. Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as the ability of our manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide variety of solutions that we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our manufacturers and suppliers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. For example, there is currently a worldwide shortage of key components, such as semiconductor products, that has caused us to experience increased prices and extended lead times. The shortage of semiconductors has caused a significant disruption to our production schedule and may give rise to a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Any delay in our ability to produce and deliver our products could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Other manufacturing and supply problems that we could face are described below. \n\n&#8226; Manufacturing Issues . We may experience supply shortfalls or delays in shipping products to our customers if our manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or if we have to change or add manufacturers or contract manufacturing locations. Although we have contracts with our manufacturers that include terms to protect us in the event of an early termination, we may not have adequate time to transition all of our manufacturing needs to an alternative manufacturer under comparable commercial terms. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future an increase in the expected time required to manufacture our products or ship products. Moreover, a significant portion of our manufacturing is performed in foreign countries and is therefore subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including import restrictions, export restrictions, government sanctions, disruptions to our supply chain, cyberattacks, cyberwarfare, pandemics, regional climate-related events, or regional conflicts. \n\n&#8226; Single-Source Suppliers . We rely on single or limited sources for many of our components due to technology, availability, price, quality, scale or customization needs. Any supplier of such components could discontinue components used in our products, which may cause us to either discontinue certain products or incur additional costs to redesign our products that incorporate discontinued components. In addition, there has been consolidation among certain suppliers of our components. Consolidation among suppliers can result in the reduction of the number of independent suppliers of components available to us, which could negatively impact our ability to access certain component parts or the prices we have to pay for such parts and may impact our gross margins. \n\n&#8226; Supply Chain Disruption. Any disruptions to our supply chain, significant increase in component costs or logistics, or shortages of critical components, could decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to: an extended closure of or any slowdown at our suppliers' plants or shipping delays, market shortages due to the surge in demand from other purchasers for critical components, increases in prices, including fuel prices and increases in prices due to inflation, the imposition of regulations, quotas or embargoes or tariffs on components or our products themselves, labor stoppages, transportation delays, including due to labor strikes, or failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods, third-party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain, cyberattacks, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, adverse effects of climate change, natural disasters, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism and disruptions in utilities and other services. In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply \n\nchain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business. \n\n&#8226; Component Supply Forecast . We provide demand forecasts for our products to our manufacturers, who order components and plan capacity based on these forecasts. If we overestimate our requirements, our manufacturers may assess charges, or we may have liabilities for excess inventory or raw materials, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. If we underestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate time, materials, and/or components required to produce our products. This could increase costs or delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products, resulting in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues and could negatively impact customer satisfaction. Any future spike in growth in our business, in the use of certain components we share in common with other companies, in IT spending, or in the economy in general, is likely to create greater short-term pressure on us and our suppliers to accurately forecast overall component demand and to establish optimal component inventories. If shortages or delays persist, we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build and deliver products in a timely manner, and our revenues, gross margins and customer relationships could suffer. \n\n&#8226; Alternative Sources of Supply . The development of alternate sources for components is time-consuming, difficult, and costly. In the event of a component shortage, supply interruption or significant price increase from these suppliers (such as with the current worldwide shortage of semiconductor products or due to the impact of the war between Ukraine and Russia), we may not be able to locate alternative sources in a timely manner. In addition, certain raw materials used in our industry&#8217;s extended supply chain come from Ukraine or Russia, such as neon, palladium, cobalt, and others. Poor relations between the U.S. and Russia, sanctions by the U.S., EU, and other countries against Russia, the response by Russia and other countries to these sanctions, and any escalation of political tensions or economic instability in the region could have an adverse impact on us and our suppliers. Further, our suppliers may have staff, operations, materials or equipment located in Ukraine or Russia, which could impact our supply chain or services being provided to us. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products and services to our customers, which would seriously affect present and future sales, and would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; COVID-19 Impact. Delays in production or in product deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, we have experienced supply constraints due to both constrained manufacturing capacity, as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing supply constraints, and increased logistics costs due to air travel and transport restrictions that limited the availability of flights on which we ship our products. Additionally, cost increases and extended shipping times for ocean transit have increased our dependence on higher-cost air freight. These challenges have resulted in extended lead-times to our customers and have had a negative impact on our ability to recognize associated revenue and has resulted in and may continue to result in an increase in accelerated ordering for certain of our products. We continue to work with government authorities and implement safety measures to help ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; however, we could still experience an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain that could impact our operations. \n\nWe face significant risks to our business and operations due to political and economic tensions between China and Taiwan . We have significant business operations in Taiwan, and some of our manufacturing partners and suppliers have facilities in Taiwan. As a result, our operations and our supply chain could be materially and negatively impacted by adverse changes in China-Taiwan relations, which have become increasingly frayed in recent years. Accordingly, further deterioration in military, political and economic relations between China and Taiwan, as well as the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty between the U.S. and China, the unknown impact of current and future U.S. and Chinese trade regulations and other geopolitical risks with respect to China and Taiwan, may cause disruptions in the markets and industries we serve, including decreased demand from customers for products using our solutions, our supply chain, or other disruptions which may, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our stock. \n\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyberattacks could compromise our and our customers&#8217; proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our products. In the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal data, our proprietary business information and that of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners on our networks. In addition, we store sensitive data through cloud-based services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties. Secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have been, and expect to be, subject to cyberattacks, and may be subject to ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks, spearfishing attacks and other attempted intrusions on our networks and systems by a wide range of actors, including, but not limited to, nation states, criminal enterprises, terrorist organizations, and other organizations or individuals, as well as errors, wrongful \n\nconduct or malfeasance by employees and third-party service providers (collectively, &#8220;malicious parties&#8221;). We expect our third-party vendors to be subject to similar cyberattacks, ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks, spearfishing attacks and other attempted intrusions. The increasing occurrence of high-profile data breaches and ransomware attacks in addition to geopolitical unrest, provides evidence of an environment increasingly hostile to information security. \n\nDespite our security measures, and those of our third-party vendors, our information systems, infrastructure, and data have experienced security incidents and breaches and may be subject to or vulnerable to breaches or attacks, including ransomware and distributed denial-of-service attacks. If any breach or attack compromises our networks or those of our vendors, creates system disruptions or slowdowns, or exploits security vulnerabilities or critical security defects of our products and services, the information stored on our networks or the networks of our customers, suppliers or business partners could be accessed and modified, publicly disclosed, lost, destroyed or stolen, and we may be subject to claims for contractual, tort, or equitable liability and suffer reputational and financial harm. In addition, malicious parties may compromise our software, including the open-source software used in our products, or our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious hardware, components, and software that are designed to defeat or circumvent encryption and other cybersecurity measures to interfere with the operation of our networks, expose us or our products to cyberattacks, or gain unauthorized access to our or our customers&#8217; systems and information. If such actions are successful, they could diminish customer trust in our products, harm our business reputation, and adversely affect our business and financial condition. \n\nBecause techniques used by malicious parties to access or sabotage networks are sophisticated, change frequently, and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques or the vulnerabilities they have caused or other potential vulnerabilities or security defects. Further, when vulnerabilities are discovered, we evaluate the risk, prioritize our responses, apply patches or take other remediation actions and notify customers, business partners, and suppliers, as appropriate. Exploitation of vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions, could, in each case, result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. \n\nAll of this requires significant resources and attention from management and our employees, and the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate these issues could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure. The market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our overall reputation could also be harmed as a result of any actual or perceived breach of security that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the systems of other vendors and/or to actions of malicious parties. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. \n\nAdditionally, we could be subject to measures that regulate the security of the types of products we sell. Such regulations may result in increased costs and delays in product releases and changes in features to achieve compliance, which may impact customer demand for our products, and result in regulatory investigations, potential fines, and litigation in connection with a compliance concern, security breach or related issue, and potential liability to third parties arising from such breaches. Further, in response to actual or anticipated cybersecurity regulations or contractual security requirements negotiated with our customers, we may need to make changes to existing policies, processes, and supplier relationships that could impact product offerings, release schedules and service response times, which could adversely affect the demand for and sales of our products and services. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. If our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate, or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. \n\nDisruption in our distribution channels could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. The majority of our revenues are derived through value-added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell our competitors&#8217; products, and some of which sell their own competing products. The loss of or reduction in sales to our resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in leveraging their market share positions or in providing incentives to current or potential resellers and distributors to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with our partners, develop new relationships with value-added resellers and distributors in new markets, expand the number of distributors and resellers in existing markets, manage, train or motivate existing value-added resellers and distributors effectively, or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer. We recognize a portion of our revenues at the time we sell products to our distributors. If these sales are made based on inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted. Further, our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. \n\nTo develop and expand our distribution channel, we continue to offer attractive channel programs to potential partners and have previously entered into OEM agreements with partners to rebrand and resell our products as part of their product portfolios. These relationships require processes and procedures that may be costly or challenging to implement, maintain, and manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products. We also depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Any failure by our partners to comply with these requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\nWe rely on the performance of our business systems and third-party systems and processes. Some of our business processes depend upon our IT systems, the IT systems and processes of third parties, and the interfaces between the two, as well as hosted SaaS applications from third parties. For example, we receive a broad range of information technology services, such as applications, including support, development and maintenance; infrastructure management and support, including for server storage and network devices; and end user support. Some of these services are provided to us through cloud providers, third party providers, and off-site facilities that may be vulnerable to damage or interruption, including performance problems from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, adverse events caused by operator error, cybersecurity attacks, pandemics, and similar events. In addition, because we lease, rather than own, off-site data center facilities, we cannot be assured that we will be able to expand our data center infrastructure to meet user demand in a timely manner, or on favorable financial terms. If we have issues receiving and processing data, this may delay our ability to provide products and services to our customers and business partners and damage our business. We also rely upon the performance of the systems and processes of our contract manufacturers to build and ship our products. If those systems and processes experience interruption or delay, the manufacture and shipment of our products in a timely manner may be impaired. Since IT is critical to our operations, in addition to the risks outlined above, problems with any of the third parties we rely on for our IT systems and services, could result in liabilities to our customers and business partners, lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. We could also face significant additional costs or business disruption if our arrangements with these third parties are terminated or impaired and we cannot find alternative services or support on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis or if we are unable to hire new employees in order to provide these services in-house. \n\nOur ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel or if our existing personnel are harmed by COVID-19. Our future success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, engineering, technical, sales, marketing, and support personnel, as well as our ability to maintain the health of our personnel. The supply of highly qualified individuals with technological and creative skills, in particular engineers, in specialized areas with the expertise to develop new products and enhancements for our current products, and provide reliable product maintenance, as well as the number of salespeople with industry expertise, is limited. Competition for people with the specialized technical skills we require is significant and may cause us to incur increased compensation expenses to attract and retain employees with the skills to support our business needs. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. If we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel, the development and introduction of new products could be delayed, our ability to market, sell, or support our products could be impaired, and our business, results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer. \n\nA number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the U.S. and other countries. In recent years, the U.S. has increased the level of scrutiny in granting H-1B, L-1, and other business visas. Compliance with new and unexpected U.S. immigration and labor laws could also require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain and attract skilled professionals. Additionally, circumstances related to or in response to pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel. Any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. \n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters. There is an increasing focus from U.S. and foreign government agencies, certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters. We may communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other corporate social responsibility and ESG matters, in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, on our website, in our SEC filings, and elsewhere. These initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of these initiatives and goals as a result of rapidly evolving ESG definitions, rules, and regulations, including the SEC's proposed rules related to emissions disclosures and other ESG matters, such as internal planning issues and factors that are beyond our control, including those involving third parties. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. Our reputation or other aspects of our business could be negatively impacted by all such matters, with potential material adverse effects. \n\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS \n\nWe are a party to lawsuits, investigations, and other disputes. We have been named a party to litigation involving a broad range of matters, including commercial transactions, employment matters, patent infringement, copyrights, trademarks, and other rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products, as well as governmental claims, and securities laws, and we may be named in additional litigation and/or governmental claims. For example, certain U.S. governmental agencies previously conducted investigations into possible violations by us of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which ultimately resulted in the Company entering into a settlement with the SEC that involved, among other things, the Company making a payment of $11.8 million in August 2019. Future claims or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, partners, or customers. Future claims asserted and/or litigation may be initiated by third parties, including whistleblowers, and may relate to infringement of proprietary rights, issues arising under the False Claims Act, compliance with securities laws, or other matters. The expense of initiating and defending, and in some cases settling, such litigation and investigations may be costly, and may cause us to suffer reputational harm, divert management&#8217;s attention from day-to-day operations of our business, and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could disrupt our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition, if we fail to comply with the terms of any settlement agreement, we could face more substantial penalties. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. \n\nFurther, increased patent litigation brought by non-practicing entities may result, and in some cases has resulted, in our customers requesting or requiring us to absorb a portion of the costs of such litigation or providing broader indemnification for litigation, each of which could increase our expenses and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they may require us to develop alternative technologies, enter into license agreements, or cease engaging in certain activities or offering certain products or services. Furthermore, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled at significant costs to us because of the potential for high awards of damages or injunctive relief. \n\nIf any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us or anyone we are required to indemnify is successful and we are required to pay significant monetary awards or damages to settle litigation, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or we fail to develop non-infringing technology and we incorporate infringing technology in our products, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nNon-standard contract terms with telecommunications, cable, and cloud service provider companies, and other large customers, including large enterprise customers, could have an adverse effect on our business or impact the amount of revenues to be recognized. Telecommunications, cable, and cloud service provider companies, and other large companies, including large enterprise customers, generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers. As one such supplier, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect the amount or timing of or our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Consolidation among such large customers can further increase their buying power and ability to require onerous terms from us. \n\nRegulations of our industry or of our customers could harm our operating results and future prospects. We are subject to laws, regulations, and policies affecting the sale of our products in a number of areas. For example, some governments have regulations prohibiting customers (both government and commercial) from purchasing products that do not meet country-specific safety, conformance, or security certification criteria or in-country test requirements. Other regulations that may negatively impact our business include local content or local manufacturing requirements most commonly applicable for government, state-owned enterprise, or regulated industry procurements. These types of regulations are in effect or under consideration in several jurisdictions where we do business. \n\nThe SEC requires us, as a public company that uses certain raw materials considered to be &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; in our products, to report publicly on the extent to which &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; are in our supply chain. As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining, smelting, or refining of any conflict minerals. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of these raw materials is limited. Our relationships with customers, suppliers, and investors could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as &#8220;conflict-free.&#8221; We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements. \n\nEnvironmental laws and regulations relevant to electronic equipment manufacturing or operations, including laws and regulations governing the hazardous material content of our products and the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment, may adversely impact our business and financial condition. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change \n\nlaws, and regulations and product take-back legislation, which could require us to cease selling non-compliant products and to reengineer our products to use compliant components, which could result in additional costs to us, disrupt our operations, and result in an adverse impact on our operating results. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, our customers may refuse to purchase our products and we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict. \n\nIn addition, as a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. government, we are subject to federal regulations pertaining to our IT systems that require compliance with certain security and privacy controls. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in a loss of federal government business, subject us to claims or other remedies for non-compliance, or negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nFurther, some government customers have implemented and could continue to implement procurement policies that impact our profitability. Procurement policies favoring more non-commercial purchases, different pricing, or evaluation criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer&#8217;s view of what our pricing should be, could affect the margins on such contracts or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs. Moreover, the failure to comply with government contracting provisions could result in penalties or the ineligibility to compete for future contracts. Government customers are continually evaluating their contract pricing and financing practices, and we have no assurance regarding what changes will be proposed, if any, and their impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. \n\nMoreover, our commercial customers in the telecommunications industry may be subject to regulations and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in such regulations affecting our customers. Further, we could be affected by new laws or regulations on access to or commerce on IP networks in jurisdictions where we market our solutions. Regulations governing the range of services and business models that can be offered by service providers or cloud provider companies could adversely affect those customers' needs for products. Also, many jurisdictions have or are evaluating regulations relating to cybersecurity, supply chain integrity, privacy and data protection, any of which can affect the market and requirements for networking and security equipment. Additionally, certain countries where our customers operate may require that our products sold in that country be made locally or made in particular geographies, or satisfy local regulations for critical infrastructure projects, either of which could impact our ability to compete in those markets and may also negatively impact our margins due to the costs incurred to comply with these requirements. \n\nThe adoption and implementation of additional regulations could reduce demand for our products, increase the cost of building and selling our products, result in product inventory write-offs, impact our ability to ship products into affected areas and recognize revenue in a timely manner, require us to spend significant time and expense to comply with, and subject us to fines and civil or criminal sanctions or claims if we were to violate or become liable under such regulations. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nGovernmental regulations, economic sanctions and other legal restrictions that affect international trade or affect movement and disposition of our products and component parts could negatively affect our revenues and operating results. The U.S. and other governments have imposed restrictions on the import and export of, among other things, certain telecommunications products and components, particularly those that contain or use encryption technology. Most of our products are telecommunications products that contain or use encryption technology and, consequently, are subject to restrictions. The scope, nature, and severity of such controls vary widely across different countries and may change frequently over time. In many cases, these government restrictions require a license prior to importing or exporting a good. Such licensing requirements can introduce delays into our operations as we or our channel partners must apply for the license and wait for government officials to process it or perform pre-shipment inspections; it is possible that lengthy delays will lead to the cancellation of orders by customers. Moreover, if we, our suppliers, or our channel partners fail to obtain necessary licenses prior to importing or exporting covered goods, we can be subject to government sanctions, including monetary penalties, conditions, and restrictions. Such license requirements, and any fines or other sanctions imposed for their violation could negatively affect our revenues and operating results. \n\nIn addition, the U.S. and other governments have especially broad sanctions and embargoes prohibiting provision of goods or services to certain countries, territories, sanctioned governments, businesses, and individuals. We have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into restricted countries or to prohibited entities or individuals, but there can be no assurance that our third party, downstream resellers, and distributors will abide by these restrictions or have processes in place to ensure compliance. \n\nCertain governments also impose special local content, certification, testing, source code review, escrow, and governmental recovery of private encryption keys, or other cybersecurity feature requirements to protect network equipment and software procured by or for the government. Similar requirements also may be imposed in procurements by state owned entities or even private companies forming part of &#8220;critical network infrastructure&#8221; or supporting sensitive industries. \n\nIn recent years, U.S. government officials have had concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in China, Russia, and other regions. As a result, the U.S. government has imposed bans on the use of certain Chinese-origin and Russian-origin components or systems either in items sold to the U.S. government or in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors (even if those networks are not used for government-related projects). U.S. regulations also permit the U.S. government to investigate and possibly mandate the unwinding of commercial transactions between U.S. companies and foreign suppliers. This introduces uncertainty into our supply chain, our imports of end products and our overall operational planning. \n\nIn May 2021, the U.S. President issued an executive order on cybersecurity that signals the U.S. government&#8217;s interest in developing standards and guidelines pertaining to Information and Communication Technology supply chains, government network capabilities and requirements, and cyber threat and vulnerability remediation. Any or all of these standards and guidelines could impact how we develop hardware and software, what features our products have, and our role in helping the U.S. government respond to cyber threats and vulnerabilities. \n\nIn response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. and certain allies have imposed sanctions against the Russian government and other entities, which led to our suspension of operations in Russia, Belarus, and in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea regions of Ukraine. Accordingly, we are not able to sell or deliver our products or provide ongoing support services to our customers in Russia, Belarus, and in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea regions of Ukraine. The response by Russia and other countries to these sanctions could lead to an escalation of political tensions, economic instability in the area, and cyberwarfare. These actions, as well as the effect of such actions on macroeconomic conditions, could have an adverse impact on our business and operations. \n\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A wide variety of provincial, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development and offering of new products and services. In addition, the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection-related laws in some cases is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes, including the potential for various regulator or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties. Moreover, there are a number of other legislative proposals worldwide, including in the U.S. at both the federal and state level, that could impose additional and potentially conflicting obligations in areas affecting our business. Examples of recent and anticipated developments that have impacted or could impact our business include the following: \n\n&#8226; The EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. As GDPR enforcement evolves, we may find it necessary to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA residents&#8217; personal data, and our actions in addressing such environment, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed. In addition, we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel, and negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\n&#8226; Data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. State laws that are being enacted may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, adapt our goods and services, and incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. Some state laws impose civil penalties on violators and authorize private rights of action, both of which might lead to an increase in the frequency and cost associated with data breach litigation. \n\n&#8226; The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. \n\n&#8226; We may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored within that country. \n\n&#8226; Both U.S. federal and state, and non-U.S. governments are considering laws and regulations governing artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) and machine learning tools that leverage commercial and consumer data, such as the EU's draft Artificial Intelligence Act. If finalized, these laws may impact some of our products and services, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply. \n\n&#8226; Among other emerging global privacy laws, India has released its draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022. Given our significant employee and operational presence in India, passage of the bill may cause us to incur increased costs in order to implement new processes necessary to comply with the new regulation. \n\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Further, evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the EU, the U.S., U.K., and elsewhere, including the classification of IP addresses, machine identification information, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting business relationships and partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant costs, resources, and efforts in order to comply. \n\nFINANCIAL RISKS \n\nOur financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets. As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill was $3,734.4 million, and our purchased intangible assets were $160.5 million. We are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually or, in certain instances, more frequently, and may be required to record impairment charges, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. Our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. However, any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nChanges in effective tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results. Our future effective tax rates and the amount of our taxable income could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by the following: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; changes in the research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) tax laws applicable to us; transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions, including the license of acquired intangibles under our intercompany R&#38;D cost sharing arrangement; costs related to intercompany restructuring; tax effects of share-based compensation; challenges to our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements; limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense; or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Our future effective tax rate may be impacted by judicial decisions, changes in interpretation of regulations, as well as additional legislation and guidance. \n\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals may become law, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows. In August 2022, the U.S. enacted both the Inflation Reduction Act (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) and the CHIPS and Science Act into law. The former includes a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock buybacks. While we are awaiting further guidance from the U.S. Treasury, we have assessed preliminary guidance and do not expect either the IRA or the CHIPS and Science Act to have a material impact. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the &#8220;OECD&#8221;), an international association of 38 countries, including the U.S., has issued guidelines that change long-standing tax principles. The OECD guidelines may introduce tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the guidelines. Some countries have enacted, and others have proposed, taxes based on gross receipts applicable to digital services, regardless of profitability. Substantially all member countries of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreed to certain tax principles, including a global minimum tax of 15%. In December 2022, the EU reached unanimous agreement, in principle, to implement the global minimum tax. EU members will be required to institute local laws in 2023, which are intended to be effective for tax years beginning after 2023. Additional changes to global tax laws are likely to occur, and such changes may adversely affect our tax liability. \n\nIn addition, we are generally subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, but the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \n\nWe are subject to risks arising from our international operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and value-added resellers in countries throughout the world and depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the U.S. In addition, a portion of our R&#38;D and our general and administrative operations are conducted outside the U.S. As a result of our international operations, we are affected by economic, business, regulatory, social, and political conditions in foreign countries, including the following: \n\n&#8226; changes in general IT spending; \n\n&#8226; global macroeconomic conditions, including recessionary cycles; \n\n&#8226; the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and any other adverse public health developments, epidemic disease or other pandemic in the countries in which we operate or where our customers are located; \n\n&#8226; the imposition of government controls, inclusive of critical infrastructure protection; \n\n&#8226; changes in trade controls, economic sanctions, or other international trade regulations, which may affect our ability to import or export our products to or from various countries; \n\n&#8226; laws that restrict sales of products that are developed, manufactured, or incorporate components or assemblies sourced from certain countries or suppliers to specific customers and industry segments, or for particular uses; \n\n&#8226; varying and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, changes in laws and interpretation of laws, misappropriation of intellectual property and reduced intellectual property protection; \n\n&#8226; political uncertainty, including demonstrations, that could have an impact on product delivery; \n\n&#8226; impact of geopolitical tensions, challenges, and uncertainties as a result of armed conflicts and resulting sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries against governmental or other entities, that may lead to disruption, instability, and volatility in global and regional financial markets, as well as higher inflation, increases in prices of commodities, and disruptions to supply chains; \n\n&#8226; increased tensions among the U.S., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia that could increase the threat of armed conflict, cyberwarfare and economic instability and could disrupt or delay operations or resources in Ukraine or Russia, disrupt or delay communication with such resources or the flow of funds to support operations, or otherwise render our resources unavailable; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in local economies, including inflationary conditions that could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in currency exchange rates (see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information); \n\n&#8226; tax policies, treaties, or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact; \n\n&#8226; the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the U.S. and other nations; \n\n&#8226; data privacy rules and other regulations that affect cross border data flow; and \n\n&#8226; theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and other confidential business information. \n\nAny or all of these factors has or could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nMoreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from or conflict with those in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate. In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations. Certain countries (such as Russia, China, and EU member nations with regard to Iran trade) prohibit individuals and companies resident in or operating within their borders to comply with foreign sanctions imposed on such countries themselves or on third countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, channel partners, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures, which are designed to help ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners, or agents could result in termination of our relationship, financial reporting problems, fines, and/or penalties for us, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1,700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes, which we refer to collectively as the &#8220;Notes&#8221;. In April 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. \n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to satisfy our expenses, make anticipated capital expenditures or service our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to pay our expenses, satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures is dependent upon our future performance and other factors discussed in this section. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. \n\nThe indenture that governs the Notes contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: incur liens, incur sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another person. Further, the Credit Agreement contains two financial covenants along with customary affirmative and negative covenants that include the following: \n\n&#8226; maintenance of a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x (provided that if a material acquisition has been consummated, we are permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.5x for up to four quarters) and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0x; and \n\n&#8226; covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. \n\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business. In addition, under applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations, there are limitations on the deductibility of net business interest expenses. As a result, if our taxable income were to decline, we may not be able to fully deduct our net interest expense, which could have a material impact on our business. \n\nFurther, we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that influence our credit ratings include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. \n\nOur investments are subject to risks, which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. We have substantial investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, foreign government debt securities, money market funds, mutual funds, time deposits, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. government securities. We also have investments in privately-held companies. Certain of our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, sovereign debt, and interest rate risks. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value related to creditworthiness of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be material. In addition, should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may be subject to risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS \n\nFailing to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, or any weaknesses in our internal controls may adversely affect investor perception, and our stock price. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures to manage and grow our business effectively in the future. We are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. If in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to not be effective, resulting in a material weakness, investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected, which could cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition. \n\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum. The exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read with the Business section in Item 1 of Part I and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview, which includes a financial results and key performance metrics overview and a discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management such as the COVID-19 pandemic and global component shortage. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. \n\nExecutive Overview \n\nFinancial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview \n\nThe following table provides an overview of our financial results and key financial metrics (in millions, except per share amounts, percentages, and days sales outstanding, or DSO): \n\n##TABLE_START As of and for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Net revenues $ 5,301.2 $ 4,735.4 $ 565.8 12 % Gross margin $ 2,958.3 $ 2,740.1 $ 218.2 8 % Percentage of net revenues 55.8 % 57.9 % Operating income $ 519.1 $ 387.5 $ 131.6 34 % Percentage of net revenues 9.8 % 8.2 % Net income $ 471.0 $ 252.7 $ 218.3 86 % Percentage of net revenues 8.9 % 5.3 % Net income per share Basic $ 1.46 $ 0.78 $ 0.68 87 % Diluted $ 1.43 $ 0.76 $ 0.67 88 % Operating cash flows $ 97.6 $ 689.7 $ (592.1) (86) % Stock repurchase plan activity $ 299.7 $ 433.3 $ (133.6) (31) % Cash dividends declared per common stock $ 0.84 $ 0.80 $ 0.04 5 % \n\nDSO (1) \n\n76 69 7 10 % Deferred revenue: Deferred product revenue $ 108.8 $ 129.1 $ (20.3) (16) % Deferred service revenue 1,554.3 1,284.5 269.8 21 % Total $ 1,663.1 $ 1,413.6 $ 249.5 18 % Deferred revenue from customer solutions (2) \n\n$ 632.8 $ 442.1 $ 190.7 43 % Deferred revenue from hardware maintenance and professional services 1,030.3 971.5 58.8 6 % Total $ 1,663.1 $ 1,413.6 $ 249.5 18 % ##TABLE_END\n\n________________________________ \n\n(1) DSO is for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. \n\n(2) Includes deferred revenue from hardware solutions, software licenses, software support and maintenance and SaaS offerings sold in our Automated WAN Solutions, Cloud-Ready Data Center, and AI-Driven Enterprise customer solution categories. \n\n&#8226; Net Revenues: Net revenues increased during 2022 compared to 2021 across all of our verticals, customer solutions, and geographies. Service net revenues increased primarily due to strong sales of software subscriptions. \n\n&#8226; Gross Margin: Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2022 compared to 2021. Product gross margin decreased primarily due to incremental component costs due to supply chain constraints and product mix, partially offset by higher software revenue and pricing actions. The decrease in product gross margin was partially offset by the increase in service gross margin, which was primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. \n\n&#8226; Operating Margin: Operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by the drivers described in the gross margin discussion above and higher personnel-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount. \n\n&#8226; Operating Cash Flows: Net cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to higher supplier payments for inventory and contract manufacturer deposits in order to address significant industry-wide supply constraints. As of December 31, 2022, our inventory balance was $642.9 million, an increase of $358.7 million from the prior year, and our contract manufacturer deposit balance was $434.7 million, an increase of $210.9 million from the prior year. We also had approximately $140 million in tax payments attributed to the capitalization and amortization requirements for R&#38;D expenditures pursuant to the Tax Act. The increase in payments was partially offset by higher collections from increased invoicing activity. \n\n&#8226; Capital Return: We continue to return capital to our stockholders. During 2022, we repurchased a total of 9.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $32.32 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $299.7 million. During 2022, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.21 per share, for an aggregate amount of $270.4 million. \n\n&#8226; DSO: DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net revenues for the preceding 90 days. DSO increased, primarily driven by higher overall invoicing, partially offset by higher revenue. \n\n&#8226; Deferred Revenue: Total deferred revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in deferrals of SaaS and software license subscriptions. \n\nGlobal Component Shortage and COVID-19 Pandemic Update \n\nWe continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations on a regional, national, and global basis. In 2022, we reopened our facilities world-wide for office-based employees in a new office/hybrid collaboration model. We do not expect the pandemic to have a substantial net impact on our consolidated operating results or our liquidity position. \n\nWe have a global supply chain, which is primarily composed of manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Global supply chain constraints in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in disruption to our production schedule due to both constrained manufacturing capacity as well as component parts shortages as our component vendors were also facing manufacturing challenges. These challenges resulted in extended lead times of certain products to our customers, increased logistics costs, and impacted the volume of products we were able to deliver, which negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue. To meet our customer needs, our supply chain team has been executing on a strong risk mitigation plan to resolve our challenges, further enhance our supply chain resiliency, and mitigate the effects of disruptions including, multi-sourcing, pre-ordering components, transforming our logistics network, prioritizing critical customers, and partnering on solutions that limit disruptions to our operations while ensuring the safety of our employees, partners, and suppliers. \n\nSimilar to others, we continue to experience elevated component costs and inventory balances. These have had a negative impact on our gross margin and operating cash flow. We believe some of the strength in previous product orders was attributable to these industry supply chain challenges that were causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed, which resulted in significantly elevated backlog levels. In the third and fourth quarter of 2022, we saw a decline in product orders as buying patterns normalized and customers consumed previously placed orders. We anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels but expect it to decline as supply improves. \n\nWe believe the extended lead times and increased component and logistic costs will modestly improve through the course of 2023. We have taken pricing actions to mitigate some of the effects of rising component costs and general inflationary pressures arising from supply chain constraints as well as overall macroeconomic conditions, and expect these actions to have a more substantial impact in 2023. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components and will be able to meet our full-year financial forecast. See the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part II of this Report for further discussion of this risk. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe below accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. \n\n&#8226; Revenue Recognition: We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain non-standard terms and conditions and include promises to transfer multiple goods or services. As a result, significant interpretation and judgment are sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions, including: (1) whether performance obligations are considered distinct that should be accounted for separately versus together, how the price should be allocated among the performance obligations, and when to recognize revenue for each performance obligation; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct performance obligation; (3) combining contracts that may impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services; and (4) estimating and accounting for variable consideration, including rights of return, rebates, price protection, expected penalties or other price concessions as a reduction of the transaction price. \n\nOur estimates of SSP for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to, historical discounting trends for products and services, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles. Our estimates for rights of return, rebates, and price protection are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in customer contracts or rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Our estimates for expected penalties and other price concessions are based on historical trends and expectations regarding future incurrence. \n\nChanges in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition. \n\n&#8226; Income Taxes: We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We apply the authoritative accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes including the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. \n\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies , in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 can be found under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022, which is available on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at http://investor.juniper.net. \n\nRevenues \n\nThe following table presents net revenues by customer solution, customer vertical, and geographic region (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Customer Solutions: Automated WAN Solutions $ 1,865.3 $ 1,665.0 $ 200.3 12 % Percentage of net revenues 35.2 % 35.2 % Cloud-Ready Data Center 878.9 727.1 151.8 21 % Percentage of net revenues 16.6 % 15.4 % AI-Driven Enterprise 1,026.2 830.4 195.8 24 % Percentage of net revenues 19.4 % 17.5 % Hardware Maintenance and Professional Services 1,530.8 1,512.9 17.9 1 % Percentage of net revenues 28.8 % 31.9 % Total net revenues $ 5,301.2 $ 4,735.4 $ 565.8 12 % Customer Verticals: Cloud $ 1,393.6 $ 1,228.0 $ 165.6 13 % Percentage of net revenues 26.3 % 25.9 % Service Provider 1,891.2 1,839.1 52.1 3 % Percentage of net revenues 35.7 % 38.8 % Enterprise 2,016.4 1,668.3 348.1 21 % Percentage of net revenues 38.0 % 35.3 % Total net revenues $ 5,301.2 $ 4,735.4 $ 565.8 12 % Geographic Regions: Americas: United States $ 2,931.6 $ 2,426.9 $ 504.7 21 % Other 225.2 222.2 3.0 1 % Total Americas 3,156.8 2,649.1 507.7 19 % Percentage of net revenues 59.6 % 55.9 % EMEA 1,370.0 1,314.5 55.5 4 % Percentage of net revenues 25.8 % 27.8 % APAC 774.4 771.8 2.6 &#8212; % Percentage of net revenues 14.6 % 16.3 % Total net revenues $ 5,301.2 $ 4,735.4 $ 565.8 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal net revenues increased across all customer solutions mainly driven by higher sales volume. \n\nThe Automated WAN Solutions and the Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue increased across all verticals. \n\nThe AI-Driven Enterprise revenue increase was primarily driven by Enterprise and Service Provider, partially offset by a decline in Cloud. \n\nAlso, software and security products and services represent key areas of our strategic focus that are critical components to our business success. Software and related service offerings include revenue from software license, software support and maintenance and SaaS contracts. Total security offerings include revenue from our complete portfolio of hardware and software security products, including SD-WAN solutions, as well as services related to our security solutions. \n\nThe following table presents net revenues from software and security products and services (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Software and Related Services $ 994.2 $ 760.9 $ 233.3 31 % Percentage of net revenues 18.8 % 16.1 % Total Security $ 628.6 $ 656.9 $ (28.3) (4) % Percentage of net revenues 11.9 % 13.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nGross Margins \n\nThe following table presents gross margins (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change &#160; Product gross margin $ 1,778.2 $ 1,668.7 $ 109.5 7 % Percentage of product revenues 50.2 % 54.2 % Service gross margin 1,180.1 1,071.4 108.7 10 % Percentage of service revenues 67.0 % 64.6 % Total gross margin $ 2,958.3 $ 2,740.1 $ 218.2 8 % Percentage of net revenues 55.8 % 57.9 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOur gross margins as a percentage of net revenues have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including general inflationary pressures, the mix and average selling prices of our products and services, new product introductions and enhancements, manufacturing, component and logistics costs, expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations, cost of support and service personnel, customer mix as we continue to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, the mix of distribution channels through which our products and services are sold, and import tariffs. For example, our logistics and other supply chain-related costs have increased due to the ongoing global component shortage. For more information on the impact of supply chain constraints on our business, see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of Item 1A of Part I of this Report . \n\nProduct gross margin \n\nProduct gross margin as a percentage of product revenues decreased primarily due to $64.8 million in incremental component costs due to supply chain constraints and product mix, partially offset by higher software revenue and pricing actions. We continue to undertake specific efforts to address certain factors impacting our product gross margin. These efforts include performance and quality improvements through engineering to increase value across our products; optimizing our supply chain and service business; pricing management; and increasing software and solution sales. \n\nService gross margin \n\nService gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower delivery costs. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nThe following table presents operating expenses (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change &#160; Research and development $ 1,036.1 $ 1,007.2 $ 28.9 3 % Percentage of net revenues 19.5 % 21.3 % Sales and marketing 1,133.4 1,052.7 80.7 8 % Percentage of net revenues 21.4 % 22.2 % General and administrative 249.5 249.8 (0.3) &#8212; % Percentage of net revenues 4.7 % 5.3 % Restructuring charges 20.2 42.9 (22.7) (53) % Percentage of net revenues 0.4 % 0.9 % Total operating expenses $ 2,439.2 $ 2,352.6 $ 86.6 4 % Percentage of net revenues 46.0 % 49.7 % ##TABLE_END\n\nOur operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including salaries and wages; commissions and bonuses, which we refer to collectively as variable compensation; benefits; share-based compensation; and travel. Facility and information technology, or IT, departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. We had a total of 10,901 and 10,191 employees as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Our headcount increased by 710 employees, or 7%, primarily from hiring for the research and development and sales and marketing organizations. We expect inflationary pressures to impact operating expense, at least for the next twelve months. \n\nResearch and development \n\nResearch and development expense, or R&#38;D, increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs driven by headcount growth. \n\nSales and marketing \n\nSales and marketing expense, or S&#38;M, increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs driven by headcount growth, higher variable compensation and higher travel expenses, as well as higher costs associated with marketing initiatives. \n\nRestructuring charges \n\nRestructuring charges decreased primarily due to lower contract termination, facility consolidation, severance and other exit-related costs recorded in 2022 under the 2022 Restructuring Plan, compared to the charges recorded in 2021 under the 2021 Restructuring Plan. \n\nGain on Divestiture \n\nThe following table presents the gain on divestiture (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Gain on divestiture $ 45.8 $ &#8212; $ 45.8 N/M Percentage of net revenues 0.9 % &#8212; % ##TABLE_END\n\n______________________ \n\nN/M - Not meaningful \n\nIn 2022, we recognized a gain of $45.8 million related to the divestiture of our silicon photonics business for cash consideration of $90.0 million and a 25% equity interest in the business. For further discussion of the divestiture, see Note 2, Divestiture , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. \n\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt \n\nThe following table presents the loss on extinguishment of debt (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Loss on extinguishment of debt $ &#8212; $ (60.6) $ 60.6 N/M Percentage of net revenues &#8212; % (1.3) % ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________________ \n\nN/M - Not meaningful \n\nIn 2021, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $60.6 million related to the redemption of our Senior Notes maturing in 2024 and June 2025. The loss primarily consisted of a premium on the early redemption and acceleration of unamortized debt discount and fees on the redeemed debt. \n\nOther Expense, Net \n\nThe following table presents other expense, net (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change Interest income $ 19.6 $ 14.9 $ 4.7 32 % Interest expense (58.6) (50.8) (7.8) 15 % Gain on investments, net 8.8 17.6 (8.8) (50) % Other 1.6 1.5 0.1 7 % Total other expense, net $ (28.6) $ (16.8) $ (11.8) 70 % Percentage of net revenues (0.5) % (0.4) % ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest income primarily includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Interest expense primarily includes interest, net of capitalized interest expense, from long-term debt and customer financing arrangements. Gain on investments, net, primarily includes gains (losses) from the sale of investments in public and privately-held companies, and any observable changes in fair value and impairment charges recorded on these investments. Other typically consists of foreign exchange gains and losses and other non-operational income and expense items. \n\nTotal other expense, net, increased primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt portfolio and lower net gains from equity investments, partially offset by higher interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields. \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\nThe following table presents income tax provision (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 $ Change % Change \n\nIncome tax provision \n\n$ 60.5 $ 57.4 $ 3.1 5 % Effective tax rate 11.3 % 18.5 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the net difference in discrete items in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 and a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 13, Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report. \n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"), all our U.S. and non-U.S. based R&#38;D expenditures are being capitalized and amortized over five and fifteen years, respectively. In 2022, the new regulations resulted in incremental cash tax payments of approximately $140 million and a reduction in our effective tax rate due to increased benefit from U.S. foreign-derived intangible income. In 2023, the new regulations are expected to result in incremental cash tax payments of up to $25 million related to 2022. The actual impact on future cash flow from operations will primarily depend on if and when this legislation is deferred, modified, or repealed by the U.S. Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of R&#38;D expenditures paid or incurred in those respective years. We estimate the largest impact will have been to 2022 cash flow from operations and that the impact in future years should gradually decrease over the five- and fifteen-year amortization periods. The Company&#8217;s future effective tax rate may be impacted. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nLiquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions, investments in strategic relationships, repurchases of shares of our common stock, and payment of cash dividends on our common stock. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, we have repatriated a significant amount of cash from outside of the U.S., and plan to continue to repatriate on an ongoing basis. We intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business, support value-enhancing mergers and acquisitions, and fund our return of capital to stockholders. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, cash generated from operations together with the revolving credit facility and our ability to access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operations; planned stock repurchases and dividends; capital expenditures; purchase commitments and other liquidity requirements; and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth rate; the timing and amount we spend to support development efforts; the expansion of sales and marketing activities; the introduction of new and enhanced products and services; the costs to acquire or invest in businesses and technologies; an increase in manufacturing or component costs; and the risks and uncertainties detailed in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of Item 1A of Part I of this Report. \n\nThe Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. \n\nDebt \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding fixed-rate senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $1,700.0 million (collectively the \"Notes\"), none of which is payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $650.0 million, with $55.4 million payable within 12 months. \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers \n\nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on the Company's business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2022, we had purchase commitments of $2,476.3 million, with $2,101.1 million payable within 12 months. \n\nTax \n\nOur transition tax liability represents future cash payments on accumulated foreign earnings of subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax, net of applicable tax refunds, over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of our transition tax obligation was $250.6 million, with $52.1 million payable within 12 months. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $81.0 million included in long-term income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. \n\nIn 2022, we made tax payments of approximately $253.2 million of which approximately $140 million can be attributed to the capitalization and amortization requirements for R&#38;D expenditures pursuant to the Tax Act. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 to 9 years and 1 to 4 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $177.3 million, with $48.7 million payable within 12 months. \n\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations - Other \n\nUnconditional purchase obligations consist of agreements that include firm and non-cancelable terms to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum amounts or quantities to be purchased at fixed or minimum prices. As of December 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase obligations of $96.8 million, with $48.4 million payable within 12 months. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion of our unconditional purchase obligations. \n\nGuarantees \n\nWe have financial guarantees consisting of third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities, insurance programs, and customs of $27.4 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nCapital Return \n\nIn addition to our cash requirements, we have a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). In January 2018, the Board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. In October 2019, the Board authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program for a total of $3.0 billion. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $32.32 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $299.7 million, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, there was $0.6 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. \n\nFuture share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. Our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program may be discontinued at any time. See Note 10, Equity , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion of our share purchase program. \n\nIn addition, any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof. See Note 16, Subsequent Events , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to December 31, 2022. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest Income Risk - Available-for-Sale Fixed Income Securities \n\nThe primary objectives of our investment activities are, in order of priority, to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and maximize yield. The value of our investments is subject to market price volatility. To minimize this risk, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities, which includes asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, foreign government debt securities, time deposits, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. government securities. At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. \n\nThe following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of our available-for-sale fixed income securities held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points, or BPS, 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; - 150 BPS - 100 BPS - 50 BPS Fair Value \n\nas of \n\nDecember 31, \n\n+ 50 BPS \n\n+ 100 BPS \n\n+ 150 BPS \n\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities \n\n$ 415.8 $ 414.8 $ 413.8 $ 412.8 $ 411.8 $ 410.8 $ 409.8 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; - 150 BPS - 100 BPS - 50 BPS Fair Value \n\nas of \n\nDecember 31, \n\n+ 50 BPS \n\n+ 100 BPS \n\n+ 150 BPS \n\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities \n\n$ 820.2 $ 816.7 $ 813.5 $ 810.1 $ 806.7 $ 803.4 $ 800.1 ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest rate swaps \n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), resulting in a net increase or decrease in interest expense. These swaps hedge against the interest rate risk exposures of the designated debt issuances. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $600.0 million . As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the interest rate swaps resulted in a liability of $87.4 million. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the interest rate swaps resulted in an asset of $2.1 million and a liability of $2.5 million. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rates as of December 31, 2022 would not have had a material impact to our operating results or the fair value of the interest rate swaps. \n\nInterest Rate Locks \n\nThe Company uses interest rate locks, which hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our future debt issuance. We record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the anticipated refinancing. Upon refinancing of our debt and termination of the derivative instruments, the fair value of these interest rate locks will be amortized over the term of our new debt to interest expense. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate locks was $650.0 million . As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of these contracts resulted in an asset of $125.4 million and $45.0 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rates as of December 31, 2022 would not have had a material impact to the fair value of the interest rate locks. \n\nForeign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts \n\nPeriodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months . \n\n&#160; \n\nOur sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Euro, and the Indian Rupee. Approximately 79% of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and/or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non-U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense and costs. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of thirty-six months or less. The change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to prior periods resulted in a reduction to our operating expenses including cost of service revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, by $69.4 million, or 1.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an increase by $28.2 million, or 0.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 5, Derivative Instruments , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for further discussion of our derivative and hedging activity. \n\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the amount of non-U.S. Dollar cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities arising from a hypothetical 10% movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect on December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would change the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and investments we would report in U.S. Dollars as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 by $32.3 million, or 2.6%, and by $37.0 million, or 2.2%, respectively. \n\nEquity Price Risk \n\nWe have also invested in privately-held companies. Depending on the nature of these investments, some can be carried at cost, adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment, and others can be carried at fair value. The carrying values of our investments in privately-held companies were $226.6 million and $197.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The privately-held companies in which we invest can still be considered to be in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages, and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. \n\n"

Subsequent Events \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of this critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nIdentification of distinct performance obligations in revenue contracts \n\n##TABLE_START Description of the matter As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s contracts with customers sometimes contain multiple performance obligations, which are accounted for separately if they are distinct. In such cases, the transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis and revenue is recognized when control of the distinct performance obligation is transferred. For example, product revenue is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, and support revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. \n\nAuditing the Company&#8217;s revenue recognition was challenging, specifically related to identifying and determining the distinct performance obligations and the associated timing of revenue recognition. For example, there were nonstandard terms and conditions that required judgment to determine the distinct performance obligations and the impact on the timing of revenue recognition. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company&#8217;s revenue recognition process, including controls to identify and determine the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. \n\nAmong the procedures we performed to test the identification and determination of the distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition, we read the executed contract and purchase order to understand the contract, identified the performance obligation(s), determined the distinct performance obligations, and evaluated the timing and amount of revenue recognized for a sample of individual sales transactions. We evaluated the accuracy of the Company&#8217;s contract summary documentation, specifically related to the identification and determination of distinct performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1996. \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nFebruary 10, 2023 \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Juniper Networks, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Juniper Networks, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38;

Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies \n\nDescription of Business \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Juniper&#8221;) designs, develops, and sells products and services for high-performance networks, to enable customers to build scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility and improved operating efficiency through automation. Juniper challenges the inherent complexity that comes with networking in the multicloud era. Juniper does this with products, solutions and services that transform the way people connect, work and live. Juniper simplifies the process of transitioning to a secure and automated multicloud environment to enable secure, AI-driven networks that connect the world. \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, highly liquid investments in money market funds, commercial paper, government securities, certificates of deposits, time deposits, and corporate debt securities, which are readily convertible into cash. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from Juniper's purchase date are classified as cash equivalents. \n\nInvestments in Available-for-Sale Debt Securities \n\nThe Company's investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and include the Company's fixed income securities and investments in privately-held companies, consisting of debt and redeemable preferred stock securities. \n\nFixed income securities primarily consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. treasury securities, time deposits, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, certificate of deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, and foreign government debt securities. Fixed income securities are initially recorded at cost and periodically adjusted to fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company periodically evaluates these investments to determine if impairment charges are required. The Company determines whether a credit loss exists for available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. When the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost, the amortized cost will be reduced to its fair value and the resulting loss will be recorded in Consolidated Statements of Operations, if it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the impaired security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or we have the intention to sell the security. If neither of these conditions are met, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and review of the issuer's financial statements. If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded through other expense, net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nThe Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are included in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recorded at fair value. In determining the estimated fair value of such securities, the Company utilizes the most recent data available for the investee including known acquisition offers and subsequent funding rounds. The Company periodically evaluates these securities for indicators of impairment, including the inability to recover a portion of or the entire carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain earnings, the reduction in or termination of financial commitment to the investee from other investors, the intention to sell the investment, and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. If the Company determines that the decline in an investment's value indicates credit losses, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nFor all available-for-sale debt securities, unrealized gains and the amount of unrealized loss relating to factors other than credit loss are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nInvestments in Equity Securities \n\nThe Company's investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values consist of money market funds, amounts under the non-qualified compensation plan (\"NQDC\") that are invested in mutual funds, and investments in public companies. These investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values include the Company's investments in privately-held companies consisting of non-redeemable preferred stock and common stock securities. The Company accounts for these securities at cost, adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairments. Fair value of these equity securities is reassessed when the Company identifies observable price changes indicating that an adjustment upward or downward to the carrying value is necessary. Any observable changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as of the date that the observable transaction took place, rather than the current reporting date. In addition, the Company periodically evaluates equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine if impairment charges are required by evaluating whether an event or change in circumstance has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. A qualitative assessment is performed each reporting period to assess whether there are any impairment indicators, including, but not limited to, significant deterioration in the investee's earnings performance; credit rating; asset quality or business prospects; adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment; change in the general market condition of the geographic area or industry; acquisition offers; and the ability to continue as a going concern. If such indicators are present, the Company estimates the fair value of impaired investments and recognizes an impairment loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value. \n\nThe Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have control over the investee, under the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially measured at fair value and subsequently adjusted for any impairment, dividend received, plus or minus the Company's proportionate share of the equity method investee's income or loss. The Company records its interest in the net earnings or loss of its equity method investment along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions, within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depending on the timing of such financial statements of the investee, there may be a lag between the timing of such financial statement and the Company's quarter-end date. For the Company's sole equity method investment as of December 31, 2022, the Company's share of the investee's net earnings or loss is recorded two months in arrears. The Company records an impairment when factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. \n\nFair Value \n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it transacts, and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: \n\nLevel 1 &#8211; Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nLevel 2 &#8211; Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. These inputs are valued using market-based approaches. \n\nLevel 3 &#8211; Inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company&#8217;s assumptions. These inputs, if any, are valued using internal financial models. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward and interest rate contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. \n\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward contracts or options contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, which are carried at fair value with the derivative's gain or loss initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the costs of services or operating expense line item to which the hedged transaction relates. Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities. \n\nThe Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re-measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re-measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Cash flows from such derivatives are classified as operating activities. \n\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). All interest rate swaps will expire within eight years . The change in fair value of the derivative instrument substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged item. These derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item. \n\nThe Company uses interest rate locks, which fix the benchmark interest rates of future debt issuance. The Company records changes in fair value of interest rate locks in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets, in the period of change. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company will start to amortize the accumulated gains or losses included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate lock cash flow hedges to interest expense. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to other income and expense within the income statement. \n\nThe Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, under agreements containing provisions on set-off with certain counterparties, subject to applicable requirements, the Company is allowed to net-settle transactions, with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. The Company is neither required to pledge nor entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative transactions. \n\nInventory \n\nInventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and finished goods, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In addition, the Company purchases and holds inventory to provide adequate component supplies over the life of the underlying products. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. A charge is recorded to cost of product when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established cost basis. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company evaluates classification of leases as either operating or finance at commencement and, as necessary, at modification. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, other accrued liabilities, and \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\noperating lease liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. \n\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or a rate, are expensed as incurred and are not included within the ROU asset and lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments primarily include reimbursements of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance and utilities. The Company's lease terms are the noncancelable period, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. At lease inception, and in subsequent periods as necessary, the Company estimates the lease term based on its assessment of extension and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nThe Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for all underlying classes of assets. In addition, the Company does not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the following assets: \n\n##TABLE_START Estimated Useful Life (years) Computers, equipment, and software 1.5 to 10 \n\nFurniture and fixtures 5 to 7 \n\nBuilding and building improvements 7 to 40 \n\nLand improvements 10 to 40 \n\nLeasehold improvements Lease term, not to exceed 10 years \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLand is not depreciated. Construction-in-process is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nThe purchase price of an acquired entity is allocated to tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets, including in-process research and development (IPR&#38;D) based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain estimates, such as expected future cash flows, which include consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology, discount rates, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. IPR&#38;D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&#38;D project is completed, the IPR&#38;D is reclassed as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life. Acquisition related expenses are recognized separately from business combination and are expensed as incurred. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of acquired businesses from the date of each acquisition. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually on November 1 or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether it is necessary to quantitatively test goodwill for impairment. This initial assessment includes, among others, consideration of macroeconomic conditions and financial performance. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative analysis is performed by determining the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of the discounted cash flow and the market approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \n\nIntangible assets consist of existing technology, customer relationships, and trade name, which are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives of 4 or 5 years. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination related to IPR&#38;D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized into the results of operations but instead are evaluated for impairment. If and when development is complete, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would be amortized as cost of revenues over their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. If the research and development project is abandoned, the acquired IPR&#38;D assets are written off and charged to expense in the period of abandonment. \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, ROU assets, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. An impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value. \n\nWarranty Reserves \n\nThe Company generally offers a one-year warranty or limited life-time warranty on most of its hardware products, and a 90 -day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. Warranty costs are recognized as part of the Company's cost of sales based on associated material costs, logistics costs, labor costs, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material costs are estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Labor, logistics, and overhead costs are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support customer cases within the warranty period. Warranty reserve is reported within other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nContract Manufacturer Liabilities \n\nThe Company establishes a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with its contract manufacturers for carrying charges, quantities in excess of its demand forecasts, or obsolete material charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers to meet the Company&#8217;s demand forecast or customer orders. The demand forecasts are based upon historical trends and analysis from the Company's sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. \n\nLoss Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Management considers the likelihood of loss related to the occurrence of a liability as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations with non-U.S. Dollar functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the stockholders&#8217; equity section as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company remeasures monetary assets and monetary liabilities in non-functional currencies and records the resulting foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below. \n\nIdentify the contract with a customer . The Company generally considers a sales contract and/or agreement with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances. The Company combines contracts with a customer if contracts are negotiated with a single commercial substance or contain price dependencies. \n\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract . Product performance obligations include hardware, software licenses including perpetual and term-based licenses, and service performance obligations including maintenance services, Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\"), education and training, and professional services. \n\nDetermine the transaction price . The transaction price for the Company&#8217;s contracts with its customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration, provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. Fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for rights of return, rebates, and price protection, which are based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria outlined in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. The Company generally invoices customers for hardware, software licenses and related maintenance arrangements at time of delivery, and professional services either upfront or upon meeting certain milestones. Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. The Company&#8217;s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year. \n\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract . For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. SSP is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles. \n\nRecognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation . Revenue for hardware and certain software licenses, are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. Certain software licenses are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the license. Revenue for maintenance services and SaaS is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term. Revenue from education, training, and professional services is recognized as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less. \n\nDeferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to undelivered product commitments and other shipments that have not met revenue recognition criteria. Deferred service revenue represents billed amounts for service contracts, which include technical support, hardware and software maintenance, professional services, SaaS, and education and training, for which services have not been rendered. \n\nRevenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. \n\nDeferred Commissions \n\nSales commissions earned by the Company&#8217;s sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are recorded as prepaid expenses or other long-term assets and are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit which is typically over the term of the customer contracts. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nResearch and Development \n\nCosts to research, design, and develop the Company's products are expensed as incurred. \n\nSoftware Development Costs \n\nCapitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ends when a product is available for general release to customers. Generally, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs incurred between achieving technological feasibility and product general availability have not been significant. \n\nThe Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software systems during the application development stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs incurred in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees, who are directly associated with the development of the applications. \n\nAdvertising \n\nAdvertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Costs to produce advertising were approximately $ 7.4 million for 2022 and 2021 and $ 4.0 million for 2020. Costs to communicate advertising totaled approximately $ 30.0 million, $ 26.6 million, and $ 21.7 million, for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance share awards (\"PSAs\") and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). For service condition only awards, share-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the underlying awards and amortized on a straight-line basis. For PSAs, share-based compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion of the awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. \n\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#8220;BSM&#8221;) option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its ESPP purchase rights. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions that represent management's best estimates of volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield. The Company estimates expected volatility based on the implied volatility of market-traded options, on the Company's common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company&#8217;s ESPP. The expected life of ESPP purchase rights approximates the offering period. \n\nThe Company determines the grant date fair value of its RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs based on the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant, adjusted by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares of common stock during the requisite and derived service period as these awards are not entitled to receive dividends until vested. \n\nFor market-based RSUs, the Company estimates the fair value and derived service period using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model (\"Monte Carlo model\"). The determination of the grant date fair value and derived service periods using the Monte Carlo model is affected by the Company's stock price, comparative market-based returns, as well as various highly subjective assumptions that represent management's best estimates of volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The Company estimates expected volatility based on the implied volatility of market-traded options, on the Company's common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors, including historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock over the contractual life of the Company's market-based RSUs. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. \n\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes. The Company accounts for the current impacts of U.S. tax on certain foreign subsidiaries income, which is referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, in the year earned. \n\nConcentrations of Risk \n\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives, and accounts receivable. The Company invests only in high-quality credit instruments and maintains its cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments in fixed income securities with several high-quality institutions. Deposits held with banks, including those held in foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. We mitigate the concentration of credit risk in our investment portfolio through diversification of the investments in various industries and asset classes, and limits to the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer and credit rating. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company has a risk assessment and mitigation framework to evaluate the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk. As part of this risk mitigation framework, the Company transacts with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and also enters into master netting agreements, which permit net settlement of the transactions with the same counterparty. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. Therefore, the Company does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties. \n\nGenerally, credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across different geographic locations throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues. \n\nThe Company relies on sole suppliers for certain critical components such as application-specific integrated circuits. Additionally, the Company relies primarily on a limited number of significant independent contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers for the production of its products. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could negatively impact future operating results. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers : On January 1, 2022, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2021-08 (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as if the contracts were originated by the acquirer. Upon adoption, the standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nReference Rate Reform : In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 (Topic 848), Reference Rate Reform, which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the existing guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The standard became effective upon issuance and may be applied to any new or amended contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No 2022-06, extending the sunset date of the relief provided \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nunder ASU No. 2020-04 to December 31, 2024. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nNote 2. Divestiture \n\nOn April 4, 2022, Synopsys, Inc (\"Synopsys\") purchased Juniper's silicon photonics business and formed a new entity called OpenLight Photonics, Inc. (\"OpenLight\"). The Company received cash consideration of $ 90.0 million and retained a 25 % equity interest in the new entity. The agreements with Synopsys contain redemption options with respect to Juniper's equity interest in OpenLight, which are exercisable either by (i) Juniper on or after the third anniversary of the acquisition or sooner in certain circumstances, or (ii) Synopsys on or after the third anniversary of the acquisition. Juniper can exercise its put option at the greater of fair value at the time of redemption or $ 30.0 million, and the option was assigned a value of $ 10.8 million . The divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results, and therefore, did not qualify as a discontinued operation. \n\nThe Company recognized a gain on divestiture of $ 45.8 million and the portion of gain related to the remeasurement of retained investment was $ 19.5 million. The following table presents the carrying value of the major components of assets and liabilities derecognized as of April 4, 2022 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START As of April 4, 2022 Assets: Total current assets $ 1.0 &#160; Property and equipment, net 3.6 &#160; Deferred tax assets 3.9 &#160; Other long-term assets 1.1 &#160; Purchased intangible assets, net 49.0 &#160; Goodwill 28.9 &#160; Total assets held for sale $ 87.5 &#160; Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 1.4 &#160; Other liabilities 1.1 &#160; Total liabilities held for sale $ 2.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company's 25 % equity interest in OpenLight is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The investment was recognized at fair value in other long-term assets within the consolidated balance sheet at an aggregate amount of $ 40.8 million. The fair value was determined based on the price paid by Synopsys for its 75 % equity interest in OpenLight along with the value of the redemption options. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nNote 3.

The gross unrealized losses related to these investments were primarily due to changes in market interest rates. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such available-for-sale debt securities and has determined tha t no allowance for credit losses was required to be recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2020, the Company had no material gross realized gains or losses from available-for-sale debt securities.

The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of these assets. The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value. \n\nThe Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities on a recurring basis using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent valuations at the time of financing activities and the investee's capital structure. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had no material realized gains or losses from the disposal of securities related to privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \n\nThe Company's investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair value are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of equity securities without readily determinable fair value and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, on a nonrecurring basis using an analysis of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including recent financing activities and the investee's capital structure. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there have been no material upward or downward adjustments for price changes to the equity securities without readily determinable fair value. \n\nCertain of the Company's assets, including intangible assets and goodwill, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. There were no significant impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \n\nAssets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value \n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company's total outstanding debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 1,485.6 million and $ 1,845.6 million, respectively, based on observable market inputs (Level 2). \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nNote 5.

As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the potential effects of set-off associated with the derivative contracts would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities b y $ 73.8 million and $ 17.5 million , respectively. \n\nDesignated Derivatives \n\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward contracts or options contracts to hedge the Company's planned cost of revenues and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and typically have maturities of thirty-six months or less. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps, designated as fair value hedges, to convert the fixed interest rates of certain Senior Notes (\"Notes\") to floating interest rates. In April 2021, the Company entered into swaps for an aggregate notional amount of $ 300.0 million for its fixed-rate Notes maturing in December 2030 in addition to the swaps entered in 2019 for an aggregate notional amount of $ 300.0 million for its fixed-rate Notes maturing in March 2041. The interest rate swaps will expire within eight years . \n\nIn 2020, the Company entered into interest rate locks with large financial institutions, which fix the benchmark interest rates of future debt issuances for an aggregate notional amount of $ 650.0 million. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are expected to terminate within three years . \n\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations \n\nFor cash flow hedges, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $ 33.1 million , unrealized loss of $ 9.1 million and unrealized gain of $ 63.5 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the effective portion of its derivative instruments during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nFor foreign currency contracts, the Company reclassified a loss of $ 25.8 million, a gain of $ 28.9 million and a loss of $ 9.0 million out of accumulated other comprehensive loss to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, an estimated &#160;$ 31.7 million of unrealized net loss within accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. \n\nNon-Designated Derivatives \n\nThe Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months . The outstanding non-designated derivative instruments are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which were recorded in Other expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not material during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nSee Note 1, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, for the Company&#8217;s policy regarding the offsetting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nNote 6.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, accretion of the discount, and amortization of issuance costs. The indenture and supplemental indentures (together, the \"indentures\") that govern the Notes also contain various covenants, including limitations on the Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions over certain dollar thresholds. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the indentures governing the Notes. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nRevolving Credit Facility \n\nIn April 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $ 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $ 200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval. Proceeds of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used by the Company for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in April 2024. \n\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin of between 0.000 % and 0.375 %, depending on the Company's public debt rating or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, plus a margin of between 0.910 % and 1.375 %, depending on the Company's public debt rating. Base rate is defined as the greatest of (A) Citibank's base rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.500 % or (C) the ICE Benchmark Administration Settlement Rate applicable to dollars for a period of one month plus 1.00 %. The Eurocurrency rate is determined for U.S. dollars and Pounds Sterling as the rate at which deposits in such currency are offered in the London interbank market for the applicable interest period and for Euro as the rate specified for deposits in Euro with a maturity comparable to the applicable interest period. \n\nOn December 17, 2021, an amendment to the Credit Agreement was executed that defines the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the benchmark rate for U.S. dollar borrowings in the absence of LIBOR, and the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) as the benchmark rate for Pounds Sterling borrowings following the cessation of GBP LIBOR on December 31, 2021. \n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0 x (provided that if a material acquisition has been consummated, the Company is permitted to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.5 x for up to four quarters) and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0 x during the term of the credit facility. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement. \n\nFinancing Arrangements \n\nThe Company provides certain customers with access to extended financing arrangements that allow for longer payment terms than those typically provided by the Company by factoring accounts receivable to third-party financing providers (\"financing providers\"). The program does not and is not intended to affect the timing of the Company's revenue recognition. Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing providers are due to the Company within 1 to 90 days from the sale of the receivable. In these transactions with the financing providers, the Company surrenders control over the transferred assets. \n\nPursuant to the financing arrangements for the sale of receivables, the Company sold receivables of $ 50.6 million, $ 31.9 million and $ 57.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company received cash proceeds from financing providers of $ 41.5 million, $ 32.5 million, and $ 57.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the amounts owed by the financing providers were $ 11.8 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively, which were recorded in accounts receivable on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nNote 10.

See Note 16, Subsequent Events, for a discussion of the Company's stock repurchase activity subsequent to December 31, 2022. \n\nFuture share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. \n\nIn addition to repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company withholds shares of common stock from certain employees in connection with the vesting of stock awards issued to such employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements. Such withheld shares are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. Repurchases associated with tax withholdings were $ 15.4 million, $ 10.2 million, and $ 6.2 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax \n\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Unrealized \n\nGains/Losses \n\non Available-for- \n\nSale Debt Securities (1) \n\nUnrealized \n\nGains/Losses \n\non Cash Flow \n\nHedges (2) \n\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments Total Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 29.7 &#160; $ ( 4.3 ) $ ( 43.9 ) $ ( 18.5 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 5.7 &#160; 54.4 &#160; 7.7 &#160; 67.8 &#160; Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \n\n( 1.3 ) 7.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6.3 &#160; Other comprehensive income, net 4.4 &#160; 62.0 &#160; 7.7 &#160; 74.1 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 34.1 &#160; $ 57.7 &#160; $ ( 36.2 ) $ 55.6 &#160; Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 5.0 ) ( 13.5 ) ( 12.8 ) ( 31.3 ) Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \n\n( 1.2 ) ( 25.2 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 26.4 ) Other comprehensive loss, net ( 6.2 ) ( 38.7 ) ( 12.8 ) ( 57.7 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 27.9 &#160; $ 19.0 &#160; $ ( 49.0 ) $ ( 2.1 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 6.5 ) 15.7 &#160; ( 30.1 ) ( 20.9 ) Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 0.4 &#160; 26.8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 27.2 &#160; Other comprehensive (loss) income, net ( 6.1 ) 42.5 &#160; ( 30.1 ) 6.3 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 21.8 &#160; $ 61.5 &#160; $ ( 79.1 ) $ 4.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n________________________________ \n\n(1) The reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 , and 2020 for realized gains on available-for-sale debt securities were not material, and were included in other expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\n(2) The reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for realized gains and losses on cash flow hedges was $ 25.8 million, $ 28.9 million and $( 8.9 ) million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans \n\nEquity Incentive Plans \n\nThe Company&#8217;s equity incentive plans include the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2015 Plan&#8221;) and the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#8220;ESPP&#8221;). The Company has granted RSUs and PSAs under the 2015 Plan and purchase rights under the ESPP. In addition, in connection with certain past acquisitions, the Company has assumed or substituted stock options, RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs granted under the stock plans of the acquired companies. Such awards were converted into or replaced with the Company's stock options, RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs, respectively. \n\nThe 2015 Plan was adopted and approved by the Company's stockholders in May 2015 and had an initial authorized share reserve of 38.0 million shares of common stock, plus the addition of any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Plan that were outstanding as of May 19, 2015, and that subsequently expire or otherwise terminate, up to a maximum of an additional 29.0 million shares. In May 2017, the Company's stockholders approved an additional 23.0 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, and in May 2019, the Company's stockholders approved an additional 3.7 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 16.6 million shares were subject to outstanding equity awards and 3.4 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan. \n\nThe ESPP was adopted and approved by the Company's stockholders in May 2008. In May 2020, the Company's stockholders approved an additional 8.0 million shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. To date, the Company's stockholders have approved a share reserve of 43.0 million shares of the Company's common stock for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to acquire shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at a 15 % discount (as determined in the ESPP) through periodic payroll deductions of up to 10 % of base compensation, subject to individual purchase limits of 6,000 shares in any twelve-month period or $ 25,000 worth of stock, determined at the fair market value of the shares at the time the stock purchase option is granted, in one calendar year. The ESPP provides 24 month offering periods with four 6 -month purchase periods. A new 24 -month offering period will commence every six months thereafter. The purchase price for the Company&#8217;s common stock under the ESPP is 85 % of the lower of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of the applicable offering period or (2) the end of each 6 -month purchase period during such offering period.

Until vested, RSUs and PSAs do not have the voting and dividend participation rights of common stock and the shares underlying the awards are not considered issued and outstanding. \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s RSU, RSA, and PSA activity and related information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in millions, except per share amounts and years): \n\n##TABLE_START Outstanding RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (In Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value \n\nBalance at December 31, 2021 \n\n22.2 &#160; $ 24.55 &#160; Granted (1)(2) \n\n9.4 &#160; 29.62 &#160; Vested (3) \n\n( 8.3 ) 24.44 &#160; Canceled ( 3.1 ) 25.76 &#160; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2022 \n\n20.2 &#160; $ 26.78 &#160; 1.2 $ 646.6 &#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 \n\nVested and expected-to-vest RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs 16.6 &#160; $ 27.28 &#160; 1.2 $ 531.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n________________________________ \n\n(1) Includes 7.8 million service-based, 1.2 million performance-based, and 0.4 million market-based awards. The number of shares subject to performance-based and market-based conditions represents the aggregate maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the award over its full term. The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSAs was reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares of common stock during the requisite and derived service period as these awards are not entitled to receive dividends until vested. \n\n(2) The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs granted and assumed or substituted during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 29.62 , $ 26.21 , and $ 21.59 , respectively. The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSAs was reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares of common stock during the requisite and derived service period as these awards are not entitled to receive dividends until vested. During 2022, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.21 per share of common stock on January 27, 2022, April 26, 2022, July 26, 2022, and October 25, 2022. \n\n(3) Total fair value of RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 202.2 million, $ 184.2 million, and $ 174.7 million, respectively. \n\nShares Available for Grant \n\nThe following table presents the stock activity and the total number of shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Shares \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 \n\n5.1 &#160; Additional shares authorized 4.5 &#160; Options, RSUs, and PSAs granted (*) \n\n( 9.0 ) RSUs and PSAs canceled (*) \n\n2.8 &#160; \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 \n\n3.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n________________________________ \n\n(*) In May 2019, the 2015 Plan was amended, and the amendment removed the fungible share adjustment used to determine shares available for issuance. Under the original terms of the 2015 Plan, RSUs and PSAs with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the day of the grant were counted against shares authorized under the plan as two and one-tenth shares of common stock (\"the prior fungible rate\") for each share subject to such award. Pursuant to the amendment, beginning on May 14, 2019, each share award granted under the 2015 Plan reduces the share reserve by one share and all share awards granted on May 14, 2019, and thereafter that are later forfeited, canceled or terminated are returned to the share reserve in the same manner. During 2022, among the total 2.8 million of canceled shares, 0.9 million shares represent the shares returned to the share reserve at the prior fungible rate. The number of shares subject to PSAs granted represents the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the award over its full term. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \n\nDuring 2022, 2021, and 2020, employees purchased 2.6 million, 2.8 million, and 2.7 million shares of common stock through the ESPP at an average exercise price of $ 21.59 , $ 19.81 , and $ 19.59 per share, respectively. \n\nValuation Assumptions \n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used and the resulting estimates of fair value for ESPP purchase rights and market-based RSUs were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 ESPP Purchase Rights: Volatility 29 % 32 % 31 % Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 0.1 % 0.8 % Expected life (years) 1.3 1.3 1.3 Dividend yield 2.5 % 3.0 % 3.3 % Weighted-average fair value per share $ 8.84 $ 6.96 $ 6.34 Market-based RSUs: Volatility 30 % 30 % 25 % Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 0.2 % 1.3 % Dividend yield 2.5 % 3.4 % 3.3 % Weighted-average fair value per share $ 47.96 $ 30.70 $ 26.32 ##TABLE_END\n\nShare-Based Compensation Expense \n\nShare-based compensation expense associated with stock options, RSUs, RSAs, PSAs, and ESPP purchase rights was recorded in the following cost and expense categories in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cost of revenues - Product $ 5.9 &#160; $ 5.3 &#160; $ 5.4 &#160; Cost of revenues - Service 17.4 &#160; 18.2 &#160; 15.8 &#160; Research and development 84.0 &#160; 93.1 &#160; 78.8 &#160; Sales and marketing 59.1 &#160; 65.9 &#160; 58.2 &#160; General and administrative 42.9 &#160; 40.1 &#160; 31.4 &#160; Total $ 209.3 &#160; $ 222.6 &#160; $ 189.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense by award type (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Stock options $ 5.4 &#160; $ 9.3 &#160; $ 7.3 &#160; RSUs, RSAs, and PSAs 181.9 &#160; 196.2 &#160; 162.6 &#160; ESPP Purchase Rights 22.0 &#160; 17.1 &#160; 19.7 &#160; Total $ 209.3 &#160; $ 222.6 &#160; $ 189.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense, which are reflected in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $ 25.7 million, $ 28.2 million, and $ 23.5 million, respectively. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the realized tax benefit related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $ 38.6 million, $ 31.7 million, and $ 21.7 million, respectively.

Significant components of the Company's long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; As of December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: &#160; &#160; Net operating loss carry-forwards $ 57.2 &#160; $ 72.5 &#160; Research and other credit carry-forwards 281.3 &#160; 272.2 &#160; Deferred revenue 58.1 &#160; 47.7 &#160; Share-based compensation 17.2 &#160; 17.9 &#160; Capitalized R&#38;D expenditure \n\n293.1 &#160; 102.0 &#160; Reserves and accruals not currently deductible 66.1 &#160; 61.0 &#160; Operating lease liabilities 39.7 &#160; 45.4 &#160; Other 13.2 &#160; 9.9 &#160; Total deferred tax assets 825.9 &#160; 628.6 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 310.9 ) ( 300.9 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 515.0 &#160; 327.7 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment basis differences &#8212; &#160; ( 1.3 ) Purchased intangible assets ( 32.3 ) ( 56.5 ) Unremitted foreign earnings ( 23.7 ) ( 25.5 ) Net unrealized gain ( 35.8 ) ( 21.0 ) Operating lease assets ( 36.1 ) ( 39.9 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 127.9 ) ( 144.2 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 387.1 &#160; $ 183.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a valuation allowance on its U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets of $ 310.9 million and $ 300.9 million, respectively. The balance at December 31, 2022 consisted of $ 1.7 million, $ 297.8 million, and $ 11.5 million against the Company's U.S. federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, which the Company believes are not more likely than not to be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance increased in 2022 and 2021 by $ 10 million and $ 39.4 million, respectively, primarily related to the changes in state R&#38;D tax credits. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal, California and other states net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $ 150.0 million, $ 129.1 million, and $ 138.8 million, respectively. The California net operating loss carry-forwards of $ 129.1 million are expected to expire unused. The Company also had federal, California, and other state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $ 2.4 million, $ 308.6 million, and $ 34.2 million, respectively. Unused net operating loss and other state tax credit carry-forwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year 2023. The California tax credit carry-forwards will carry forward indefinitely. \n\nThe Company provides deferred tax liabilities for all tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to subsidiaries' parent unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. The Company has made no provision for deferred taxes on approximately $ 118.1 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2022. These earnings are considered indefinitely invested in operations of the subsidiaries, as the Company intends to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of its operations. If these earnings were distributed to the parent, the Company would be subject to additional taxes of approximately $ 23.9 million. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 116.0 million, $ 113.4 million, and $ 116.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 111.7 million of the $ 116.0 million gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate before considering valuation allowance. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 113.4 &#160; $ 116.0 &#160; $ 151.3 &#160; Tax positions related to current year: Additions 5.8 &#160; 7.7 &#160; 5.3 &#160; Tax positions related to prior years: Additions 6.9 &#160; 3.3 &#160; 18.1 &#160; Reductions ( 2.5 ) ( 3.6 ) ( 52.0 ) Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 9.4 ) ( 1.8 ) Lapses in statutes of limitations ( 7.6 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 4.9 ) Balance at end of year $ 116.0 &#160; $ 113.4 &#160; $ 116.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $ 5.6 million, $ 8.1 million, and $ 5.3 million, respectively, as other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the changes in the level of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the Company recognized a (benefit), or expense, for net interest and penalties of $( 2.5 ) million, $ 2.7 million, and $( 20.7 ) million in its Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. \n\nThe Company engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. There is a greater than remote likelihood that the balance of the gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $ 1.0 million within the next twelve months due to the completion of tax review cycles in various tax jurisdictions and lapses of applicable statutes of limitation. \n\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, Juniper Networks or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such jurisdictions as the Netherlands, U.K., France, Germany, Japan, China, Australia, India, and the U.S. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012. \n\nThe Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the India tax authorities for the 2017 through 2018 tax years and the 2012 through 2020 tax years, respectively. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes the resolution of the audits is unlikely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. \n\nThe Company is pursuing all available administrative remedies relative to ongoing matters. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations; however, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of these matters could have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nNote 14.

For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the following tables were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers \n\nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements. A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust its requirements based on the Company's business needs prior to firm orders being placed. The following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s purchase commitments as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ending December 31, Purchase Commitments 2023 $ 2,101.1 &#160; 2024 134.9 &#160; 2025 75.3 &#160; 2026 80.0 &#160; 2027 85.0 &#160; Total $ 2,476.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company establishes a liability in connection with purchase commitments related to quantities in excess of its demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on the Company&#8217;s demand forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $ 21.5 million based on its estimate of such charges. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s unconditional purchase obligations other than with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ending December 31, Unconditional Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 48.4 &#160; 2024 36.3 &#160; 2025 9.7 &#160; 2026 2.0 &#160; 2027 0.4 &#160; Total $ 96.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn December 2018, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement and certain Statements of Work, as subsequently amended (collectively, the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;), with International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects to pay IBM $ 94.2 million over the remaining initial term of the Agreement. The table above does not include fees payable to IBM under the contract as the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of the payments related to each of the years under this contract due to uncertainties in the usage of the services. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that have remaining lease terms of 1 to 9 years and 1 to 4 years, respectively. Each leased facility is subject to an individual lease or sublease, which could provide various options to extend or terminate the lease agreement. Facilities are primarily comprised of corporate offices, data centers, and R&#38;D facilities. Equipment includes vehicles and various office equipment. The Company also has variable lease payments that are primarily comprised of common area maintenance and utility charges. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. \n\nThe components of lease costs and other information related to leases were as follows (in millions, except years and percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 48.4 &#160; $ 57.4 &#160; Variable lease cost 10.0 &#160; 11.5 &#160; Total lease cost $ 58.4 &#160; $ 68.9 &#160; Operating cash outflows from operating leases $ 53.1 &#160; $ 57.8 &#160; ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 26.0 &#160; $ 29.7 &#160; As of December 31, 2022 2021 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 4.1 4.6 Weighted average discount rate 3.5 &#160; % 3.3 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, future operating lease payments for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ending December 31, Amount 2023 $ 48.7 &#160; 2024 48.3 &#160; 2025 39.3 &#160; 2026 18.5 &#160; 2027 11.2 &#160; Thereafter 11.3 &#160; Total lease payments 177.3 &#160; Less: interest ( 12.2 ) Total $ 165.1 &#160; Balance Sheet Information Other accrued liabilities $ 47.4 &#160; Long-term operating lease liabilities 117.7 &#160; Total (*) \n\n$ 165.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n________________________________ \n\n(*) Total lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 above excluded $ 83.9 million in legally binding lease payments for a lease signed but not yet commenced. \n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \n\nDebt and Interest Payment on Debt \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company held total outstanding debt consisting of the Notes with a carrying value of $ 1,601.3 million. See Note 9, Debt and Financing , for further discussion of the Company's long-term debt and expected future principal maturities. \n\nTax Liability \n\nOur transition tax liability represents future cash payments on accumulated foreign earnings of subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"). The Company has elected to pay its transition tax, net of applicable tax refunds, over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. The remaining balance of the Company's transition tax obligation was $ 250.6 million, of which $ 198.4 million remains in long-term income taxes payable as of December 31, 2022. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company also had $ 81.0 million included in long-term income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. \n\nGuarantees \n\nThe Company enters into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that the Company&#8217;s products solely, or in combination with other third-party products, infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.7 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively, for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company also has financial guarantees consisting of third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities, insurance programs and customs of $ 27.4 million and $ 2.4 million, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nThe Company is involved in investigations, disputes, litigation, and legal proceedings. The Company records an accrual for loss contingencies for legal proceedings when it believes that an unfavorable outcome is both (a) probable and (b) the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable. The Company intends to aggressively defend itself in these matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that these existing claims or proceedings are not likely, individually and in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these matters or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to adjust the liability and record additional expenses. \n\nNote 16. Subsequent Events \n\nDividend Declaration \n\nOn January 31, 2023, the Company announced a cash dividend of $ 0.22 per share of common stock to be paid on March 22, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2023. \n\nStock Repurchase Activities \n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, through the date of filing of this Report (the \"filing date\"), the Company repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock in the open market, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 63.0 million at an average price of $ 30.98 per share, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Repurchases of approximately 1.4 million shares were settled prior to the filing of this Report and the remaining shares will be settled after the filing date. The Company has an aggregate of $ 0.5 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program as of the filing date. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nAttached as exhibits to this Report are certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). This &#8220;Controls and Procedures&#8221; section includes information concerning the controls and related evaluations referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. \n\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any significant impact to our internal controls over financial reporting due to the office/hybrid collaboration model as the design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with secure accessibility to our data. \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework as published in 2013 . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its internal control over financial reporting was effective. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our Consolidated Financial Statements, as stated in their \n\nreport included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\n"
