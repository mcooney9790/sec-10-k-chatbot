BUSINESS \n\nOUR BUSINESSES \n\nOverview \n\nThe terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;its,&#8221; &#8220;UnitedHealth Group,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; used in this report refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries. \n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms &#8212; Optum and UnitedHealthcare &#8212; are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. \n\nThe ability to analyze complex data and apply deep health care expertise and insights allows us to serve people, care providers, businesses, communities and governments with more innovative products and complete, end-to-end offerings for many of the biggest challenges facing health care today. \n\nOptum combines clinical expertise, technology and data to empower people, partners and providers with the guidance and tools they need to achieve better health. Optum serves the broad health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers, through its Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx businesses. These businesses improve overall health system performance by optimizing care quality and delivery, reducing costs and improving consumer and provider experience, leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, pharmacy care services, health care operations, population health and health care delivery. \n\nUnitedHealthcare offers a full range of health benefits, enabling affordable coverage, simplifying the health care experience and delivering access to high-quality care. UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual serves employers ranging from sole proprietorships to large, multi-site and national employers, public sector employers and individual consumers. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement delivers health and well-being benefits for Medicare beneficiaries and retirees. UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State manages health care benefit programs on behalf of state Medicaid and community programs and their participants. \n\nWe have four reportable segments: \n\n&#8226; Optum Health; \n\n&#8226; Optum Insight; \n\n&#8226; Optum Rx; and \n\n&#8226; UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State. \n\nOptum \n\nOptum is an information and technology-enabled health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including: \n\n&#8226; Those who need care: consumers who need the right care, information, resources, products and engagement to improve their health, achieve their health goals and receive an improved patient experience that is personalized and holistic and delivered in all care settings, including in-home and virtually. \n\n&#8226; Those who provide care: pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other health care facilities seeking to improve the health system and reduce the administrative burden allowing for providers to focus time on patients leading to the best possible patient care and experiences while achieving better health outcomes at lower costs. Improved health outcomes are achieved by leveraging our clinical expertise, data and analytics to better predict, prevent and intercept consumers&#8217; health conditions and ensure they receive the best evidence-based care. \n\n&#8226; Those who pay for care: employers; health plans; and state, federal and municipal agencies devoted to ensuring the people they sponsor receive high-quality care, administered and delivered efficiently and effectively, all while driving health equity so that every individual, family and community has access to the care they need. \n\n&#8226; Those who innovate for care: global life sciences organizations dedicated to developing more effective approaches to care, enabling technologies and medicines to improve care delivery and health outcomes. \n\nOptum operates three business segments leveraging distinctive capabilities in health care delivery, population health, health care operations, data and analytics and pharmacy care services: \n\n&#8226; Optum Health delivers care, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services; \n\n&#8226; Optum Insight offers data, analytics, research, consulting, technology and managed services solutions; and \n\n&#8226; Optum Rx provides diversified pharmacy care services. \n\nOptum Health \n\nOptum Health provides comprehensive and patient-centered care, addressing the physical, mental, social, and financial well-being of 102 million consumers and serves more than 100 health payer partners. We engage people in the most appropriate care settings, including clinical sites, in-home and virtual. Optum Health delivers primary, multi-specialty, behavioral, surgical and urgent care; helps patients and providers navigate and address complex, chronic and behavioral health needs; offers post-acute care planning services; and serves consumers and care providers through advanced, on-demand digital health technologies, such as telehealth and remote patient monitoring, and innovative health care financial services. Optum Health works directly with consumers, care delivery systems, providers, employers, payers, and public-sector entities to provide high quality, accessible and equitable care with improved health outcomes and reduced total cost of care. \n\nOptum Health enables care providers to transition from traditional fee-for-service payment models to performance-based delivery and payment models designed to improve patient health outcomes and experience through value-based care. Through strategic partnerships, alliances and ownership arrangements, Optum Health helps care providers adopt new approaches and technologies improving the coordination of care across providers to serve patients more comprehensively. \n\nOptum Health offerings include fully accountable value-based arrangements, where Optum Health assumes responsibility for health care costs in exchange for a monthly premium. Offerings also include administrative fee arrangements, where Optum Health manages or administers products and services in exchange for a monthly fee, and fee-for-service arrangements, where Optum Health delivers health-related products and medical services for patients at a contracted fee. \n\nOptum Financial, including Optum Bank, serves consumers through nearly 20 million consumer accounts with nearly $20 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2022. Organizations across the health system rely on Optum Financial to manage and improve payment flows through its highly automated, scalable, end-to-end digital payment systems and integrated card solutions. For financial services offerings, Optum Financial charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. \n\nOptum Health sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in three key areas: employers, including large, mid-sized and small employers; payers including health plans, third-party administrators (TPAs), underwriter/stop-loss carriers and individual product intermediaries; and public entities including the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Veterans Affairs, Defense, and other federal, state and local health care agencies. \n\nOptum Insight \n\nOptum Insight connects the health care system with services, analytics and platforms that make clinical, administrative and financial processes simpler and more efficient for all participants in the health care system. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, public entities, life sciences companies and other organizations comprising the health care industry depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance and reduce costs through administrative efficiency and payment simplification, advance care quality through evidence-based standards built directly into clinical workflows, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. \n\nHealth Systems.

Serves health plans by improving financial performance and enhancing outcomes through proactive analytics, a comprehensive payment integrity portfolio and technology-enabled and staff-supported risk and quality services. Optum Insight helps health plans navigate a dynamic environment defined by shifts in employer vs. public-sector coverage, the demand for affordable benefit plans and the need to leverage new technology to reduce complexity. \n\nState Governments. Provides advanced technology and analytics services to modernize the administration of critical safety net programs, such as Medicaid, while improving cost predictability. \n\nLife Sciences Companies. Combines data and analytics expertise with comprehensive technologies and health care knowledge to help life sciences companies, including those in pharmaceuticals and medical technology, adopt a more comprehensive approach to advancing therapeutic discoveries and improving clinical outcomes. \n\nMany of Optum Insight&#8217;s software and information products and professional services are delivered over extended periods, often several years. Optum Insight maintains an order backlog to track unearned revenues under these long-term arrangements. The backlog consists of estimated revenue from signed contracts, other legally binding agreements and anticipated contract renewals based on historical experience with Optum Insight&#8217;s customers. Optum Insight&#8217;s aggregate backlog as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $30.0 billion, of which $16.8 billion is expected to be realized within the next 12 months. The aggregate backlog includes $10.7 billion related to affiliated agreements. Optum Insight&#8217;s aggregate backlog as of December 31, 2021, was $22.4 billion, including $8.9 billion related to affiliated agreements. \n\nOptum Insight&#8217;s products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. Optum Insight&#8217;s products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface Optum Insight&#8217;s products with their applications. \n\nOptum Rx \n\nOptum Rx provides a full spectrum of pharmacy care services through its network of more than 67,000 retail pharmacies, through home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies, the provision of in-home and community-based infusion services and through rare disease and gene therapy support services. It also offers direct-to-consumer solutions. \n\nOptum Rx manages a broad range of prescription drug spend, including widely available retail drugs as well as limited and ultra-limited distribution drugs in oncology, HIV, pain management and ophthalmology. Optum Rx serves the growing pharmacy needs of people with behavioral health and substance use disorders. In 2022, Optum Rx managed $124 billion in pharmaceutical spending, including $52 billion in specialty pharmaceutical spending. \n\nOptum Rx serves health benefits providers, large national employer plans, unions and trusts, purchasing coalitions and public-sector entities. Optum Rx sells its services through direct sales, health insurance brokers and other health care consultants. \n\nOptum Rx offers multiple clinical programs, digital tools and services to help clients manage overall pharmacy and health care costs in a clinically appropriate manner which are designed to deliver improved consumer experiences, better health outcomes and a lower total cost of care. Optum Rx provides various utilization management, medication management, quality assurance, adherence and counseling programs to complement each client&#8217;s plan design and clinical strategies. Optum Rx is accelerating the integration of medical, pharmacy and behavioral care and treating the whole patient by embedding our pharmacists as key members of the patient care team. \n\nUnitedHealthcare \n\nThrough its health benefits offerings, UnitedHealthcare is enabling better health, creating a better health care experience for its customers and helping to control rising health care costs. UnitedHealthcare&#8217;s market position is built on: \n\n&#8226; strong local-market relationships; \n\n&#8226; the breadth of product offerings, based upon extensive expertise in distinct market segments in health care; \n\n&#8226; service and advanced technology, including digital consumer engagement; \n\n&#8226; competitive medical and operating cost positions; \n\n&#8226; effective clinical engagement; and \n\n&#8226; innovation for customers and consumers. \n\nUnitedHealthcare uses Optum&#8217;s capabilities to help coordinate and provide patient care, improve affordability of medical care, analyze cost trends, manage pharmacy care services, work with care providers more effectively and create a simpler and more satisfying consumer and physician experience. \n\nIn the United States, UnitedHealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through networks which, as of December 31, 2022, include 1.7 million physicians and other health care professionals and 6,400 hospitals and other facilities. \n\nUnitedHealthcare is subject to extensive government regulation. See further discussion of our regulatory environment below under &#8220;Government Regulation&#8221; and in Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; \n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual \n\nDomestically, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for large national employers, public sector employers, mid-sized employers, small businesses, and individuals. As of December 31, 2022, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual provides access to medical services for 26.7 million people. Globally, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual serves nearly 7.7 million people with medical and dental benefits, typically \n\nin exchange for a monthly premium per member, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, but also in more than 150 other countries. UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual offers health care delivery in our principal global markets through nearly 45 hospitals, and more than 200 outpatient and ambulatory clinics and surgery centers to UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual global members and consumers served by other payers. \n\nThrough its risk-based product offerings, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium which is typically a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period. Through its administrative and other management services arrangements to customers who elect to self-fund the health care costs of their employees and employees&#8217; dependents, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual receives a fixed monthly service fee per individual served. These customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and employees&#8217; dependents, while UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual provides services such as coordination and facilitation of medical and related services to customers, consumers and health care professionals, administration of transaction processing and access to a contracted network of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals, including dental and vision professionals. UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual is focused on providing informed benefit solutions that create customized plan designs and clinical programs for employers that contribute to well-being and reduce the total cost of care along with providing simpler consumer experiences in response to market dynamics. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual typically distributes its products through a variety of channels, dependent upon the specific product, including: through consultants or direct sales, in collaboration with brokers and agents, through wholesale agents or agencies who contract with health insurance carriers to distribute individual or group benefits, through professional employer organizations and associations and through both multi-carrier and its own proprietary private exchange marketplaces. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual&#8217;s major product families include consumer engagement products, such as high-deductible consumer driven benefit plans and a variety of innovative consumer centric products; traditional products; clinical and pharmacy products; and specialty benefits, such as vision, dental, hearing, accident protection, critical illness, disability and hospital indemnity offerings. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement \n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement has distinct benefit designs, pricing, underwriting, clinical program management and marketing capabilities dedicated to health products and services in this market. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement offers a selection of products allowing people choice in obtaining the health coverage and services they need as their circumstances change. These offerings include care management and health system navigator services, clinical management programs, nurse health line services, 24-hour access to health care information, access to discounted health services from a network of care providers and administrative services. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement has extensive distribution capabilities and experience, including direct marketing to consumers on behalf of its key clients, including AARP, the nation&#8217;s largest membership organization dedicated to the needs of people age 50 and over, and state and U.S. government agencies. Products are also offered through agents, employer groups and digital channels. \n\nMajor product categories include: \n\nMedicare Advantage. Provides health care coverage for seniors and other eligible Medicare beneficiaries through the Medicare Advantage program administered by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS), including Medicare Advantage HMO plans, Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Point-of-Service plans, Private-Fee-for-Service plans and Special Needs Plans (SNPs). Under the Medicare Advantage program, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement provides health benefits coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS plus, in some cases, monthly consumer premiums. Premium amounts received from CMS vary based on the geographic areas in which individuals reside; demographic factors such as age, gender and institutionalized status; and the health status of the individual. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement served 7.1 million people through its Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2022. \n\nWe have continued to enhance our offerings, focusing on more digital and physical care resources in the home, expanding our concierge navigation services and enabling the home as a safe and effective setting of care. For example, through our HouseCalls program, nurse practitioners performed nearly 2.3 million clinical preventive home care visits in 2022 to address unmet care opportunities and close gaps in care. \n\nMedicare Part D. Provides Medicare Part D benefits to beneficiaries through its Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Medicare Part D plans. The stand-alone Medicare Part D plans address a large spectrum of people&#8217;s needs and preferences for their prescription drug coverage, including low-cost prescription options. As of December 31, 2022, UnitedHealthcare enrolled 9.6 million people in the Medicare Part D programs, including 3.3 million individuals in stand-alone Medicare Part D plans, with the remainder in Medicare Advantage plans incorporating Medicare Part D coverage. \n\nMedicare Supplement. Provides a full range of supplemental products at diverse price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement served 4.4 million seniors nationwide through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP as of December 31, 2022. \n\nPremium revenues from CMS represented 38% of UnitedHealth Group&#8217;s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State \n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State&#8217;s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families; Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2022, UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State participated in programs in 35 states and the District of Columbia, and served 8.2 million people; including 1.5 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 19 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). \n\nStates using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. These health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. \n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION \n\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. We are regulated by agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. U.S. federal and state and international governments continue to consider and enact various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political environment, could adversely affect our businesses. \n\nSee Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. \n\nU.S. Federal Laws and Regulation \n\nWhen we contract with the federal government, we are subject to federal laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. CMS regulates our UnitedHealthcare businesses and certain aspects of our Optum businesses. Payments by CMS to our businesses are subject to regulations, including those governing fee-for-service and the submission of information relating to the health status of enrollees for purposes of determining the amounts of certain payments to us. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with CMS contracts and regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries. Our commercial business is further subject to CMS audits related to medical loss ratios (MLRs) and risk adjustment data. \n\nUnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State has Medicaid and CHIP contracts, which are subject to federal regulations regarding services to be provided to Medicaid enrollees, payment for those services and other aspects of these programs. There are many regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and the regulatory environment with respect to these programs is complex. \n\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. \n\nPrivacy, Security and Data Standards Regulation. Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), which apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit plans. Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. \n\nOur businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. \n\nThe use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data by our businesses are also regulated in some instances by other federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or state statutes implementing GLBA. These federal laws and state statutes generally require insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a third party, and generally prescribe safeguards for the protection of personal information. Neither the GLBA nor HIPAA privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations, which may apply to us, as discussed below. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information. \n\nERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), regulates how our services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) as well as the federal courts. ERISA sets forth standards on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee health benefit plans, particularly those who maintain self-funded plans. Regulations established by the DOL subject us to additional requirements for administration of benefits, claims payment and member appeals under health care plans governed by ERISA. \n\nState Laws and Regulation \n\nHealth Care Regulation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and HMO products regulate those products and operations. The states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted model regulations, which require expanded governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file a confidential self-assessment report with state insurance regulators. We file reports annually with Connecticut, our lead regulator, and with New York, as required by the state&#8217;s regulation. \n\nOur health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain affiliated transactions and general business operations. Most state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material affiliated transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. These laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. \n\nSome of our business activity is subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including PPO, Managed Care Organization (MCO), utilization review (UR), TPA, pharmacy care services, durable medical equipment or care provider-related regulations and licensure requirements. These regulations differ from state to state and may contain network, contracting, product and rate, licensing and financial and reporting requirements. Health care-related laws and regulations set specific standards for delivery of services, appeals, grievances and payment of claims, adequacy of health care professional networks, fraud prevention, protection of consumer health information, pricing and underwriting practices and covered benefits and services. State health care anti-fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services and improper marketing. Certain of our businesses are subject to state general agent, broker and sales distribution laws and regulations. UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State and certain of our Optum businesses are subject to regulation by state Medicaid agencies which oversee the provision of benefits to our Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries and to our beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We also contract with state governmental entities and are subject to state laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of state government contracts. \n\nState Privacy and Security Regulations. A number of states have adopted laws and regulations which may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws governing the use, disclosure and protection of social security numbers and protected health information or which are designed to implement GLBA or protect credit card account data. State and local authorities increasingly focus on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft, with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to meet minimum cyber-security standards and notify individuals of security breaches involving \n\npersonal information. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Different approaches to state privacy and insurance regulation and varying enforcement philosophies may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with state privacy and security regulations. \n\nCorporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws. Certain of our businesses function as direct medical service providers and, as such, are subject to additional laws and regulations. Some states have corporate practice of medicine laws prohibiting specific types of entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians to practice medicine. Moreover, some states prohibit certain entities from engaging in fee-splitting practices, which involve sharing in the fees or revenues of a professional practice. These prohibitions may be statutory or regulatory, or may be imposed through judicial or regulatory interpretation. The laws, regulations and interpretations in certain states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation and are subject to change. \n\nPharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Regulations \n\nOptum Rx&#8217;s businesses include home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, as well as clinic-based pharmacies which must be licensed as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Certain of our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In addition to adhering to the laws and regulations in the states where our pharmacies are located, we also are required to comply with laws and regulations in some non-resident states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including those requiring us to register with the board of pharmacy in the non-resident state. These non-resident states generally expect our pharmacies to follow the laws of the state in which the pharmacies are located, but some non-resident states also require us to comply with their laws where pharmaceuticals are delivered. Additionally, certain of our pharmacies which participate in programs for Medicare and state Medicaid providers are required to comply with applicable Medicare and Medicaid provider rules and regulations. Other laws and regulations affecting our pharmacies include federal and state statutes and regulations governing the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks related to our pharmacy care services businesses. \n\nFederal and state legislation regulating PBM activities affects both our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove network providers. Additionally, many states limit our ability to manage and establish maximum allowable costs for generic prescription drugs. With respect to formulary services, a number of government entities, including CMS, HHS and state departments of insurance, regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits offered through federal or state exchanges. Many states also regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage, as well as the delivery channels to receive such prescriptions, for insurers, MCOs and Medicaid managed care plans. These regulations could limit or preclude (i) certain plan designs, (ii) limited networks, (iii) use of particular care providers or distribution channels, (iv) copayment differentials among providers and (v) formulary tiering practices. \n\nLegislation seeking to regulate PBM activities introduced or enacted at the federal or state level could impact our business practices with others in the pharmacy supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and network providers. In addition, organizations like the NAIC periodically issue model regulations while credentialing organizations, like the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC), may establish standards impacting PBM pharmacy activities. Although these model regulations and standards do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their recommendations and impact the services we deliver to our clients. \n\nConsumer Protection Laws \n\nCertain of our businesses participate in direct-to-consumer activities and are subject to regulations applicable to online communications and other general consumer protection laws and regulations such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Postal Service Act and the FTC&#8217;s Telemarketing Sales Rule. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws. \n\nCertain laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions. \n\nBanking Regulation \n\nOptum Bank is subject to regulation by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which performs annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with federal safety and soundness requirements, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which may perform periodic examinations to ensure the bank is \n\nin compliance with applicable consumer protection statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. Optum Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Utah State Department of Financial Institutions, which carries out annual examinations to ensure the bank is operating in accordance with state safety and soundness requirements and performs periodic examinations of the bank&#8217;s compliance with applicable state banking statutes, regulations and agency guidelines. In the event of unfavorable examination results from any of these agencies, the bank could become subject to increased operational expenses and capital requirements, enhanced governmental oversight and monetary penalties. \n\nNon-U.S. Regulation \n\nCertain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nAs a diversified health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of health care benefits and services. Our competitors include organizations ranging from startups to highly sophisticated Fortune 50 global enterprises, for-profit and non-profit companies, and private and government-sponsored entities. New entrants to our markets and business combinations among our competitors and suppliers also contribute to a dynamic and competitive environment. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; and sales, marketing and pricing. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional discussion of our risks related to competition. \n\n&#160; \n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS \n\nWe have obtained trademark registration for the UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare names and logos. We own registrations for certain of our other trademarks in the United States and abroad. We hold a portfolio of patents and have patent applications pending from time to time. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. \n\nUnless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are trademarks owned by us.

Our mission and cultural values of integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance align with our long-term business strategy to increase access to care, make care more affordable, enhance the care experience, improve health outcomes and advance health equity. Our mission and values attract individuals who are determined to make a difference &#8211; individuals whose talent, innovation, engagement and empowerment are critical in our ability to achieve our mission. Similar to other businesses, in 2022 we experienced moderately higher levels of employment attrition, but due to increased recruiting capacity, upgraded digital capabilities and continued investment in our workforce, we continue to be able to meet the needs of those we serve. \n\nWe are committed to developing our people and culture by creating an inclusive environment where people of diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives make us better. Our approach is data-driven and leader led and uses enterprise and business scorecards to ensure our leaders are accountable for a consistent focus on hiring, developing, advancing and retaining diverse talent. We have embedded inclusion and diversity throughout our culture, including in our talent acquisition and talent management practices; leadership development; careers; learning and skills; and systems and processes. We strive to maintain a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline by building strong strategic partnerships and outreach through early career programs, internships and apprenticeships. We support career coaching, mentorship and accelerated leadership development programs to ensure mobility and advancement for our diverse talent. To foster an engaged workforce and an inclusive culture, we invest in a broad array of learning and culture development programs.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS \n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;should&#8221; or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report. \n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry \n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for and effectively manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual or family served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June of the year before the contract year. Our premium revenue on fully accountable value-based care products at Optum Health is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served. Although we base the commercial, Medicaid and value-based premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. For Optum Health&#8217;s fully accountable value-based care, our inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or our \n\ninability to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. \n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nIf we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur business depends on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions, penalties, investigations or audits; incur increases in operating expenses; or suffer other adverse consequences. \n\nThe volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, automate and deploy new technologies to simplify administrative processes and clinical decision making, price our products and services adequately, provide effective service to our customers and consumers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, provide timely payments to care providers, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. \n\nWe periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems&#8217; capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems&#8217; capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful. Failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management&#8217;s time and energy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nCertain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nUncertain and rapidly evolving U.S. federal and state, non-U.S. and international laws and regulations related to health data and the health information technology market may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially and adversely affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms, and our ability to compete in this market. \n\nIf we or third parties we rely on sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches disrupting our operations or resulting in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. \n\nWe routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. Some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the United States due to our information technology systems and international business operations. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in \n\nsophistication, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, detect breaches for long periods of time or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and access, misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause system shutdowns, negatively affecting our operations. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs attacking our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems which could unexpectedly compromise information security. Our facilities and services may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; financial fraud schemes; misplaced or lost data; human error; malicious social engineering; or other events which could negatively affect our systems, our customers&#8217; data, proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties, or our operations. Moreover, there has been an increase in new financial fraud schemes and ransomware attacks on large companies, whereby cybercriminals install malicious software preventing users or the enterprise from accessing computer files, systems or networks and demand payment of a ransom for return of access. In addition, there may be a heightened vulnerability due to the lack of physical supervision and on-site infrastructure for remote workforce operations. In certain circumstances we may rely on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our business whose operations are subject to similar risks. \n\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be material. We have business continuation and resiliency plans which are maintained, updated and tested regularly in an effort to ensure successful containment and remediation of potential disruptions or cyber events. In the event that our remediation efforts may not be successful, it could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information, proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our customers&#8217; private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and liability, including regulatory penalties, for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. \n\nIf we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur businesses face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. In particular geographies or product segments, our competitors, compared to us, may have greater capabilities, resources or market share; a more established reputation; superior supplier or health care professional arrangements; better existing business relationships; lower profit margin or financial return expectations; or other factors which give such competitors a competitive advantage. Our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. \n\nIn addition, our success in the health care marketplace depends on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services, which are useful and relevant to health care payers, consumers and our customers, we may not remain competitive and risk losing market share to existing competitors and disruptive new market entrants. For example, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits and health care usage. We may face challenges from new technologies and market entrants which could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Any failure by us to continue to develop innovative care models, including accelerating the transition of care to value-based models achieving higher quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs and expanding access to virtual and in-home care, could result in competitive disadvantages and loss of market share. Additionally, our competitive position could be adversely affected by a failure to develop satisfactory data and analytics capabilities or provide services focused on these capabilities to our clients. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows also could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services demonstrating value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products. The expected resumption of Medicaid redeterminations may also impact our ability to maintain market share if we are unable to retain or add new consumers to other benefit offerings. \n\nIf we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, it could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management&#8217;s attention from our operations and result in negative publicity. \n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could diminish our bargaining power. In addition, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); physician group management services organizations (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. \n\nSome providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In some instances, those providers may dispute the payment for these services and may institute litigation or arbitration. \n\nThe success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual&#8217;s international operations, depends on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers. \n\nFurther, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe are routinely subject to various legal actions, which could damage our reputation and, if resolved unfavorably, could result in substantial penalties or monetary damages and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to, among other matters, the design, management and delivery of our product and service offerings. Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. \n\nLegal actions to which we are a party have included or in the future could include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment of claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by staff at our affiliates&#8217; facilities, or by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks, including as a result of a failure to adhere to applicable clinical, quality and/or patient safety standards), antitrust claims (including as a result of changes in the enforcement of antitrust laws), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. \n\nWe are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks, including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded. Additionally, physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. These actions involve significant defense costs and could result in substantial monetary damages or damage to our reputation. \n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved. We incur expenses to resolve these matters and current and future legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Moreover, certain legal actions could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some markets and businesses. \n\nIf we fail to successfully manage our strategic alliances, to complete, manage or integrate acquisitions and other significant strategic transactions or relationships domestically or outside the United States it could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, governmental actions, such as actions by the FTC or DOJ, may affect our ability to complete our merger and acquisition transactions, which could adversely affect our future growth. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions to meet our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\nSuccessful acquisitions are also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage. In addition, even with appropriate diligence, pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations. For example, in January 2021, an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition of SCA. We are vigorously defending this lawsuit, but if SCA is found liable, we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm. If we \n\ncannot successfully integrate our acquired businesses and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nAs we expand and operate our business outside of the United States, we are presented with challenges differing from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from those businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders&#8217; equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events, which have and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. \n\nLarge-scale medical emergencies, pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other extreme events could result in public health crises or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, financial conditions and results of operations. For example, disruptions in public and private infrastructure resulting from such events could increase our operating costs and ability to provide services to our clients and customers. Additionally, as a result of these events, the premiums and fees we charge may not be sufficient to cover our medical and administrative costs, deferred medical care could be sought in future periods at potentially higher acuity levels, we could experience reduced demand for our services, our clinical and non-clinical workforce could be impacted resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care or otherwise impact our business operations. For example, COVID-19 has materially impacted our results of operations in previous periods. Public health crises arising from natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, and snowstorms, or effects of climate change could impact our business operations and result in increased medical care costs. Government enaction of emergency powers in response to public health crises could disrupt our business operations, including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies, and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items. \n\nOur sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants. \n\nOur products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants and we compete for their services and allegiance. Our sales could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels. \n\nUnfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations. \n\nUnfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in people served and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nDuring a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment could also adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum&#8217;s financial results. \n\nOur failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance. \n\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills, to operate and expand our business. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture, which seeks to foster integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance, could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. \n\nOur investment portfolio may suffer losses which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nMarket fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2022. In addition, a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers, or defaults by issuers (primarily issuers of our investments in corporate and municipal bonds), could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments which could adversely affect our profitability and equity. \n\nOur investments may not produce total positive returns and we may sell investments at prices which are less than their carrying values. Changes in the value of our investment assets, as a result of interest rate fluctuations, changes in issuer financial or market conditions, illiquidity or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equity. In addition, if it should become necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis, such an action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of our regulated subsidiaries. \n\nIf the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, equity and credit ratings could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of $108 billion, representing 44% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. The value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if businesses we acquire perform in a manner inconsistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in equity could, in turn, adversely affect our credit ratings. \n\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWe rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nClaims paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customers and creditors. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically. Our ratings reflect each credit rating agency&#8217;s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. We may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings in the future. Any downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds in the debt capital markets and otherwise materially increase our operating costs. \n\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Business \n\nOur business activities in the United States and other countries are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business. \n\nWe are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including regulations and licensure requirements related to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPAs. Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies which write the same line or similar lines of business. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk they would be required to pay a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company&#8217;s claims through state guaranty associations. \n\nCertain of our businesses provide products or services to government agencies. For example, some of our Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses hold government contracts or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of our contracts with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies which might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of engagements, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nCertain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services, or to achieve targeted operating margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate. \n\nThe laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. For example, legislative, administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will continue to be considered, and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified. Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part and future litigation challenges are possible. Further, the integration of entities we acquire into our businesses may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. \n\nWe also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on proposed rate increases to HHS on many of our products for monitoring purposes. Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-U.S. regulatory regimes, which vary by jurisdiction, encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers). For example, our UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual international business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Ag&#234;ncia Nacional de Sa&#250;de Suplementar, while our Banm&#233;dica business is subject to Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian laws, regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance. Any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations which could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. \n\nThe health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. \n\nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members&#8217; benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments. \n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, number of people we serve, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers. Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits, which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS. \n\nWe have been involved, and in the future may become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Such investigations, audits, reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of, or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who, among other allegations, may claim we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false or erroneous claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which have resulted in, and in the future could result in, adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nOur pharmacy care services businesses face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses. \n\nWe provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses. Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Further, various governmental agencies have conducted and continue to conduct investigations and studies into certain PBM practices, which have resulted and may result in PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements, or could materially and adversely impact the PBM business model. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards. Optum Rx conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy. \n\nWe could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery, specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services, claims related to the inherent risks in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions from any of our home delivery, specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nIn addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA. A private party or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the \n\nstatute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations. If a court were to determine such fiduciary obligations apply, we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions. \n\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and addressed in requirements imposed on us by contracts with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. \n\nInternationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the European Union, Brazil, Chile, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers. For example, the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers, and prescribes greater penalties for noncompliance. Brazilian privacy legislation, similar in certain respects to GDPR, took effect in September 2020. \n\nMany of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data. \n\nHIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers. HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates. An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nThrough our Optum businesses, we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards. Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and, among other consequences, could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents, and material fines, penalties and litigation awards. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nRestrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \n\nBecause we operate as a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Many of these subsidiaries are regulated by state departments of insurance or similar regulatory authorities. We are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily on the volume of premium revenues generated by the applicable subsidiary. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies in the desired amounts or at the time of our choosing could adversely affect our ability to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions, as well as our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment, repurchase shares of our common stock and repay our debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n"

Our two complementary businesses &#8212; Optum and UnitedHealthcare &#8212; are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. \n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare: \n\n&#8226; Optum Health; \n\n&#8226; Optum Insight; \n\n&#8226; Optum Rx; and \n\n&#8226; UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State. \n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221; and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nBusiness Trends \n\nOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs. \n\nPricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions. \n\nThe commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. \n\nMedicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in &#8220;Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.&#8221; \n\nIn Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. \n\nMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs; care activity; and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. \n\nMedicaid Redeterminations. In December 2022, Congress passed the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill that allows states to resume Medicaid redeterminations beginning in April 2023. Redeterminations will result in a decline in people served through our Medicaid business and an expected increase in people served through our commercial and exchange-based offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people have continued access to benefits. \n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration. \n\nThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. \n\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties \n\nFollowing is a summary of management&#8217;s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 &#8220;Business - Government Regulation&#8221; and Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nMedicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the February 2023 Advance Notice for 2024 rates would result in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, proposed substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient&#8217;s health status and care resource needs, would result in reduced funding and benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. \n\nAs a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. \n\nSELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS \n\nThe following represents a summary of select 2022 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2021. \n\n&#8226; Consolidated revenues increased by 13%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 12% and Optum revenues grew 17%. \n\n&#8226; UnitedHealthcare served nearly 1.1 million more people, led by growth in community-based and senior offerings. \n\n&#8226; Earnings from operations increased by 19%, including an increase of 20% at UnitedHealthcare and 17% at Optum. \n\n&#8226; Diluted earnings per common share increased 17% to $21.18. \n\n&#8226; Cash flows from operations were $26.2 billion. \n\n&#8226; Return on equity was 27.2%. \n\nRESULTS SUMMARY \n\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Revenues: Premiums $ 257,157 $ 226,233 $ 201,478 $ 30,924 14 % Products 37,424 34,437 34,145 2,987 9 Services 27,551 24,603 20,016 2,948 12 Investment and other income \n\n2,030 2,324 1,502 (294) (13) Total revenues 324,162 287,597 257,141 36,565 13 Operating costs: Medical costs 210,842 186,911 159,396 23,931 13 Operating costs 47,782 42,579 41,704 5,203 12 Cost of products sold 33,703 31,034 30,745 2,669 9 Depreciation and amortization \n\n3,400 3,103 2,891 297 10 Total operating costs 295,727 263,627 234,736 32,100 12 Earnings from operations 28,435 23,970 22,405 4,465 19 Interest expense (2,092) (1,660) (1,663) (432) 26 Earnings before income taxes 26,343 22,310 20,742 4,033 18 Provision for income taxes (5,704) (4,578) (4,973) (1,126) 25 Net earnings 20,639 17,732 15,769 2,907 16 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n(519) (447) (366) (72) 16 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders \n\n$ 20,120 $ 17,285 $ 15,403 $ 2,835 16 % Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders \n\n$ 21.18 $ 18.08 $ 16.03 $ 3.10 17 % Medical care ratio (a) 82.0 % 82.6 % 79.1 % (0.6) % Operating cost ratio 14.7 14.8 16.2 (0.1) Operating margin 8.8 8.3 8.7 0.5 Tax rate 21.7 20.5 24.0 1.2 Net earnings margin (b) 6.2 6.0 6.0 0.2 Return on equity (c) 27.2 % 25.2 % 24.9 % 2.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\n________ \n\n(a) Medical care ratio (MCR) is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue. \n\n(b) Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders. \n\n(c) Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders&#8217; equity.

The MCR decreased due to COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development and business mix. \n\nOperating Cost Ratio \n\nThe operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to productivity gains, partially offset by investments and business mix. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nSee Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: ##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Revenues UnitedHealthcare $ 249,741 $ 222,899 $ 200,875 $ 26,842 12 % Optum Health 71,174 54,065 39,808 17,109 32 Optum Insight 14,581 12,199 10,802 2,382 20 Optum Rx 99,773 91,314 87,498 8,459 9 Optum eliminations (2,760) (2,013) (1,800) (747) 37 Optum \n\n182,768 155,565 136,308 27,203 17 Eliminations (108,347) (90,867) (80,042) (17,480) 19 Consolidated revenues $ 324,162 $ 287,597 $ 257,141 $ 36,565 13 % Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $ 14,379 $ 11,975 $ 12,359 $ 2,404 20 % Optum Health 6,032 4,462 3,434 1,570 35 Optum Insight 3,588 3,398 2,725 190 6 Optum Rx 4,436 4,135 3,887 301 7 Optum \n\n14,056 11,995 10,046 2,061 17 Consolidated earnings from operations \n\n$ 28,435 $ 23,970 $ 22,405 $ 4,465 19 % Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 5.8 % 5.4 % 6.2 % 0.4 % Optum Health 8.5 8.3 8.6 0.2 Optum Insight 24.6 27.9 25.2 (3.3) Optum Rx 4.4 4.5 4.4 (0.1) Optum \n\n7.7 7.7 7.4 &#8212; Consolidated operating margin 8.8 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 0.5 % ##TABLE_END\n\nUnitedHealthcare \n\nThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: ##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual - Domestic $ 63,599 $ 60,023 $ 55,872 $ 3,576 6 % UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual - Global (a) 8,668 8,345 7,752 323 4 UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual - Total (a) 72,267 68,368 63,624 3,899 6 UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement \n\n113,671 100,552 90,764 13,119 13 UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State \n\n63,803 53,979 46,487 9,824 18 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues $ 249,741 $ 222,899 $ 200,875 $ 26,842 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) On January 1, 2022, we realigned our operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual. \n\nThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: ##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Commercial - domestic: Risk-based 8,045 7,985 7,910 60 1 % Fee-based 18,640 18,595 18,310 45 &#8212; Total commercial - domestic 26,685 26,580 26,220 105 &#8212; Medicare Advantage 7,105 6,490 5,710 615 9 Medicaid 8,170 7,655 6,620 515 7 Medicare Supplement (Standardized) 4,375 4,395 4,460 (20) &#8212; Total community and senior 19,650 18,540 16,790 1,110 6 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical 46,335 45,120 43,010 1,215 3 Commercial - global 5,360 5,510 5,425 (150) (3) Total UnitedHealthcare - medical 51,695 50,630 48,435 1,065 2 % Supplemental Data: Medicare Part D stand-alone 3,295 3,700 4,045 (405) (11) % ##TABLE_END\n\nMedicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans. \n\nUnitedHealthcare&#8217;s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Earnings from operations increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development. \n\nOptum \n\nTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows: \n\nOptum Health \n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in the number of people served under value-based care arrangements, cost management initiatives, asset dispositions and COVID-19 effects. Optum Health served approximately 102 million people as of December 31, 2022 compared to 100 million people as of December 31, 2021. \n\nOptum Insight \n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, with managed services revenue growth driven by business combinations and new health system partnerships. \n\nOptum Rx \n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services, including community health, specialty and home delivery pharmacies. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,438 million and 1,368 million adjusted scripts in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nLiquidity \n\nIntroduction \n\nWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. \n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies. \n\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.8 billion and $8.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends. \n\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. \n\nSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents ##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, Change (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 26,206 $ 22,343 $ 22,174 $ 3,863 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments 12,536 2,481 2,586 10,055 Proceeds from common share issuances \n\n1,253 1,355 1,440 (102) Customer funds administered \n\n5,548 622 1,677 4,926 Cash received for dispositions 3,414 15 221 3,399 Total sources of cash 48,957 26,816 28,098 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed \n\n(21,458) (4,821) (7,139) (16,637) Cash dividends paid (5,991) (5,280) (4,584) (711) Common share repurchases (7,000) (5,000) (4,250) (2,000) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software \n\n(2,802) (2,454) (2,051) (348) Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (6,837) (1,843) (2,836) (4,994) Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (176) (1,338) &#8212; 1,162 Other (2,737) (1,564) (1,186) (1,173) Total uses of cash (47,001) (22,300) (22,046) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents \n\n34 (62) (116) 96 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,990 $ 4,454 $ 5,936 $ (2,464) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash Flows \n\nIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts and increased net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of long-term debt, customer funds administered, primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing and increased HSA deposits, cash received for dispositions and decreased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions, net purchases of investments and common stock repurchases. \n\nFinancial Condition \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $69.4 billion included $23.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.3 billion was available for general corporate use), $42.3 billion of debt securities and $3.7 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for further detail concerning our fair value measurements. \n\nOur available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.0 years and a weighted-average credit rating of &#8220;Double A&#8221; as of December 31, 2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating. \n\nCapital Resources and Uses of Liquidity \n\nCash Requirements. The Company&#8217;s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. \n\nOur long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: \n\n&#8226; Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually. \n\n&#8226; Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. \n\n&#8226; Purchase and other obligations. These include $5.6 billion, $2.9 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; Other liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments. \n\n&#8226; Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; for further detail. We do not have any material expected redemptions in the next twelve months. \n\nWe expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. \n\nShort-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nOur revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders&#8217; equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders&#8217; equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%. \n\nLong-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nCredit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: ##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nMoody&#8217;s S&#38;P Global Fitch A.M. Best &#160; Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt A3 Positive A+ Stable A Stable A Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1+ n/a ##TABLE_END\n\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. \n\nShare Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, we had Board of Directors&#8217; authorization to purchase up to 31 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nDividends. In June 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors increased the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nPending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. We completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023. \n\nWe do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. \n\nMedical Costs Payable \n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service. \n\nIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2022, 2021 and 2020 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $410 million, $1.7 billion and $880 million, respectively. \n\nIn developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. \n\nCompletion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START Completion Factors (Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 765 (0.50) 508 (0.25) 254 0.25 (252) 0.50 (503) 0.75 (753) ##TABLE_END\n\nMedical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics. \n\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) In Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 985 2 656 1 328 (1) (328) (2) (656) (3) (985) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. \n\nManagement believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2022 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2022 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $215 million. \n\nFor more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nGoodwill \n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. \n\nFinancial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units&#8217; operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2022, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. \n\nLEGAL MATTERS \n\nA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK \n\nInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $31 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2022, $16 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. \n\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, $38 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $43 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. \n\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income. \n\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2 % $ 629 $ 327 $ (3,390) $ (7,365) 1 314 164 (1,746) (4,002) (1) (314) (135) 1,838 4,808 (2) (629) (266) 3,746 10,641 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate Investment Income Per Annum Interest Expense Per Annum Fair Value of Financial Assets Fair Value of Financial Liabilities 2% $ 499 $ 133 $ (3,080) $ (8,664) 1 250 67 (1,564) (4,723) (1) (85) (7) 1,398 5,655 (2) (85) (7) 1,857 10,892 ##TABLE_END\n\nNote: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero. \n\nWe have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual&#8217;s international business operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. \n\nAn appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $560 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $ 3.7 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. \n\n"

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nIncurred but not Reported (IBNR) Claim Liability - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements. \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nMedical costs payable includes estimates of the Company&#8217;s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. These estimates are referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s IBNR balance was $20 billion. The Company develops IBNR estimates using an actuarial model that requires management to exercise certain judgments in developing its estimates. Judgments made by management include medical cost per member per month trend factors and completion factors, which include assumptions over the time from date of service to claim receipt, the impact of actual care activity, and processing cycles. \n\nWe identified the IBNR claim liability as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the liability. This required complex auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of actuarial specialists in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s methods, assumptions and judgments in developing the liability. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s estimate of the IBNR claim liability balance, including controls over the judgments in both the completion factors and the medical cost per member per month trend factors, as well as controls over the claims and membership data used in the estimation process. \n\n&#8226; We tested the underlying claims and membership data and other information that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the actuarial methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBNR claim liability by: \n\n&#9702; Performing an overlay of the historical claims data used in management&#8217;s current year model to the data used in prior periods to validate that there were no material changes to the claims data tested in prior periods. \n\n&#9702; Developing an independent estimate of the IBNR claim liability and comparing our estimate to management&#8217;s estimate. \n\n&#9702; Performing a retrospective review comparing management&#8217;s prior year estimate of IBNR to claims processed in 2022 with dates of service in 2021 or prior. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n/ S / DELOITTE &#38;

Description of Business \n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;UnitedHealth Group&#8221; and &#8220;the Company&#8221;) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary business platforms &#8212; Optum and UnitedHealthcare &#8212; are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve. \n\n2. Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThe Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company&#8217;s best estimates and judgments. The Company&#8217;s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted. \n\nRevenues \n\nPremiums \n\nPremium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and the Company assumes the economic risk of funding its customers&#8217; health care and related administrative costs. \n\nPremium revenues are recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care benefits. Health care premium payments received from the Company&#8217;s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company&#8217;s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans&#8217; Star rating. Certain of the Company&#8217;s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates. \n\nPremium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS&#8217; risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company&#8217;s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits. \n\nProducts and Services \n\nFor the Company&#8217;s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors&#8217; members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis. \n\nServices revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health&#8217;s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers. \n\nServices revenue also consists of fees derived from services performed for customers who self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees&#8217; dependents. Under service fee contracts, the Company receives monthly, a fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees&#8217; dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, accounts receivables related to products and services were $ 7.1 billion and $ 5.4 billion, respectively. In 2022 and 2021, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material. \n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $ 12.5 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years. \n\nSee Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type. \n\nMedical Costs and Medical Costs Payable \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimate of medical costs payable represents management&#8217;s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2022. \n\nEach period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90 % of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. \n\nMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company&#8217;s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and \n\ndemographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. \n\nIn developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. \n\nCost of Products Sold \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company&#8217;s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services. \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments \n\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. \n\nInvestments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. \n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. \n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security&#8217;s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. \n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company&#8217;s investment policy. \n\nAssets Under Management \n\nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. \n\nPursuant to the Company&#8217;s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company&#8217;s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company&#8217;s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. \n\nThe effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nOther Current Receivables \n\nOther current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers&#8217; products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $ 8.2 billion and $ 7.2 billion, respectively. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company&#8217;s Medicare Part D receivables amounted to $ 1.3 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively. \n\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets \n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets include pharmaceutical drug and supplies inventory of $ 3.5 billion and $ 2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nProperty, Equipment and Capitalized Software \n\nProperty, equipment and capitalized software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development. \n\nThe Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: ##TABLE_START Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years \n\nBuildings 35 to 40 years \n\nCapitalized software 3 to 5 years \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or their estimated useful economic life. \n\nOperating Leases \n\nThe Company leases facilities and equipment under long-term operating leases which are non-cancelable and expire on various dates. At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet . \n\nGoodwill \n\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nThere was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nIntangible Assets \n\nThe Company&#8217;s intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company&#8217;s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nOther Current Liabilities \n\nOther current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($ 13.5 billion and $ 11.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively), accruals for premium rebates payable, the RSF associated with the AARP Program, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances. \n\nPolicy Acquisition Costs \n\nThe Company&#8217;s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days&#8217; notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred. \n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests \n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside of the Company&#8217;s control are classified as temporary equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares, which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated redemption value is not material. The following table provides details of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests&#8217; activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 Redeemable noncontrolling interests, beginning of period $ 1,434 &#160; $ 2,211 &#160; Net earnings 113 &#160; 87 &#160; Acquisitions 3,108 &#160; 28 &#160; Redemptions ( 176 ) ( 1,338 ) Distributions ( 82 ) ( 255 ) Fair value and other adjustments 500 &#160; 701 &#160; Redeemable noncontrolling interests, end of period $ 4,897 &#160; $ 1,434 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively, restricted shares), on a straight-line basis over the related service period (generally the vesting period) of the award, or to an employee&#8217;s eligible retirement date under the award agreement, if earlier. Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years, and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company&#8217;s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company&#8217;s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nNet Earnings Per Common Share \n\nThe Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period.

The Company&#8217;s investments in equity securities primarily consist of employee savings plan related investments, venture investments and shares of Brazilian real denominated fixed-income funds with readily determinable fair values. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s investments included $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.3 billion of equity method investments in operating businesses in the health care sector, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company believes it will collect the timely principal and interest due on its debt securities having an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company&#8217;s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material. \n\n4. Fair Value \n\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. \n\nThe fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows: \n\nLevel 1 &#8212; Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets. \n\nLevel 2 &#8212; Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including: \n\n&#8226; Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets; \n\n&#8226; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time); \n\n&#8226; Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and \n\n&#8226; Inputs corroborated by other observable market data. \n\nLevel 3 &#8212; Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data. \n\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $ 211 million and $ 840 million, respectively, of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in our venture portfolio, based upon transaction of the same or similar security. There were no other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below: \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2. \n\nDebt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt securities and equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company&#8217;s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service. \n\nFair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2. \n\nFair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices. \n\nThe fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations. \n\nThroughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company&#8217;s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding. \n\nAssets Under Management. Assets under management consists of debt securities and other investments held to fund costs associated with the AARP Program and are priced and classified using the same methodologies as the Company&#8217;s investments in debt and equity securities. \n\nLong-Term Debt. The fair values of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt are estimated and classified using the same methodologies as the Company&#8217;s investments in debt securities. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair and Carrying Value December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 23,202 &#160; $ 163 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 23,365 &#160; Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,505 &#160; 304 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,809 &#160; State and municipal obligations &#8212; &#160; 7,248 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7,248 &#160; Corporate obligations 7 &#160; 21,695 &#160; 192 &#160; 21,894 &#160; U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 6,586 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,586 &#160; Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 2,784 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,784 &#160; Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,512 &#160; 38,617 &#160; 192 &#160; 42,321 &#160; Equity securities 2,043 &#160; 35 &#160; 70 &#160; 2,148 &#160; Assets under management 1,788 &#160; 2,203 &#160; 96 &#160; 4,087 &#160; Total assets at fair value $ 30,545 &#160; $ 41,018 &#160; $ 358 &#160; $ 71,921 &#160; Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,359 &#160; $ 16 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 21,375 &#160; Debt securities - available-for-sale: U.S. government and agency obligations 3,017 &#160; 181 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,198 &#160; State and municipal obligations &#8212; &#160; 7,106 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7,106 &#160; Corporate obligations 40 &#160; 20,916 &#160; 218 &#160; 21,174 &#160; U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 5,901 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,901 &#160; Non-U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities &#8212; &#160; 2,838 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,838 &#160; Total debt securities - available-for-sale 3,057 &#160; 36,942 &#160; 218 &#160; 40,217 &#160; Equity securities 2,090 &#160; 23 &#160; 64 &#160; 2,177 &#160; Assets under management 1,972 &#160; 2,376 &#160; 101 &#160; 4,449 &#160; Total assets at fair value $ 28,478 &#160; $ 39,357 &#160; $ 383 &#160; $ 68,218 &#160; Percentage of total assets at fair value 42 % 57 % 1 % 100 % ##TABLE_END \n\nThe following table presents a summary of fair value measurements by level and carrying values for certain financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Total Carrying Value December 31, 2022 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 577 &#160; $ 102 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 679 &#160; $ 696 &#160; Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ &#8212; &#160; $ 53,626 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 53,626 &#160; $ 56,823 &#160; December 31, 2021 Debt securities - held-to-maturity $ 534 &#160; $ 102 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 643 &#160; $ 641 &#160; Long-term debt and other financing obligations $ &#8212; &#160; $ 52,583 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 52,583 &#160; $ 46,003 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.

Substantially all of the IBNR balance as of December 31, 2022 relates to the current year. \n\nThe following is information about incurred and paid medical cost development as of December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START Net Incurred Medical Costs &#160;(in millions) For the Years Ended December 31, Year 2021 2022 2021 $ 188,631 &#160; $ 188,407 &#160; 2022 211,252 &#160; Total $ 399,659 &#160; Net Cumulative Medical Payments &#160;(in millions) For the Years Ended December 31, Year 2021 2022 2021 $ ( 165,524 ) $ ( 186,944 ) 2022 ( 184,049 ) Total ( 370,993 ) Net remaining outstanding liabilities prior to 2021 390 &#160; Total medical costs payable $ 29,056 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n8.

2024 3,136 &#160; 2025 3,186 &#160; 2026 2,636 &#160; 2027 3,061 &#160; Thereafter 43,638 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nShort-Term Borrowings \n\nCommercial paper consists of short-duration, senior unsecured debt privately placed on a discount basis through broker-dealers. \n\nThe Company has $ 6.0 billion five -year, $ 6.0 billion three -year and $ 6.0 billion 364 -day revolving bank credit facilities with 25 banks, which mature in December 2027, December 2025 and December 2023, respectively. These facilities provide full liquidity support for the Company&#8217;s commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts had been drawn on any of the bank credit facilities. The annual interest rates, which are variable based on term, are calculated based on one-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a SOFR Adjustment of 10 basis points plus a credit spread based on the Company&#8217;s senior unsecured credit ratings. If amounts had been drawn on the bank credit facilities as of December 31, 2022, annual interest rates would have ranged from 5.1 % to 7.5 %. \n\nDebt Covenants \n\nThe Company&#8217;s bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain a debt to debt-plus-shareholders&#8217; equity ratio of not more than 60%. The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2022. \n\n9. Income Taxes \n\nThe current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported. The deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current Provision: &#160; &#160; Federal $ 4,842 &#160; $ 3,451 &#160; $ 4,098 &#160; State and local 855 &#160; 481 &#160; 392 &#160; Foreign 680 &#160; 516 &#160; 491 &#160; Total current provision 6,377 &#160; 4,448 &#160; 4,981 &#160; Deferred (benefit) provision ( 673 ) 130 &#160; ( 8 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 5,704 &#160; $ 4,578 &#160; $ 4,973 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe reconciliation of the tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 Tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate $ 5,532 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 4,685 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 4,356 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 621 &#160; 2.4 &#160; 419 &#160; 1.9 &#160; 315 &#160; 1.5 &#160; Share-based awards - excess tax benefit ( 110 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 100 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 130 ) ( 0.6 ) Non-deductible compensation 150 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 144 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 134 &#160; 0.7 &#160; Health insurance tax &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 626 &#160; 3.0 &#160; Foreign rate differential ( 265 ) ( 1.0 ) ( 246 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 164 ) ( 0.8 ) Other, net ( 224 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 324 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 164 ) ( 0.8 ) Provision for income taxes $ 5,704 &#160; 21.7 &#160; % $ 4,578 &#160; 20.5 &#160; % $ 4,973 &#160; 24.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws.

The valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 490 million expire beginning in 2023 through 2037 and $ 611 million have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2023 through 2042, with some having an indefinite carryforward period. Substantially all of the non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. Taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings would be minimal. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of period $ 2,310 &#160; $ 1,829 &#160; $ 1,423 &#160; Gross increases: &#160; &#160; &#160; Current year tax positions \n\n586 &#160; 538 &#160; 416 &#160; Prior year tax positions \n\n206 &#160; 10 &#160; 120 &#160; Gross decreases: &#160; &#160; &#160; Prior year tax positions \n\n( 21 ) ( 47 ) ( 130 ) Statute of limitations lapses \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 20 ) &#8212; &#160; Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of period $ 3,081 &#160; $ 2,310 &#160; $ 1,829 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months by $ 260 million as a result of audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. \n\nThe Company classifies net interest and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions as income taxes within its Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $ 64 million, $ 66 million and $ 52 million of net interest and penalties, respectively. The Company had $ 253 million and $ 194 million of accrued interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. As of December 31, 2022, there were $ 1.7 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. \n\nThe Company currently files income tax returns in the United States, various states and localities and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed exams on the consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 and prior. The Company&#8217;s 2017 through 2020 tax years are under review by the IRS under its Compliance Assurance Program. With the exception of a few states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations prior to the 2014 tax year. In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward. \n\n10. Shareholders' Equity \n\nRegulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary&#8217;s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as &#8220;ordinary dividends&#8221; and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an &#8220;extraordinary dividend&#8221; and must receive prior regulatory approval. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.8 billion, including $ 7.4 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $ 8.0 billion, including $ 4.7 billion of extraordinary dividends. \n\nThe Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $ 33.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $ 15.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. \n\nOptum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2022, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered &#8220;Well Capitalized.&#8221; \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nUnder its Board of Directors&#8217; authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company&#8217;s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2018, the Board of Directors renewed the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. \n\nA summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Common share repurchases, shares 14 &#160; 13 &#160; Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 501.67 &#160; $ 389.92 &#160; Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 7,000 &#160; $ 5,000 &#160; Board authorized shares remaining 31 &#160; 45 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDividends \n\nIn June 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors increased the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2021. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. \n\nThe following table provides details of the Company&#8217;s 2022 dividend payments: ##TABLE_START Payment Date Amount per Share Total Amount Paid (in millions) March 22 $ 1.45 &#160; $ 1,363 &#160; June 28 1.65 &#160; 1,545 &#160; September 20 1.65 &#160; 1,542 &#160; December 13 1.65 &#160; 1,541 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n11. Share-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company&#8217;s outstanding share-based awards consist mainly of non-qualified stock options and restricted shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 59 million shares available for future grants of share-based awards under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2022, there were 18 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. \n\nStock Options \n\nStock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value &#160; (in millions) &#160; (in years) (in millions) Outstanding at beginning of period 25 &#160; $ 241 &#160; Granted 4 &#160; 459 &#160; Exercised ( 5 ) 215 &#160; Forfeited ( 1 ) 356 &#160; Outstanding at end of period 23 &#160; 281 &#160; 5.8 $ 5,914 &#160; Exercisable at end of period 13 &#160; 213 &#160; 4.4 4,170 &#160; Vested and expected to vest, end of period 23 &#160; 278 &#160; 5.7 5,854 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nRestricted Shares \n\nRestricted share activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is summarized in the table below: ##TABLE_START (shares in millions) Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Nonvested at beginning of period 4 &#160; $ 303 &#160; Granted 2 &#160; 483 &#160; Vested ( 2 ) 287 &#160; Nonvested at end of period 4 &#160; 401 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Share-Based Compensation Data ##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share amounts) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Stock Options Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share $ 116 &#160; $ 71 &#160; $ 54 &#160; Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised 1,419 &#160; 1,519 &#160; 1,736 &#160; Restricted Shares Weighted-average grant date fair value of shares granted, per share 483 &#160; 352 &#160; 303 &#160; Total fair value of restricted shares vested $ 760 &#160; $ 560 &#160; $ 574 &#160; Employee Stock Purchase Plan Number of shares purchased 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Share-Based Compensation Items Share-based compensation expense, before tax $ 925 &#160; $ 800 &#160; $ 679 &#160; Share-based compensation expense, net of tax effects 836 &#160; 719 &#160; 619 &#160; Income tax benefit realized from share-based award exercises 207 &#160; 173 &#160; 208 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except years) December 31, 2022 Unrecognized compensation expense related to share awards $ 1,165 &#160; Weighted-average years to recognize compensation expense 1.3 ##TABLE_END\n\nShare-Based Compensation Recognition and Estimates \n\nThe principal assumptions the Company used in calculating grant-date fair value for stock options were as follows: ##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 1.9% - 4.3% 0.7% - 1.2% 0.2% - 1.4% Expected volatility 30.6% -30.8% 29.2% - 29.8% 22.2% - 29.5% Expected dividend yield 1.2% 1.3% - 1.5% 1.4% - 1.7% Forfeiture rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Expected life in years 4.7 4.8 5.1 ##TABLE_END \n\nRisk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock and the implied volatility from exchange-traded options on the Company&#8217;s common stock. Expected dividend yields are based on the per share cash dividend paid by the Company. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected lives of options granted represents the period of time the awards granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise patterns. \n\nOther Employee Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan for its employees. Compensation expense related to this plan was not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nIn addition, the Company maintains non-qualified, deferred compensation plans, which allow certain members of senior management and executives to defer portions of their salary or bonus. The deferrals are recorded within long-term investments with an approximately equal amount in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under each plan and were $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n12. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLeases \n\nOperating lease costs, including immaterial variable and short-term lease costs, were $ 1.3 billion, $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash payments made on the Company&#8217;s operating lease liabilities were $ 996 million, $ 921 million and $ 865 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were classified within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for its operating leases were 8.6 years and 3.4 %, respectively. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, future minimum annual lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions) Future Minimum Lease Payments 2023 $ 997 &#160; 2024 858 &#160; 2025 702 &#160; 2026 578 &#160; 2027 475 &#160; Thereafter 2,028 &#160; Total future minimum lease payments 5,638 &#160; Less imputed interest ( 808 ) Total $ 4,830 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nOther Commitments \n\nThe Company provides guarantees related to its service level under certain contracts. If minimum standards are not met, the Company may be financially at risk up to a stated percentage of the contracted fee or a stated dollar amount. None of the amounts accrued, paid or charged to income for service level guarantees were material as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nPending Acquisitions \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $ 9 billion. The Company completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023. \n\nLegal Matters \n\nThe Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company&#8217;s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices. \n\nThe Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to \n\nestimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred. \n\nGovernment Investigations, Audits and Reviews \n\nThe Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, our international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company&#8217;s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company&#8217;s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company&#8217;s health plans. \n\nOn February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower&#8217;s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company&#8217;s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company&#8217;s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government&#8217;s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company&#8217;s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status. \n\n13. Business Combinations \n\nOn October 3, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Change Healthcare Inc. (Change) and funded Change&#8217;s payoff of its outstanding debt and credit facility for a total of $ 13.9 billion in cash. The combination of the Company and Change will connect and simplify the core clinical, administrative and payment processes health care providers and payers depend on to serve patients. Change brings key technologies, connections and advanced clinical decision, administrative and financial support capabilities, enabling better workflow and transactional connectivity across the health care system. \n\nSubsequent to closing and as planned, the Company sold Change&#8217;s claims editing business to an affiliate of investment funds of TPG Inc. for $ 2.2 billion in cash. The net assets and net liabilities associated with this sale were classified as held-for-sale at the time of acquisition. There was no gain or loss associated with this transaction. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed several other business combinations for total consideration of $ 8.8 billion. The Company also sold other businesses for $ 1.2 billion of cash, with a carrying value of $ 600 million, and the difference reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nAcquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were: ##TABLE_START (in millions) Change Other Acquisitions Total Cash and cash equivalents $ 222 &#160; $ 523 &#160; $ 745 &#160; Accounts receivable and other current assets 925 &#160; 696 &#160; 1,621 &#160; Assets held-for-sale 2,310 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,310 &#160; Property, equipment and other long-term assets 254 &#160; 1,882 &#160; 2,136 &#160; Other intangible assets 4,050 &#160; 1,764 &#160; 5,814 &#160; Total identifiable assets acquired 7,761 &#160; 4,865 &#160; 12,626 &#160; Medical costs payable &#8212; &#160; ( 308 ) ( 308 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities ( 1,017 ) ( 843 ) ( 1,860 ) Liabilities held-for-sale ( 101 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 101 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 1,193 ) ( 713 ) ( 1,906 ) Total identifiable liabilities acquired ( 2,311 ) ( 1,864 ) ( 4,175 ) Total net identifiable assets 5,450 &#160; 3,001 &#160; 8,451 &#160; Goodwill 8,496 &#160; 9,214 &#160; 17,710 &#160; Redeemable noncontrolling interests &#8212; &#160; ( 3,108 ) ( 3,108 ) Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests &#8212; &#160; ( 370 ) ( 370 ) Net assets acquired $ 13,946 &#160; $ 8,737 &#160; $ 22,683 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized. \n\nThe acquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to finite-lived intangible assets acquired consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Change Other Acquisitions Total (in millions, except years) Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Fair Value Weighted-Average Useful Life Customer-related $ 3,063 &#160; 15 years $ 864 &#160; 13 years $ 3,927 &#160; 15 years Trademarks and technology 977 &#160; 6 years 81 &#160; 4 years 1,058 &#160; 6 years Other 10 &#160; 1 year 766 &#160; 13 years 776 &#160; 13 years Total acquired finite-lived intangible assets $ 4,050 &#160; 13 years $ 1,711 &#160; 13 years $ 5,761 &#160; 13 years ##TABLE_END \n\nThe results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2022, acquired entities impact on revenues and net earnings was not material. \n\nUnaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2021, were immaterial for both periods. \n\n14. Segment Financial Information \n\nFactors used to determine the Company&#8217;s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined. \n\nThe following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company&#8217;s four reportable segments derives its revenues: \n\n&#8226; UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. Domestically, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for employers and individuals. Globally, UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual provides health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employers and individuals in South America and other diversified global businesses. UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs. UnitedHealthcare Community &#38; State provides diversified health care benefits products and services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage. \n\n&#8226; Optum Health focuses on care delivery, care management, wellness and consumer engagement, and health financial services. Optum Health is building a comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their health through in-person, in-home, virtual and digital clinical platforms. \n\n&#8226; Optum Insight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system. \n\n&#8226; Optum Rx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease/drug therapy management. Optum Rx integrates pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2 ). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by Optum Rx; care delivery, care management services and certain product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health; and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at management&#8217;s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital. \n\nAs a percentage of the Company&#8217;s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 38 %, 36 % and 36 % for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare &#38; Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 97 % of consolidated total revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 81 % and 78 % of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Employer &#38; Individual&#8217;s international businesses. \n\nThe following table presents the reportable segment financial information: ##TABLE_START &#160;

      "text": " ITEM 9A. &#160; CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nIn connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. \n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2022 \n\nManagement of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company&#8217;s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm , appearing under Item 9A. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Subsidiaries: \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2022. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . \n\n##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota February 24, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\n"
