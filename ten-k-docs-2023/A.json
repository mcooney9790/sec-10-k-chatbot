At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent's businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value. \n\nThe technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including molecular and cell biology, chemistry, physics, pathology, mathematics, software and informatics, artificial intelligence, deep and machine learning, image processing, nano/microfabrication, and fluidics. \n\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization \n\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology services, order administration and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of October 31, 2022, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,700 people worldwide. \n\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations \n\nOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (&#8220;OFS&#8221;) focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses. \n\n&#160; The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, Regulatory Affairs and Human Capital Management include information common to each of our businesses. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share. \n\n&#160; \n\nBacklog \n\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter's orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage. \n\nMaterials \n\nOur life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nOur research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations. \n\nClimate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense. \n\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we are also committed to sustainability and environmental protection. In 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050. For more information on our approach to sustainability management, refer to our 2021 ESG report, which is available on our website. \n\nRegulatory Affairs \n\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (&#8220;EU IVDR&#8221;), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new \n\n&#160; \n\nregulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022. \n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment. \n\nWe are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. \n\nIn addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR&#8221;), Brazil&#8217;s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados , China's Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. \n\nWhile we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nAs of October 31, 2022, we employed approximately 18,100 persons, of whom approximately 7,000 were based in the Americas, 4,400 in Europe and 6,700 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs. \n\nCulture. Agilent instruments, software, services, solutions and people provide trusted answers to customers&#8217; most challenging questions. Whether we are working with our customers to keep food supplies safe, improve the quality of air, water and soil, or fight cancer with more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments, Agilent employees share a passion and commitment to advancing the quality of life. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to fulfil that commitment. \n\nEngagement. Agilent engages with our employees through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback and reviews. Our executive officers hold all-managers meetings on a quarterly basis to provide business updates and answer questions. We conduct an annual leadership survey that allows employees to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness, culture and job satisfaction. We have an open-door policy where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring issues to management&#8217;s attention. Employees have regular performance reviews with immediate supervisors. Employee sessions are held regularly to share business and market updates and answer employee questions. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion. As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from providing managers transparency of their workforce pay equity to working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds. Agilent is committed to creating a diverse work environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. As of October 31, 2022, approximately 38 percent of our full-time employees were female. Approximately 42 \n\n&#160; \n\npercent of our board is comprised of directors representing underrepresented groups as of the date of this report. We have launched a number of company-wide initiatives including employee-network groups aimed at promoting engagement of traditionally underrepresented groups of employees. \n\nRetention . We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Our benefits are offered to eligible employees and comply with local legal requirements. We have a number of programs and policies designed to help employees in our diverse workforce manage their work and personal lives while meeting company objectives for business success, including flexible work arrangements, health and welfare benefits, employee and family assistance plans and parental leave. \n\nDevelopment . As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development for current and rising managers. Training at Agilent takes several forms: face-to-face classroom experiences, on-the-job learning, virtual classroom events and self-paced e-learning. We are committed to providing an environment in which employees can expand their knowledge, develop new skills, and contribute their best work. Our culture of continuous development instills in our employees the behaviors that bring our values to life every day. We encourage our people to stay up-to-date on current research and technology while enhancing their current skills and growing new skills to meet future needs; we also put special emphasis on training managers at all levels to effectively communicate, role model and reinforce our values and culture. \n\nHealth and Safety. The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us. Our environmental, health and safety management system provides a framework for assessing and managing risks relating to health and safety. We regularly evaluate and review with senior management the performance of our programs and processes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. In the U.S., we enacted safety measures, including social distancing protocols, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, suspending non-essential work travel, implementing various access controls at our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities. As COVID-19 conditions improved, we implemented a phased reopening process and continued to prioritize health and safety. We expect to continue to implement appropriate safety measures as necessary, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. \n\nCommunity . Each year Agilent employees throughout the world devote thousands of volunteer hours to community service activities. Our employees may take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities with charities and organizations. We also support a giving program, which provides employees the opportunity to support a broad range of eligible non-profit organizations in their communities in the areas of health and human services, arts and culture, education and literacy, environment and conservation, and family and civic betterment. \n\nInformation about our Executive Officers \n\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below: \n\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen, 57, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nBusiness and Strategic Risks \n\nT he COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, certain elements of our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. \n\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, sales and delivery and supply chains. Many countries including the United States implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products. Moreover, these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to a mandated shutdown of our facilities in Shanghai, which negatively impacted our business and results, and impacted our supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic also impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. While many of our customers have returned to work and economic activity has ramped up, we are unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, containment measures and additional waves of infection. As COVID-19 conditions improved, there have been increases in demand for certain of our products, which posed challenges to our supply chain. If there are supply shortages or delays and we are not able to meet increasing product demand, our results would be adversely affected. \n\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets. The impact of the pandemic may increase the possibility of uncertainty in the global financial markets, high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results and financial condition even after local conditions improve. There are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. \n\nAs COVID-19 conditions have improved, the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business. The actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information; pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient; and could have a material, adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \n\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth, inflationary pressures, instability and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in: \n\n&#8226; reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations; \n\n&#8226; increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories; \n\n&#8226; increased price pressure for our products and services; and \n\n&#8226; greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio. \n\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. \n\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins. \n\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer. \n\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to: \n\n&#8226; properly identify customer needs and predict future needs; \n\n&#8226; innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; \n\n&#8226; appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects; \n\n&#8226; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; \n\n&#8226; manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time; \n\n&#8226; differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings; \n\n&#8226; price our products competitively; \n\n&#8226; anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and \n\n&#8226; control product quality in our manufacturing process. \n\nIn addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures. \n\n&#160; \n\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income. \n\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses. \n\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies. \n\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer. \n\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel. \n\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees. \n\nEconomic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2022, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 4 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: \n\n&#8226; interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers; \n\n&#8226; ongoing instability or changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine/Russia conflict and political and trade uncertainties in the greater China region; \n\n&#8226; changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, as well as, new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade \n\n&#160; \n\nbarriers; \n\n&#8226; tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods; \n\n&#8226; negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export; \n\n&#8226; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; \n\n&#8226; differing labor regulations; \n\n&#8226; differing protection of intellectual property; \n\n&#8226; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; \n\n&#8226; geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, terrorism and war; and \n\n&#8226; impact of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19 on the global economy. \n\nWe sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nMost of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If economical, political, health or other conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results. \n\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts. \n\nOur strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions. \n\nWe have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition. \n\nOur acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected. \n\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets, and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, \n\n&#160; \n\nconsolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment. \n\nIntegrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks. Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. \n\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions. \n\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted. \n\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business. \n\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us. \n\nRegulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks \n\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price. \n\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. \n\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. \n\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data \n\n&#160; \n\nprivacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR&#8221;), Brazil&#8217;s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China&#8217;s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and when personal data may be transferred outside the country where it was collected. Many such laws impose significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR or orders to stop processing personal data in a particular jurisdiction). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. \n\nWe must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Such laws demand that we implement, test, and monitor an effective compliance program. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. \n\nThese regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer. \n\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed. \n\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities. If we or any of our suppliers, distributors or customers fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services. For example, the EU has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the &#8220;EU IVDR&#8221;), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market \n\n&#160; \n\nsurveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. \n\nSome of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business. \n\nSome of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, storing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance. \n\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations. \n\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer. \n\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. \n\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. \n\nEnvironmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities. \n\nCertain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination. Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled. In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Siemens Healthineers (formerly Varian Medical Systems, Inc.). Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental \n\n&#160; \n\ncontamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters. Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. \n\nOur current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability. Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities. We cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us, our customers or our suppliers. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions, restrictions on our operations and reputational damage. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. \n\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. \n\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all. \n\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. \n\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results. \n\nOur pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. \n\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance. \n\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC and NYSE, as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the U.S. and foreign governments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. The increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us. \n\nOperational Risks \n\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted. \n\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products. \n\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity which could occur due to our plans to expand certain manufacturing capacities, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. \n\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively. \n\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price. \n\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. \n\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other climate-change related risks, including resource scarcity, rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather \n\n&#160; \n\nconditions. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to mandated shutdown of our facilities in Shanghai, which adversely impacted our business and results, and impacted our supply chain. In addition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. In addition, our facilities in California are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought and wildfires. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss. \n\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected. \n\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. For example, in December 2020, it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified an impacted SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents. While we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. \n\nFinancial and Tax Risks \n\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nChanges in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. \n\nWe are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and \n\n&#160; \n\nregulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition. \n\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly. \n\nWe benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives. \n\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. \n\nWe are party to a $1.35 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024 and a $600 million term loan facility that matures on April 15, 2025. Furthermore, we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish incremental facilities of up to $500 million. As of October 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility or the incremental facilities. On June 18, 2021, we increased the maximum amount of our commercial paper program to $1.35 billion. As of October 31, 2022 , we had borrowings of $35 million outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.54 percent. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion in senior unsecured notes and $600 million outstanding under the term loan facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. \n\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things: \n\n&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; \n\n&#8226; requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and \n\n&#8226; limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry. \n\nOur credit facility and our term loan facility each imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. \n\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. \n\nSince the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity. \n\nAs of October 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,053 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions and volatility in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid or hinder our ability to borrow money in the amounts, at interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available under different economic circumstances. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding growth opportunities, including for revenue and our end markets, strength and drivers of the markets into which we sell, sales funnels, our strategic direction, new product and service introductions and the position of our current products and services, market demand for and adoption of our products, the ability of our products and solutions to address customer needs and meet industry requirements, our focus on differentiating our product solutions, improving our customers&#8217; experience and growing our earnings, future financial results, our operating margin, mix, our investments, including in manufacturing infrastructure, research and development and expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolios, expanding our position in developing countries and emerging markets, our focus on balanced capital allocation, our contributions to our pension and other defined benefit plans, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the impact of foreign currency movements, our hedging programs and other actions to offset the effects of tariffs and foreign currency movements, our future effective tax rate, tax valuation allowance and unrecognized tax benefits, the impact of local government regulations on our ability to pay vendors or conduct operations, our ability to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including through cash generated from operations, the potential impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, indemnification, source and supply of materials used in our products, our sales, our purchase commitments, our capital expenditures, the integration and effects of our acquisitions and other transactions, our stock repurchase program and dividends and the potential or anticipated direct or indirect impact of COVID-19 on our business that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Part I Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\n&#160; \n\nOverview and Executive Summary \n\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers. Our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business moved from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. We also moved BioTek's service revenue and related cost of sales from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. We began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2022. Historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes. There was no change to our diagnostics and genomics business segment. \n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic \n\nBoth our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In fiscal 2022, many businesses and countries, including the U.S., continued applying preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. \n\nIn the latter part of our second quarter, we had to shut down our primary gas chromatography production facility and logistics center in Shanghai in compliance with lockdown measures related to COVID-19. We successfully managed the unplanned shutdown of our facility and fully recognized the revenue that was delayed from our second quarter within fiscal year 2022. \n\nWhile conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have improved in 2022 compared to 2021, the pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak, new variants and the contagiousness of these new variants, the effectiveness of health and safety measures including vaccines and therapies, government and community responses including additional lockdowns, the pace and strength of the economic recovery, supply chain pressures, delivery and installation delays due to variable access to customer sites, among others. We will continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impacts to our employees and on our business results. \n\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict \n\nIn response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, at the beginning of March, we suspended sales prohibited by sanctions, halted the shipment of products to Russia with the exception of diagnostics and healthcare products and limited our in-country service to those diagnostics and healthcare customers. Subsequently, effective May 23, 2022, we ceased major operations within Russia, and as a result, we recorded an immaterial expense associated with the shutdown of operations for the three months ended April 30, 2022. For the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, sales derived from customers based in Russia represented an immaterial percentage of our total revenue. \n\nTerm Loan Facility \n\nOn April 15, 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement with a group of financial institutions, which provided for a $600 million delayed draw term loan that will mature on April 15, 2025. As of October 31, 2022, we had $600 million borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.98 percent. Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest, at our option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans or (ii) adjusted term SOFR, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans. The term loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with the covenants for the term loan during the year ended October 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn May 4, 2022, we used the proceeds from the term loan facility and repaid the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. In May 2022, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, $7 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. \n\nActual Results \n\nDuring 2022, we navigated through a challenging environment marked by supply chain and logistics pressures, high inflation, a COVID-related shutdown in China and were able to deliver strong results. Agilent's net revenue of $6,848 million in 2022 increased 8 percent when compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements for 2022 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points when compared to 2021. Net revenue increased in all business segments, geographic regions and most key end markets. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 9 percent in 2022 when compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2022 when compared to 2021. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 7 percent in 2022 when compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2022 when compared to 2021. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 7 percent in 2022 when compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2022 when compared to 2021. \n\nAgilent's net revenue of $6,319 million increased 18 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements for 2021 had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 3 percentage points when compared to 2020. Net revenue increased in all business segments, geographic regions and key end markets compared to 2020. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 18 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2021, acquisitions from 2019 had an overall favorable impact of 7 percentage points when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 3 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020. Revenue in the diagnostics and genomics business increased 24 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 3 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020. Revenue in the Agilent CrossLab business increased 16 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020. \n\nNet income was $1,254 million in 2022 compared to net income of $1,210 million and $719 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net income in 2022 was impacted by higher sales volume partially offset by supply chain, logistics and inflationary pressures increasing our costs. Net income in 2021 was impacted by higher sales volume and net gains on fair value of equity securities partially offset by significant expense increases from our variable pay, share-based compensation expense and sales commissions. Net income in 2020 was impacted by revenue declines in certain of our businesses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs and expenses which included an impairment charge of $98 million related to the closure of our sequencer development program. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,053 million and $1,484 million, respectively. \n\n2019 Repurchase Program. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired 5.2 million shares for $469 million under the 2019 repurchase program authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired 3.1 million shares for $365 million under this authorization. Effective February 18, 2021, the 2019 repurchase program was terminated and replaced by the 2021 repurchase program. The remaining authorization under the 2019 repurchase plan of $193 million expired on February 18, 2021. \n\n2021 Repurchase Program. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired 3.0 million shares for $423 million under the 2021 repurchase program authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2022, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for $1,139 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2022, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $438 million of our common stock under the 2021 repurchase program. \n\nDividends. During the year ended October 31, 2022, cash dividends of $0.840 per share, or $250 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2021, cash dividends of $0.776 per share, or $236 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2020, cash dividends of $0.720 per share, or $222 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn November 16, 2022 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share of common stock, or approximately $66 million which will be paid on January 25, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2023. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. \n\nLooking forward, we remain focused on improving our customers&#8217; experience, differentiating product solutions and productivity. We expect to face continued inflationary and logistical pressures (such as longer lead times and limited sources of supply in the near term) which we will continue to mitigate through targeted pricing and various sourcing strategies. While we anticipate an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal year 2023, we remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in all of our key end markets in fiscal year 2023. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes. \n\nRevenue Recognition . We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time. \n\nWe derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (&#8220;ASC 606&#8217;&#8217;). Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. For products that transfer control over time, revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. Product over time revenue is assessed against the following criteria: the performance creates an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created; the asset has no alternative use; and we have an enforceable right to payment. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded. \n\nService revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. \n\nWe have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue. \n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract, and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations. \n\nA portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\") beginning in 2020 and ASC 840, Leases (\"ASC 840\") for prior periods. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the consumables, the non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard. \n\nInventory Valuation. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. \n\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. \n\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2022 and 2021, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2022, discount rates for the U.S. pension and retiree medical plans increased compared to the previous year due to the increase in the corporate bond rates. For 2022 and 2021, the discount rates for non-U.S. plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2022, increased compared to the previous year. If we had changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would have been approximately $3 million on U.S. pension expense and $16 million on non-U.S. pension expense for the year ended October 31, 2022. Lower discount rates usually increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates usually decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense. \n\nThe company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. \n\nIn the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans were approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of October 31, 2022. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan \n\n&#160; \n\ntarget asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 15 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 30 percent to 80 percent to fixed income investments, from zero to 25 percent to real estate and from zero to 55 percent to annuity contracts, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity and bond markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2022, may differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation. \n\nEquity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. The annuity contract is an insurance buy-in contract issued by a third-party insurance company for a portion of benefit obligations of listed pensioners under the U.K. defined benefit plan, and is funded with existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations. Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trusts and other similar real estate investments. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. \n\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we had changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would have been $6 million on U.S. pension expense and $10 million on non-U.S. pension expense for the year ended October 31, 2022. The total periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $2 million benefit in 2022, $24 million expense in 2021 and $22 million expense in 2020. These costs included a loss on settlement of $4 million, $1 million and $4 million, for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. \n\nThe guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. \n\nIf it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. \n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of November 1, 2021, due to the change in our segment structure. As of November 1, 2021, there was no impairment of goodwill. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2022, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nPurchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development (\"IPR&#38;D\") \n\n&#160; \n\nacquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR&#38;D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&#38;D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&#38;D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. \n\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. \n\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&#38;D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2022. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. \n\nAccounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. \n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nAdoption of New Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities and equity are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2022, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 4 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2021, had an overall favorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points when compared to 2020. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling thirteen-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction. \n\n&#160; \n\nResults from Operations \n\nNet Revenue \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, 2022 over 2021 Change 2021 over 2020 Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) &#160; &#160; Net revenue: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Products $ 5,187 $ 4,756 $ 3,993 9% 19% Services and other $ 1,661 $ 1,563 $ 1,346 6% 16% Total net revenue $ 6,848 $ 6,319 $ 5,339 8% 18% ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, 2022 over 2021 Change 2021 over 2020 Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 % of total net revenue: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Products 76 % 75 % 75 % 1 ppt. &#8212; Services and other 24 % 25 % 25 % (1) ppt. &#8212; Total 100 % 100 % 100 % &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAgilent's net revenue of $6,848 million for the year ended October 31, 2022, increased 8 percent when compared to 2021.

Total gross margin for the year ended October 31, 2021 increased 1 percentage point when compared to 2020. Total gross margin increased due to higher sales volume and favorable product mix which was partially offset by higher wages and variable pay, higher shipping and logistics costs, higher intangible amortization expense and higher share-based compensation expense. \n\nGross inventory charges were $24 million in 2022, $29 million in 2021 and $28 million in 2020. Sales of previously written down inventory were $11 million in 2022, $8 million in 2021 and $7 million in 2020. \n\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended October 31, 2022 increased 6 percent when compared to 2021. Research and development expenses increased due to higher wages and program investments in our diagnostics and genomics segment and in our mass spectrometry business within our our life sciences and applied markets segment, and additional research and development expenses related to the Resolution Bioscience acquisition. Research and development expenses for the year ended October 31, 2021 decreased 11 percent when compared to 2020. Excluding the intangible and other assets impairments recorded in 2020, research and development expenses for the year ended October 31, 2021 increased 11 percent due to increased wages and variable pay, higher program investments in our life sciences and applied markets and diagnostics and genomics businesses, additional expenses related to an acquisition, and higher share-based compensation expense. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2022 when compared to 2021. The increase was due to higher wages, share-based compensation expense and inflationary pressures mostly offset by lower commissions, acquisition and integration costs, variable pay, transformational initiatives and a decrease related to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8 percent in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to higher wages and variable pay, higher commissions and higher share-based compensation expense partially offset by a decrease related to the change in the fair value of an acquisition-related contingent consideration, lower legal costs and lower transformational initiatives expenses. \n\nTotal operating margin for the year ended October 31, 2022 increased 2 percentage points when compared to 2021. Operating margin increased due to higher sales volume, increased gross margin, lower commissions and variable pay partially offset by increases in wages, share-based compensation expense and inflationary pressures. Total operating margin for the year ended October 31, 2021, increased 6 percentage points when compared to 2020. Operating margin increased due to higher sales volume and increased gross margin partially offset by increases in wages and variable pay, commissions, share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. \n\nInterest income for the year ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $9 million, $2 million and $8 million, respectively. The increase in interest income in 2022 was primarily due to increases in interest rates for our cash and cash equivalents. \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $84 million, $81 million and $78 million, respectively, and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes, term loan, credit facilities, commercial paper and the amortization of the deferred loss recorded upon termination of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts partially offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon termination of interest rate swap contracts. \n\nAt October 31, 2022, our headcount was approximately 18,100 compared to 17,000 in 2021. \n\nOther income (expense), net \n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, other income (expense), net includes income of $11 million related to the provision of site service costs to, and lease income from, Keysight Technologies, Inc.

For the year ended October 31, 2022, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the tax benefit of $46 million related to foreign-derived intangible income. \n\nFor 2021, our income tax expense was $150 million with an effective tax rate of 11 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2021, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the discrete benefit of $93 million related to the release of tax reserves in various jurisdictions due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021, also include the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $29 million. \n\nFor 2020, our income tax expense was $123 million with an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates. \n\nWe have negotiated a tax holiday in Singapore. The tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. As a result of the incentive, the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by $53 million, $35 million, and $71 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.18, $0.11, and $0.23 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nWith these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. \n\nSegment Overview \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers. Our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business moved from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. We also moved BioTek's service revenue and related cost of sales from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. Following this reorganization, we continue to have three business segments (life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab), each of which continues to comprise a reportable segment. We began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2022. Historical financial segment information have been recast to conform to this new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes. There was no change to our diagnostics and genomics business segment. \n\nThrough October 31, 2022, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business. \n\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets \n\nOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (\"LC\") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (\"LCMS\") systems; gas chromatography (\"GC\") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (\"GCMS\") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") instruments; atomic absorption (\"AA\") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (\"MP-AES\") instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (\"ICP-OES\") instruments; raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer; cell imaging systems; microplate reader; laboratory software for sample tracking; information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies. Our consumables portfolio is designed to improve customer outcomes. Most of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices. Solutions range from chemistries to supplies. Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Revenue \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, 2022 over 2021 Change 2021 over 2020 Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) &#160; &#160; Net revenue $ 4,007 $ 3,663 $ 3,115 9% 18% ##TABLE_END\n\nLife science and applied markets business revenue in 2022 increased 9 percent compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2022 when compared to the same period last year.

We paid interest semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year and payments commenced January 15, 2014. \n\nOn May 4, 2022, we used the proceeds from the term loan facility and repaid the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. In May 2022, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, $7 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. \n\n2026 Senior Notes \n\nOn September 22, 2016, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $300 million in senior notes (\"2026 senior notes\"). The 2026 senior notes were issued at 99.624% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 22, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.05% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 22nd and September 22nd of each year and payments commenced March 22, 2017. \n\nIn February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2022 was $4 million. \n\n2029 Senior Notes \n\nOn September 16, 2019, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (\"2029 senior notes\"). The 2029 senior notes were issued at 99.316% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 15, 2029, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.75% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th of each year and payments commenced on March 15, 2020. \n\nIn August 2019, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $250 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2029 senior notes issued on September 16, 2019. We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 6, 2019 and we recognized a deferred loss of $6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2029 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2022 was $4 million. \n\n2030 Senior Notes \n\nOn June 4, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes (\"2030 senior notes\"). The 2030 senior notes were issued at 99.812% of their principal amount. The 2030 senior notes will mature on June 4, 2030, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.10% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on June 4th and December 4th of each year and payments commenced on December 4, 2020. \n\n2031 Senior Notes \n\nOn March 12, 2021, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $850 million in senior notes (\"2031 senior notes\"). The 2031 senior notes were issued at 99.822% of their principal amount. The 2031 senior notes will mature on March 12, 2031, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.30% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 12th and September 12th of each year and payments commenced on September 12, 2021. \n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other \n\nOur liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. \n\nContractual Commitments \n\nOur cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors. \n\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2022, for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers $ 1,027 $ 16 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; Other purchase commitments 139 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Retirement plans 16 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total $ 1,182 $ 16 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nCommitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our \n\nbusiness needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year. \n\nOther Purchase Commitments. We have categorized \"other purchase commitments\" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under \"other purchase commitments\" were approximately $139 million. \n\nRetirement Plans. Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2022, we provided an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen. \n\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2022, or October 31, 2021. \n\nOn Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nThe following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2022 balance sheet (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Senior notes $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 300 $ 1,850 Term Loan &#8212; 600 &#8212; &#8212; Commercial paper 35 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Interest expense 80 146 97 127 Transition tax 7 68 49 &#8212; Operating leases 53 56 18 40 Total $ 175 $ 870 $ 464 $ 2,017 ##TABLE_END\n\nOther long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021 include $216 million and $241 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, $99 million and $117 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. As of October 31, 2022, the remaining $117 million included in other long-term liabilities relates to the U.S. transition tax payment which is due in installments over the next four years. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities and equity denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is mainly managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, including option and forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction. \n\nOur operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenues, third party vendor payments and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market, we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk. Approximately 56 percent of our revenue in 2022, 53 percent of our revenue in 2021 and 52 percent of our revenue in 2020 was generated in U.S. dollars. The overall unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. \n\ndollar, has decreased revenue by approximately 4 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2022. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. \n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, statement of comprehensive income or cash flows. \n\nWe are also exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between the interest expense we pay on our loans at fixed rates and the variable rates of interest we receive from cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. We have issued long-term debt in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies at fixed interest rates based on the market conditions at the time of financing. We believe that the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes when the underlying market rates of interest change, and we may use interest rate swaps to modify such market risk. \n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates relating to the underlying fair value of our fixed rate debt. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in interest rates would result in an immaterial impact to the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt. \n\n"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \n\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nAs described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $144 million as of October 31, 2022. As disclosed by management, the estimate of the Company&#8217;s tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions requires management to assess uncertainties and to make judgments about the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various other foreign jurisdictions and is subject to examinations of its tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. The Company has a number of years and matters which remain subject to examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions that could result in significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining uncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the numerous and complex tax laws, tax audits, and potential for significant adjustments as a result of such audits. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate the timely identification and accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions is complex and required significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often highly subjective. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liability for uncertain tax positions, and controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the liability. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of information used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including intercompany agreements, international, federal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax returns, testing the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions by jurisdiction, including management&#8217;s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained, testing the completeness of management&#8217;s assessment of both the identification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes of each uncertain tax position, and evaluating the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nSan Jose, California \n\nDecember 20, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1999. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nOverview. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. \n\nNew Segment Structure. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers. Our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business moved from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. We also moved BioTek's service revenue and related cost of sales from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. Following this reorganization, we continue to have three business segments (life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab), each of which continues to comprise a reportable segment. We began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2022. Historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes. There was no change to our diagnostics and genomics business segment. \n\nBasis of Presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \n\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions and accounting for income taxes. \n\nRisks and Uncertainties. We are subject to risks common to companies in the analytical instrument industry, such as global economic and financial market conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in customer demand, among others. \n\nBoth our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. The global supply chain and logistics pressures, high inflation, and COVID-related shutdowns in China have made it more challenging for companies to manage operations. We cannot provide any assurances that any prolonged material disruptions in the supply chain will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of October 31, 2022, our consolidated financial statements have not been materially impacted. \n\nRevenue Recognition. &#160; We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time. \n\nWe derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , (&#8220;ASC 606&#8217;&#8217;). See also Note 3, \"Revenue\" for additional information on revenue recognition. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. For products that transfer control over time, revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. Product over time revenue is assessed against the following criteria: the performance creates an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created; the asset has no alternative use; and we have an enforceable right to payment. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded. \n\nService revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. \n\nWe have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis. \n\nOur multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue. \n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Standalone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract, and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations. \n\nA portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases beginning in 2020 and ASC 840, Leases for prior periods. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. \n\nDeferred Revenue. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements (performance obligations) to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either in current liabilities in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation. \n\nSales Taxes. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenue. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nShipping and Handling Costs. Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented. \n\nResearch and Development. Costs related to research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred. \n\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and amounted to $ 66 million in 2022, $ 63 million in 2021 and $ 48 million in 2020. \n\nTaxes on Income. Income tax expense or benefit is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. See Note 5, \"Income Taxes\" for more information. \n\nNet Income Per Share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income - the numerator - by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding - the denominator - during the period excluding the dilutive effect of stock options and other employee stock plans. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potential common shares outstanding during the period unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. See Note 6, \"Net Income Per Share\". \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments. We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original or remaining maturity is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. \n\nAs of October 31, 2022, approximately $ 1,028 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our funds. \n\nWe classify equity investments as short-term investments based on their nature and our intent and ability to exit within a year or less. As of October 31, 2022, we had no short-term investments. \n\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash to the consolidated balance sheet follows: \n\n##TABLE_START October 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,053 &#160; $ 1,484 &#160; $ 1,441 &#160; Restricted cash included in other assets 3 &#160; 6 &#160; 6 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 1,056 &#160; $ 1,490 &#160; $ 1,447 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAccounts Receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was not material. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers. Accounts receivable are also recorded net of estimated product returns which are not material. \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Agilent to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, equity investments with readily determinable fair value securities, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments. In \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\naddition, Agilent has credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis. \n\nCredit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount, and we sell the majority of our products through our direct sales force. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral such as letter of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of accounts receivable as of October 31, 2022, or 2021. \n\nInventory. Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease and machinery and equipment over 3 years to 10 years. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets. \n\nCapitalized Software. We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software. Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over 3 years to 5 years once development is complete. \n\nLeases. We determine whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Prior to November 1, 2019, for leases where we are the lessee, we accounted for operating lease payments by charging them to expense as incurred. At the beginning of fiscal 2020, the company adopted new lease accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"). The most significant change requires lessees to record the present value of operating lease payments as right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Where we are the lessee, ROU assets represent the company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Classification of operating lease liabilities as either current or non-current is based on the expected timing of payments due under our obligations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. In order to determine the appropriate incremental borrowing rates, we have used a number of factors including the company's credit rating, the lease term and the currency swap rate. The ROU asset also consists of any lease incentives received. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for operating leases with an initial term of more than twelve months is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. We have lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-lease components. We have elected to account for these payments as a single lease component. \n\nA portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements where Agilent is the lessor. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue Contracts with Customers, and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the consumables, the non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard. \n\nSee also Note 9, \"Leases\" for additional information about our leases. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nAcquisitions. Agilent accounts for the acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, and we allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (&#8220;IPR&#38;D&#8221;), based on their estimated fair values. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The fair value of IPR&#38;D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When an IPR&#38;D project is completed, the IPR&#38;D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life. \n\nOur determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and IPR&#38;D acquired involve significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. \n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. \n\nThe guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. \n\nIf it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. \n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of November 1, 2021, due to the change in our segment structure. As of November 1, 2021, there was no impairment of goodwill. We also performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of September 30, 2022, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nPurchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. IPR&#38;D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&#38;D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&#38;D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. \n\nAgilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&#38;D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nsignificant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2022. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $ 90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During the year ended October 31, 2022, there were no impairments of other long-lived assets or intangible assets. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we recorded an impairment charge of long-lived assets of $ 2 million. During the year ended October 31, 2020 we recorded an impairment charge of long-lived assets including indefinite-lived in-process research and development of $ 98 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. \n\nVariable Interest Entities. We make a determination upon entering into an arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;). We evaluate our investments in privately held companies on an ongoing basis. We have determined that as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no VIEs required to be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements because we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the VIEs in which we have invested nor are we the primary beneficiary. We account for these investments under either the equity method or as equity investments without readily determinable fair value, depending on the circumstances. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs and vice-versa, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure. \n\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the total carrying value of investments and loans in privately held companies considered as VIEs was $ 87 million and $ 76 million respectively. The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value because we do not have future funding commitments. The investments are included on the long-term investments line and the loans on the other current assets and other assets lines (depending upon tenure of loan) on the consolidated balance sheet. \n\nInvestments. &#160; Equity investments without readily determinable fair value consist of non-marketable equity securities (typically investments in privately-held companies). These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost, and we adjust for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) included in net income as and when it occurs. Equity investments with readily determinable fair value consist of marketable equity securities which were reclassified from non-marketable equity securities following the commencement of public market trading of the issuers and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. There are no equity investments with readily determinable fair value at October 31, 2022 and $ 91 million at October 31, 2021 . Other investments with readily determinable fair value consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Trading securities, which are comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments and deferred compensation liabilities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Equity method investments are reported at the amount of the company&#8217;s initial investment and adjusted each period for the company&#8217;s share of the investee&#8217;s income or loss and dividend paid. There are no equity method investments as of October 31, 2022 and 2021. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of short-term and long-term equity investments which are readily determinable, and which are not accounted under the equity method are reported at fair value using quoted market prices for those securities \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nwhen available with gains and losses included in net income. The fair value of long-term equity investments which are not readily determinable, and which are not accounted under the equity method are reported at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments included in net income. As of October 31, 2022, the fair value of the term loans approximates its carrying value, and the fair value of our senior notes was $ 1,754 million with a carrying value of $ 2,133 million. This compares to the fair value of our senior notes of $ 2,806 million with a carrying value of $ 2,729 million as of October 31, 2021. The change in the fair value compared to carrying value in the year ended October 31, 2022, is primarily due to increased market interest rates. The fair value was calculated from quoted prices which are primarily Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 12, \"Fair Value Measurements\" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments. \n\nWarranty. Our standard warranty terms typically extend for one year from the date of delivery. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost over the period. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time products are sold. See Note 15, \"Guarantees\". \n\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits. Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are accounted for within employee compensation and benefits. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $ 123 million and $ 129 million as of October 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Plans. Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees. Assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and the expense for these plans are derived annually. See Note 14, &#8220;Retirement plans and post-retirement pension plans&#8221; for additional information. \n\nRetirement of Treasury Shares. Upon the formal retirement of treasury shares, we deduct the par value of the retired treasury shares from common stock and allocate the excess of cost over par as a deduction to additional paid-in capital, based on the pro-rata portion of additional paid-in-capital, and the remaining excess as a deduction to retained earnings. All retired treasury shares revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares. \n\nShare-Based Compensation. For the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, we accounted for share-based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock option awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchases made under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") and performance share awards under Agilent Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance Program (\"LTPP\") using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting. Under the fair value method, we recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $ 126 million in 2022, $ 111 million in 2021 and $ 84 million in 2020. See Note 4, \"Share-based Compensation\" for additional information. \n\nDerivative Instruments. Agilent is exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate locks to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In the vast majority of cases, these contracts are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency or interest exposures. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. Interest rate exposures are associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. To qualify for hedge accounting, contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies. Foreign exchange hedging contracts generally mature within twelve months, interest rate swaps mature at the same time as the maturity of the debt and interest rate locks mature at the same time as the issuance of debt. In order to manage foreign currency exposures in a few limited jurisdictions, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. In such circumstances, the local foreign currency exposure is offset by contracts owned by the parent company. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) - translation adjustment. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nreclassified and recognized in income when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecasted transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and changes in the fair values are recorded in the income statement in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed gross in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the current period. The impact of the ineffectiveness measurement in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was not material. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities. \n\nForeign Currency Translation. We translate and remeasure balance sheet and income statement items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates which approximate to average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. \n\nFor those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in consolidated net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, including hedging gains and losses, are reported in other income (expense), net and were $ 6 million loss for 2022, $ 4 million loss for 2021 and $ 4 million loss for 2020. \n\n2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn January 2020, accounting guidance was issued that clarifies the accounting guidance for equity method investments, joint ventures, and derivatives and hedging. The guidance clarifies the interaction between different sections of the accounting guidance that could be applicable and helps clarify which guidance should be applied in certain situations which increases relevance and comparability of financial statement information. On November 1, 2021, we adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued an update to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The amendments require an acquirer to use the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than using fair value, when recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities related to customer contracts assumed in a business combination. On November 1, 2021 we early adopted this guidance which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued updates to increase the transparency in the annual disclosure requirements relating to government assistance received by business entities in Topic 832, Government Assistance. The guidance requires certain disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model. These amendments are effective for us beginning November 1, 2022, and for interim periods within that year. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. \n\nOther amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\n3. REVENUE \n\nThe following table presents the company&#8217;s total revenue and segment revenue disaggregated by geographical region: \n\n##TABLE_START Life Sciences and Applied Markets Agilent CrossLab Diagnostics and Genomics Total (in millions) Year Ended October 31, 2022: Americas $ 1,331 &#160; $ 567 &#160; $ 784 &#160; $ 2,682 &#160; Europe 907 &#160; 382 &#160; 410 &#160; 1,699 &#160; Asia Pacific 1,769 &#160; 503 &#160; 195 &#160; 2,467 &#160; Total $ 4,007 &#160; $ 1,452 &#160; $ 1,389 &#160; $ 6,848 &#160; Year Ended October 31, 2021: Americas $ 1,199 &#160; $ 510 &#160; $ 695 &#160; $ 2,404 &#160; Europe 893 &#160; 378 &#160; 417 &#160; 1,688 &#160; Asia Pacific 1,571 &#160; 472 &#160; 184 &#160; 2,227 &#160; Total $ 3,663 &#160; $ 1,360 &#160; $ 1,296 &#160; $ 6,319 &#160; Year Ended October 31, 2020: Americas $ 1,002 &#160; $ 449 &#160; $ 517 &#160; $ 1,968 &#160; Europe 746 &#160; 326 &#160; 371 &#160; 1,443 &#160; Asia Pacific 1,367 &#160; 402 &#160; 159 &#160; 1,928 &#160; Total $ 3,115 &#160; $ 1,177 &#160; $ 1,047 &#160; $ 5,339 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the company&#8217;s total revenue disaggregated by end markets and by revenue type: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Revenue by End Markets Pharmaceutical and Biopharmaceutical $ 2,515 &#160; 2,224 &#160; $ 1,754 &#160; Chemicals and Advanced Materials 1,521 &#160; 1,328 &#160; 1,154 &#160; Diagnostics and Clinical 963 &#160; 938 &#160; 787 &#160; Food 617 &#160; 601 &#160; 517 &#160; Academia and Government 576 &#160; 576 &#160; 526 &#160; Environmental and Forensics 656 &#160; 652 &#160; 601 &#160; Total $ 6,848 &#160; $ 6,319 &#160; $ 5,339 &#160; Revenue by Type Instrumentation $ 2,907 &#160; 2,657 &#160; $ 2,249 &#160; Non-instrumentation and other 3,941 &#160; 3,662 &#160; 3,090 &#160; Total $ 6,848 &#160; $ 6,319 &#160; $ 5,339 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue by region is based on the ship to location of the customer. Revenue by end market is determined by the market indicator of the customer and by customer type. Instrumentation revenue includes sales from instruments, remarketed instruments and third-party products. Non-instrumentation and other revenue include sales from contract and per incident services, our companion diagnostics and our nucleic acid solutions businesses as well as sales from spare parts, consumables, reagents, vacuum pumps, subscriptions, software licenses and associated services. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nContract Balances \n\nContract Assets \n\nContract assets (unbilled accounts receivable) primarily relate to the company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The unbilled receivables are reclassified to trade receivables when billed to customers. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets and are included in \"Accounts receivable, net\" in the consolidated balance sheet. The balances of contract assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, were $ 275 million and $ 197 million, respectively. \n\nContract Liabilities \n\nThe following table provides information about contract liabilities (deferred revenue) and the significant changes in the balances during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Contract Liabilities (in millions) Ending balance as of October 31, 2020 $ 446 &#160; Net revenue deferred in the period 406 &#160; Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period ( 359 ) Change in deferrals from customer cash advances, net of revenue recognized 24 &#160; Currency translation and other adjustments 2 &#160; Ending balance as of October 31, 2021 $ 519 &#160; Net revenue deferred in the period 437 &#160; Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period ( 372 ) Change in deferrals from customer cash advances, net of revenue recognized 11 &#160; Currency translation and other adjustments ( 38 ) Ending balance as of October 31, 2022 $ 557 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nContract liabilities primarily relate to multiple element arrangements for which billing has occurred but transfer of control of all elements to the customer has either partially or not occurred at the balance sheet date. This includes cash received from customers for products and related installation and services in advance of the transfer of control. Contract liabilities are classified as either current in deferred revenue or long-term in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when we expect to complete our performance obligation. \n\nContract Costs \n\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognized as an asset if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. The changes in total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 and are included in other current and long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We have applied the practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include the company's internal sales force compensation program, as we have determined that annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. \n\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations \n\nWe have applied the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and have not disclosed information about transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nThe estimated revenue expected to be recognized for remaining performance obligations that have an original term of more than one year, as of October 31, 2022, was $ 357 million, the majority of which is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligations primarily include extended warranty, customer manufacturing contracts, and software maintenance contracts and revenue associated with lease arrangements. \n\n4. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nAgilent accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors including restricted stock units, employee stock options, employee stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the long-term performance plan (\"LTPP\") based on estimated fair values. \n\nDescription of Share-Based Plans \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan. Effective May 1, 2020, we adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") which replaced our previous Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at purchase date. There are 31 million shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP. \n\nUnder our ESPP, employees purchased 469,701 shares for $ 54 million in 2022, 462,237 shares for $ 46 million in 2021 and 628,644 shares for $ 41 million in 2020. As of October 31, 2022, the number of shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 24,859,446 . This excludes the number of shares of common stock to be issued to participants in consideration of the aggregate participant contributions totaling $ 27 million as of October 31, 2022. \n\nIncentive Compensation Plans. On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the \"2018 Plan\") which amends, including renaming and extending the term of, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the \"2009 Plan\"). The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2018 Plan has a term of ten years . As of October 31, 2022, 21,496,468 shares were available for future awards under the 2018 Plan. \n\nStock Options. In fiscal year 2021, we resumed granting stock options. Stock options granted under the 2018 Plan may be either \"incentive stock options\", as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years . The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted. We issue new shares of common stock when employee stock options are exercised. \n\nPerformance Shares. We have two LTPP performance stock award programs, which are administered under the 2018 Stock Plan, for our executive officers and other key employees. Participants in our LTPP Total Stockholders&#8217; Return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) and LTPP Earnings Per Share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) programs are entitled to receive shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year period, if specified performance targets for the programs are met. The LTPP-TSR awards are generally designed to meet the criteria of a performance award with the performance metrics and peer group comparison based on the TSR set at the beginning of the performance period. The LTPP-EPS awards are based on the company&#8217;s EPS performance over a three-year period. The performance targets for the LTPP-EPS for year 2 and year 3 of the performance period are set in the first quarter of year 2 and year 3, respectively. All LTPP awards are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period. The final LTPP award may vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award. The maximum contractual term for awards under the LTPP program is three years . We consider the dilutive impact of these programs in our diluted net income per share calculation only to the extent that the performance conditions are expected to be met. \n\nRestricted Stock Units. We also issue restricted stock units under our share-based plans. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the Stock Plans is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. Restricted stock units generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted to our executives after November 1, 2015, are subject to a one-year post-vest holding period. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nImpact of Share-based Compensation Awards \n\nWe have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method under the authoritative guidance. For all share-based awards we have recognized compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the guidance requires that share-based compensation expense should be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. \n\nThe impact on our results for share-based compensation was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Cost of products and services $ 30 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 21 &#160; Research and development 14 &#160; 12 &#160; 9 &#160; Selling, general and administrative 82 &#160; 73 &#160; 54 &#160; Total share-based compensation expense $ 126 &#160; $ 111 &#160; $ 84 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, no share-based compensation was capitalized within inventory. \n\nValuation Assumptions \n\nThe fair value of share-based awards for our employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Shares granted under the LTPP (TSR) were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For the volatility of our LTPP (TSR) grants, we used our own historical stock price volatility. \n\nThe ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the price at purchase and uses the purchase date to establish the fair market value. \n\nWe use historical volatility to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards. In reaching the conclusion, we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing. In estimating the expected life of our options granted, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executives, which we believe is representative of future behavior. \n\nThe estimated fair value of restricted stock units and LTPP (EPS) awards is determined based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The compensation cost for LTPP (EPS) reflects the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. \n\nAll LTPP awards granted to our senior management employees have a one-year post-vest holding restriction. The estimated discount associated with post-vest holding restrictions is calculated using the Finnerty model. The model calculates the potential lost value if the employees were able to sell the shares during the lack of marketability period, instead of being required to hold the shares. The model used the same historical stock price volatility and dividend yield assumption used for the Monte Carlo simulation model and an expected dividend yield to compute the discount. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nThe following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of awards granted. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Stock Option Plan: Weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.5 % 0.5 % &#8212; Dividend yield 0.5 % 0.7 % &#8212; Weighted average volatility 26 % 26 % &#8212; Expected life 5.5 years 5.5 years &#8212; LTPP: &#160; &#160; &#160; Volatility of Agilent shares 29 % 30 % 23 % Volatility of selected peer-company shares 23 %- 81 % \n\n24 %- 57 % \n\n15 %- 44 % \n\nPair-wise correlation with selected peers 41 % 45 % 29 % Post-vest restriction discount for all executive awards 6.5 % 6.8 % 5.3 % ##TABLE_END\n\nShare-Based Payment Award Activity \n\nEmployee Stock Options \n\nThe following table summarizes employee stock option award activity of our employees and directors for 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Options Outstanding Weighted Average Exercise Price &#160; (in thousands) &#160; Outstanding at October 31, 2021 943 &#160; $ 69 &#160; Granted 279 &#160; $ 158 &#160; Exercised ( 108 ) $ 38 &#160; Cancelled ( 17 ) $ 130 &#160; Outstanding at October 31, 2022 1,097 &#160; $ 94 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe options outstanding and exercisable for equity share-based payment awards at October 31, 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices Number Outstanding Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Number Exercisable Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value &#160; (in thousands) (in years) &#160; (in thousands) (in thousands) (in years) &#160; (in thousands) \n\n$ 25.00 &#160;- $ 40.00 \n\n69 &#160; 1.0 $ 38 &#160; $ 6,958 &#160; 69 &#160; 1.0 $ 38 &#160; $ 6,958 &#160; \n\n$ 40.01 &#160;- $ 50.00 \n\n386 &#160; 2.0 $ 41 &#160; 37,556 &#160; 386 &#160; 2.0 $ 41 &#160; 37,556 &#160; \n\n$ 100.00 - $ 110.00 \n\n325 &#160; 8.0 $ 110 &#160; 9,254 &#160; 90 &#160; 8.0 $ 110 &#160; 2,555 &#160; \n\n$ 110.01 - $ 150.00 \n\n65 &#160; 8.9 $ 128 &#160; 687 &#160; 9 &#160; 8.5 $ 127 &#160; 99 &#160; \n\n$ 150.01 &#38; Over \n\n252 &#160; 9.0 $ 161 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; 9.0 $ 159 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,097 &#160; 5.8 $ 94 &#160; $ 54,455 &#160; 560 &#160; 3.1 $ 54 &#160; $ 47,168 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the company's closing stock price of $ 138.35 at October 31, 2022, which would have been received by award holders had all award holders exercised their awards that were in-the-money as of that date.

For the year ended October 31, 2022, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the tax benefit of $ 46 million related to foreign-derived intangible income. \n\nFor 2021, our income tax expense was $ 150 million with an effective tax rate of 11 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2021, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the discrete benefit of $ 93 million related to the release of tax reserves in various jurisdictions due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021 also include the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $ 29 million. \n\nFor 2020, our income tax expense was $ 123 million with an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates. \n\nWe have negotiated a tax holiday in Singapore. The tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. As a result of the incentive, the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by $ 53 million, $ 35 million, and $ 71 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $ 0.18 , $ 0.11 , and $ 0.23 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; (in millions) Deferred Tax Assets Intangibles $ 62 &#160; $ 72 &#160; Employee benefits, other than retirement 45 &#160; 43 &#160; Net operating loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards 157 &#160; 191 &#160; Share-based compensation 23 &#160; 22 &#160; Lease obligations 29 &#160; 30 &#160; Other 58 &#160; 42 &#160; Deferred tax assets $ 374 &#160; $ 400 &#160; Tax valuation allowance ( 115 ) ( 120 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 259 &#160; $ 280 &#160; Deferred Tax Liabilities Property, plant and equipment $ ( 11 ) $ ( 11 ) Pension benefits and retiree medical benefits ( 24 ) ( 8 ) Right-of-use asset ( 29 ) ( 29 ) Other ( 7 ) ( 26 ) Deferred tax liabilities $ ( 71 ) $ ( 74 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 188 &#160; $ 206 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nValuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. As of October 31, 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $ 115 million until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal. The valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred tax assets for the states of California and Colorado, along with the net operating losses in the Netherlands and capital losses in Australia. \n\nAt October 31, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 6 million, $ 207 million and $ 384 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023. If not utilized, $ 3 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023. The remaining $ 381 million of the foreign net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2022, we had foreign capital loss carryforwards of $ 108 million. The foreign capital losses carry forward indefinitely. At October 31, 2022, we had state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 87 million. The state tax credits carry forward indefinitely. \n\nThe breakdown between long-term deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; (in millions) Long-term deferred tax assets (included within other assets) $ 246 &#160; $ 309 &#160; Long-term deferred tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities) ( 58 ) ( 103 ) Total $ 188 &#160; $ 206 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nThe breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START October 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Current income tax assets (included within other current assets) $ 87 &#160; $ 66 &#160; Long-term income tax assets (included within other assets) 11 &#160; 6 &#160; Current income tax liabilities (included within other accrued liabilities) ( 51 ) ( 47 ) Long-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities) ( 216 ) ( 241 ) Total $ ( 169 ) $ ( 216 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe aggregate changes in the balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Balance, beginning of year $ 133 &#160; $ 195 &#160; $ 206 &#160; Additions for tax positions related to the current year 5 &#160; 6 &#160; 6 &#160; Additions for tax positions from prior years &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Reductions for tax positions from prior years ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Settlements with taxing authorities &#8212; &#160; ( 30 ) &#8212; &#160; Statute of limitations expirations ( 6 ) ( 42 ) ( 17 ) Balance, end of year $ 123 &#160; $ 133 &#160; $ 195 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of October 31, 2022, we had $ 144 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties of which $ 121 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. However, approximately $ 23 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions that, if recognized, would be in the form of a deferred tax asset that would likely not affect our effective tax rate due to a valuation allowance. \n\nWe recognized tax benefit of $ 2 million in 2022, tax benefit of $ 19 million in 2021, and tax expense of $ 8 million in 2020, for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. Interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 21 million and $ 26 million, respectively. \n\nIn the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2018 for federal income tax purposes and for significant states. In other major jurisdictions where we conduct business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2012. \n\nWith these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\n6. NET INCOME PER SHARE \n\nThe following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Numerator: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net income $ 1,254 &#160; $ 1,210 &#160; $ 719 &#160; Denominators: &#160; &#160; &#160; Basic weighted average shares 299 &#160; 304 &#160; 309 &#160; Potential common shares &#8212; stock options and other employee stock plans 1 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; Diluted weighted average shares 300 &#160; 307 &#160; 312 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested restricted stock units. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense collectively are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. An increase in the fair market value of the company's common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive awards. \n\nWe exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, we exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, stock options, ESPP, LTPP and restricted stock awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive. \n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, we issued share-based awards of approximately 1.4 million, 2.1 million and 2.4 million, respectively. For the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, the impacts of the anti-dilutive potential common shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share were not material. \n\n7.

LEASES \n\nAs a lessee, we have various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for office space, warehouses, distribution centers, research and development facilities, manufacturing and production locations as well as vehicles, personal computers and other equipment. Our real estate leases have remaining lease terms of one to thirty years, which represent the non-cancelable periods of the leases and include extension options that we determined are reasonably certain to be exercised. We exclude options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised from our lease terms, ranging from six months to twenty years. Our lease payments consist primarily of fixed rental payments for the right to use the underlying leased assets over the lease terms. We often receive incentives from our landlords, such as rent abatement periods, which effectively reduce the total lease payments owed for these leases. Vehicle, personal computer and other equipment operating leases have terms between three and five years. \n\nThe components of lease cost for operating leases were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Operating lease cost $ 59 &#160; $ 59 &#160; $ 60 &#160; Short-term lease cost 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 1 &#160; \n\nVariable lease cost (a) \n\n15 &#160; 14 &#160; 14 &#160; Sublease income ( 14 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 ) Total lease cost $ 62 &#160; 62 &#160; 61 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Variable lease cost includes cancelable leases, non-fixed maintenance costs and non-recoverable transaction taxes. \n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flow from operating leases $ 53 &#160; $ 57 &#160; $ 59 &#160; Non-cash right of use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 38 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 37 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START October 31, Financial Statement Line Item 2022 2021 (in millions, except lease term and discount rate) Assets: Operating lease: Right of use asset Other assets $ 150 &#160; $ 178 &#160; Liabilities: Current Operating lease liabilities Other accrued liabilities $ 51 &#160; $ 52 &#160; Long-term Operating lease liabilities Other long-term liabilities $ 101 &#160; $ 130 &#160; Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) Operating leases 7.4 years 7.6 years Weighted average discount rate Operating leases 2.4 &#160; % 1.9 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nFuture minimum rents payable as of October 31, 2022 under non-cancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year reconcile to lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Leases (in millions) 2023 $ 53 &#160; 2024 36 &#160; 2025 20 &#160; 2026 11 &#160; 2027 7 &#160; Thereafter 40 &#160; Total undiscounted future minimum lease payments $ 167 &#160; Less: amount of lease payments representing interest ( 15 ) Present value of future minimum lease payments $ 152 &#160; Less: current liabilities ( 51 ) Long-term lease liabilities $ 101 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of October 31, 2022, we had no additional significant operating or finance leases that had not yet commenced. \n\nAs a lessor, we have contracts for equipment leased to customers primarily in connection with our diagnostics business which include both operating-type lease and sales-type finance lease arrangements. We account for the non-lease component under the revenue recognition ASC 606 guidance and the lease component under the leasing ASC 842 guidance. Equipment lease revenue for operating lease agreements is recognized as visualization kits and reagents are shipped over the life of the lease. The cost of customer leased equipment is recorded within property, plant and equipment, and is netted in the consolidated balance sheet with depreciation over the equipment&#8217;s estimated useful life. For an arrangement that has been classified as a sales-type lease, revenue is recognized when the transfer of control of the underlying leased asset has occurred and the net investment lease recorded which is calculated at the present value of the remaining lease payments due from the lessee. \n\nRevenue allocated to the lease income for both sales-type finance lease and operating lease rental arrangements represents less than one percent of total net revenue in the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nAs of October 31, 2022, the original cost and net book value of operating leased assets were $ 29 million and $ 4 million, respectively.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nThe following table presents goodwill balances and the movements for each of our reportable segments during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab Total &#160; (in millions) Goodwill as of October 31, 2020 $ 1,738 &#160; $ 1,599 &#160; $ 265 &#160; $ 3,602 &#160; Foreign currency translation impact 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; 8 &#160; Goodwill arising from acquisitions and adjustments &#8212; &#160; 365 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 365 &#160; Goodwill as of October 31, 2021 $ 1,743 &#160; $ 1,964 &#160; $ 268 &#160; $ 3,975 &#160; Foreign currency translation impact ( 19 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 42 ) Goodwill arising from acquisitions and adjustments 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 19 &#160; Goodwill as of October 31, 2022 $ 1,743 &#160; $ 1,953 &#160; $ 256 &#160; $ 3,952 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we reorganized our operating segments and moved our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. As a result, we reassigned approximately $ 307 million of goodwill from our Agilent Crosslab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment using the relative fair value allocation approach. In addition, we moved service revenue and cost of sales related to the previous acquisition of BioTek from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. As a result, we reassigned approximately $ 10 million of goodwill from our life sciences and applied markets segment to our Agilent Crosslab business segment using the relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill balances as of October 31, 2020, have been recast to conform to this new presentation. There were no changes to our reporting units due to this reorganization. In addition, we performed a goodwill impairment test, and the results of the analysis indicated that the fair values for all three of our reporting units were in excess of their carrying values by substantial amounts; therefore, no impairment was indicated. \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, our annual impairment test date, we assessed goodwill for triggering events and circumstances, and determined no impairment of goodwill was indicated for our reporting units. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nThe component parts of other intangible assets at October 31, 2021 and 2022 are shown in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Other Intangible Assets &#160; Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value &#160; (in millions) As of October 31, 2021: &#160; &#160; &#160; Purchased technology $ 1,742 &#160; $ 972 &#160; $ 770 &#160; Backlog 8 &#160; 3 &#160; 5 &#160; Trademark/Tradename 196 &#160; 133 &#160; 63 &#160; Customer relationships 357 &#160; 228 &#160; 129 &#160; Third-party technology and licenses 11 &#160; 8 &#160; 3 &#160; Total amortizable intangible assets $ 2,314 &#160; $ 1,344 &#160; $ 970 &#160; In-Process R&#38;D 11 &#160; &#8212; 11 &#160; Total $ 2,325 &#160; $ 1,344 &#160; $ 981 &#160; As of October 31, 2022: &#160; &#160; &#160; Purchased technology $ 1,733 &#160; $ 1,068 &#160; $ 665 &#160; Backlog 8 &#160; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Trademark/Tradename 196 &#160; 148 &#160; 48 &#160; Customer relationships 180 &#160; 105 &#160; 75 &#160; Third-party technology and licenses 32 &#160; 9 &#160; 23 &#160; Total amortizable intangible assets $ 2,149 &#160; $ 1,338 &#160; $ 811 &#160; In-Process R&#38;D 10 &#160; &#8212; 10 &#160; Total $ 2,159 &#160; $ 1,338 &#160; $ 821 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022, we acquired Polymer Standards Service GmbH (PSS), a provider of solutions in the field of polymer characterization for $ 41 million. During fiscal year 2022, we recorded additions to goodwill of $ 19 million and additions to other intangible assets of $ 35 million related to the acquisition of PSS and advanced artificial intelligence technology. During the year other intangible assets decreased $ 3 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. \n\nIn 2021, we acquired privately-owned Resolution Bioscience, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of next-generation sequencing-based (\"NGS\") precision oncology solutions, for $ 561 million cash plus potential future contingent payments of up to $ 145 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. See also Note 12, \"Fair Value Measurements\" for additional information. During fiscal year 2021, we recorded additions to goodwill of $ 365 million and additions to other intangible assets of $ 343 million related to this acquisition. During the year, other intangible assets increased $ 2 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. \n\nIn general, for United States federal tax purposes, goodwill from asset purchases is amortizable; however, any goodwill created as part of a stock acquisition is not deductible. \n\nThere were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal years 2022 and 2021. During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $ 90 million in research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations which was related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no impairments of finite-lived intangible assets recorded. During 2022, we also wrote-off the gross carrying amounts of $ 184 million and the related accumulated amortization of fully amortized intangible assets which were no longer being used. \n\nAmortization expense of intangible assets was $ 192 million in 2022, $ 195 million in 2021, and $ 186 million in 2020. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nFuture amortization expense related to existing finite-lived purchased intangible assets associated with business combinations for the next five fiscal years and thereafter is estimated below: \n\n##TABLE_START Estimated future amortization expense: (in millions) 2023 $ 145 &#160; 2024 $ 126 &#160; 2025 $ 102 &#160; 2026 $ 72 &#160; 2027 $ 71 &#160; Thereafter $ 295 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n11. INVESTMENTS \n\nThe following table summarizes the company's equity investments as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 (net book value): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; (in millions) Short-Term Equity investments - with readily determinable fair value $ &#8212; &#160; 91 &#160; Long-Term &#160; &#160; Equity investments - without readily determinable fair value $ 141 &#160; $ 120 &#160; Equity investments - with readily determinable fair value 23 &#160; 31 &#160; Trading securities 31 &#160; 34 &#160; Total long-term investments $ 195 &#160; $ 185 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value (RDFV) consist of non-marketable equity securities issued by private companies. These investments are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost adjusting for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer). The adjustments are included in net income in the period in which they occur. Equity investments with RDFV consist of marketable equity securities which are publicly traded and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. Other investments with RDFV consist of shares we own in a special fund and are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value included in net income. \n\nTrading securities, which are comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, other investments and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. \n\nOur investments without RDFV and marketable equity securities with RDFV are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. \n\nGains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net for our equity investments with RDFV and equity investments without RDFV are summarized below: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2020 ( in millions) Net gain (loss) recognized during the period on equity securities $ ( 67 ) $ 98 &#160; $ 27 &#160; Less: Net gain on equity securities sold during the period 11 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period $ ( 78 ) $ 92 &#160; $ 27 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nUnrealized gains on our equity securities without RDFV were $ 6 million, $ 17 million and $ 27 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIn 2022, net unrealized losses on our trading securities were $ 7 million. In 2021 and 2020, net unrealized gains on our trading securities were $ 8 million and $ 2 million, respectively. \n\nThere were no impairments of investments in 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. \n\nFair Value Hierarchy \n\nThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: \n\nLevel 1 &#8212; applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\nLevel 2 &#8212; applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets; or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. \n\nLevel 3 &#8212; applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fair Value Measurement at October 31, 2022 Using &#160; October 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) &#160; (in millions) Assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash equivalents (money market funds) $ 492 &#160; $ 492 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Trading securities 31 &#160; 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other investments 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total assets measured at fair value $ 577 &#160; $ 523 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Liabilities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration 66 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 66 &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred compensation liability 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 103 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 67 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2021 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Fair Value Measurement at October 31, 2021 Using &#160; October 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) &#160; (in millions) Assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash equivalents (money market funds) $ 919 &#160; $ 919 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Short-term investments - Equity securities with RDFV 91 &#160; 83 &#160; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Trading securities 34 &#160; 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other investments 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total assets measured at fair value $ 1,084 &#160; $ 1,036 &#160; $ 48 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Liabilities: &#160; &#160; &#160; Short-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration 62 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 62 &#160; Long-term &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred compensation liability 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration 27 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 27 &#160; Total liabilities measured at fair value $ 128 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 89 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOur money market funds and trading securities are generally valued using quoted market prices and therefore are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within level 2, as there is \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nnot an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as level 2 because, although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices, the inputs used in the calculations are observable. \n\nShort-term investments - equity securities with readily determinable fair value (\"RDFV\") are shares in marketable equity securities which are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured based on quotes in active markets. Equity securities with RDFV also includes potential shares received from an equity investment in a company that went public and can vest under certain stock performance circumstances. These have been classified as Level 2 because the fair value was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation method in which quoted market price and other observable inputs are used. \n\nTrading securities, which are comprised of mutual funds, bonds and other similar instruments, other investments and deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in net income. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses from the sale of these instruments are recorded in net income. \n\nOther investments represent shares we own in a special fund that targets underlying investments of approximately 40 percent in debt securities and 60 percent in equity securities. These shares have been classified as level 2 because, although the shares of the fund are not traded on any active stock exchange, each of the individual underlying securities are or can be derived from and hence we have a readily determinable value for the underlying securities, from which we are able to determine the fair market value for the special fund itself. \n\nContingent Consideration. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability relates to milestone payments in connection with the acquisition of advanced artificial intelligence technology in February 2022 and the acquisition of Resolution Bioscience in April 2021. \n\nResolution Bioscience. The fair value of the potential future milestone payments, which is set to certain revenue and technical targets, was based on (i) the probability of achieving the relevant revenue targets and technical milestones and (ii) the timing of achieving such milestones, which are significant unobservable inputs, and has been classified as Level 3. We used the Monte Carlo simulation approach to estimate the fair value of the revenue component. The fair value of the revenue component was zero at October 31, 2022. The probability-weighted expected return method was used to estimate the fair value of the technical target component. Assumptions used in the calculations include probability of success, duration of the earn-out and discount rate. A change in any of these unobservable inputs can significantly change the fair value of the contingent consideration. As of October 31, 2022, the expected maximum earn-out period for the contingent payments does not exceed 2.2 years and potential future payments will not exceed $ 145 million. \n\nThe contingent consideration liability is our only Level 3 asset or liability. A summary of the Level 3 activity follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Contingent Consideration (in millions) Balance at October 31, 2020 $ &#8212; &#160; Additions to contingent consideration (including measurement period adjustment) 110 &#160; Change in fair value (included within selling, general and administrative expenses) ( 21 ) Balance at October 31, 2021 $ 89 &#160; Additions to contingent consideration 3 &#160; Change in fair value (included within selling, general and administrative expenses) ( 25 ) Balance at October 31, 2022 67 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration liability as of October 31, 2022 was estimated to be $ 67 million of which $ 66 million was recorded in other accrued liabilities and $ 1 million was recorded in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The net decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration was primarily driven by a change in the probability of achieving the relevant revenue targets. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis \n\nLong-Lived Assets \n\nFor assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, the following table summarizes the impairments included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Long-lived assets held and used $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 98 &#160; Long-lived assets held for sale $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, there were no impairments of long-lived assets held and used. For the year ended October 31, 2021, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $ 2 million were written down to their fair value of zero , resulting in an impairment of $ 2 million. For the year ended October 31, 2020, long-lived assets held and used, including indefinite lived in-process research and development intangible assets, with a carrying amount of $ 98 million were written down to their fair value of zero , resulting in an impairment charge of $ 98 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program and other assets in our diagnostics and genomics segment. \n\nThere were no impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nFair values for the impaired long-lived assets during 2020 were measured using level 3 inputs. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets in 2020, we used the income approach based on projected discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets over the remaining useful life. \n\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities \n\nFor the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no impairments in non-marketable securities without readily determinable fair value. \n\nFor the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, unrealized gains of $ 6 million, $ 17 million and $ 27 million respectively, were included in net income as an adjustment to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair value based on an observable market transaction. \n\nAs of October 31, 2022, the cumulative net gain (loss) on our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values was comprised of a $ 35 million gain and no losses, and the carrying amount was $ 141 million. As of October 31, 2021, the cumulative net gain (loss) on our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values was comprised of a $ 29 million gain and no losses, and the carrying amount was $ 120 million. \n\nFair values for the non-marketable securities included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet were measured using Level 3 inputs because they are primarily equity stock issued by private companies without quoted market prices. To estimate the fair value of our non-marketable securities, we use the measurement alternative to record these investments at cost and adjust for impairments and observable price changes (orderly transactions for the identical or a similar security from the same issuer) as and when they occur. \n\n13. DERIVATIVES \n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts and purchased options to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities between one and \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\ntwelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. For open contracts as of October 31, 2022, changes in the time value of the foreign exchange contract are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in cost of sales over the life of the foreign exchange contract. The changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations when the forecasted transaction occurs. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to other income (expense), net in the current period. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period. We record the premium paid (time value) of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in cost of sales over the life of the option contract. For the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, ineffectiveness and gains and losses recognized in other income (expense), net due to de-designation of cash flow hedge contracts were not significant. \n\nIn February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $ 300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. These derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $ 10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the interest rate swap agreements at October 31, 2022 was $ 4 million. \n\nIn August 2019, Agilent executed treasury lock agreements for $ 250 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2029 senior notes issued on September 16, 2019. We designated the treasury lock as a cash flow hedge. The treasury lock contracts were terminated on September 6, 2019 and we recognized a deferred loss of $ 6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2029 senior notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the treasury lock agreements at October 31, 2022 was $ 4 million. \n\nNet Investment Hedges \n\nWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and are designated and qualify as net investment hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. Changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)- translation adjustment and are assessed for effectiveness against the underlying exposure every reporting period. If the company&#8217;s net investment changes during the year, the hedge relationship will be assessed and de-designated if the hedge notional amount is outside of prescribed tolerance with a gain/loss reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) in the current period. For the year ended October 31, 2022, ineffectiveness and the resultant effect of any gains or losses recognized in other income (expense) due to de-designation of the hedge contracts were not significant. \n\nOther Hedges \n\nAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations, in the current period, along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities. \n\nOur use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors.

RETIREMENT PLANS AND POST RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS \n\nGeneral. Substantially all of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees. \n\nAgilent provides defined benefits to U.S. employees who meet eligibility criteria under the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the \"RP\"). \n\nEffective November 1, 2014, Agilent&#8217;s U.S. RP was closed to new entrants including new employees, new transfers to the U.S. payroll and rehires. As of April 30, 2016, benefits under the RP were frozen. Any pension benefit earned in the U.S. Plans through April 30, 2016, remained fully vested and is payable on termination, retirement, death, or permanent disability, based on an eligible participant&#8217;s years of credited service, age and other criteria. There are no additional benefit accruals after April 30, 2016. \n\nFor eligible service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the Agilent Retirement Plan is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employee under the Agilent defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the \"DPSP\"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. \n\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $ 93 million and $ 136 million, respectively. Note that the projected benefit obligation for the DPSP equals the fair value of plan assets. \n\nAgilent also maintains a Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (\"SBRP\") in the U.S., which is a supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the \"U.S. Plans\" in the tables below. \n\nEligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans based upon factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. \n\nPost-Retirement Medical Benefit Plans. In addition to receiving retirement benefits, Agilent U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees. As of January 1, 2020, the Health Plan for Retirees is comprised solely of insured pre-65 HMOs as the self-funded Pre-Medicare Medical Plan was eliminated effective December 31, 2019. The Health Plan for Retirees was closed to new retiree entrants after December 31, 2020. \n\nIf eligible, a retiree may receive a fixed amount (different fixed amounts for different groups) under the Retiree Medical Account (&#8220;RMA&#8221;) or a fixed monthly amount under the Agilent Reimbursement Arrangement (&#8220;ARA&#8221;). \n\nAny new employee hired on or after November 1, 2014, will not be eligible to participate in the post-retirement medical benefit plans upon retiring. \n\n401(k) Defined Contribution Plan . Eligible Agilent U.S. employees may participate in the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan. We match contributions to employees up to a maximum of 6 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation. Effective May 1, 2016 until April 30, 2022, we provided an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the RP benefits being frozen. The maximum employee contribution to the 401(k) Plan is 50 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation, subject to regulatory limitations. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $ 46 million in 2022, $ 43 million in 2021 and $ 41 million in 2020. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nComponents of Net periodic cost. &#160; The service cost component is recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. All other cost components are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. \n\nFor the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pensions U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans &#160; U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Net periodic benefit cost (benefit) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Service cost &#8212; benefits earned during the period $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Interest cost on benefit obligation 14 &#160; 14 &#160; 15 &#160; 9 &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 3 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 27 ) ( 29 ) ( 28 ) ( 43 ) ( 49 ) ( 47 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Amortization of net actuarial (gain) loss &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; 3 &#160; 25 &#160; 53 &#160; 49 &#160; ( 2 ) 4 &#160; 4 &#160; Amortization of prior service benefit &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 7 ) Total periodic benefit cost (benefit) $ ( 13 ) $ ( 11 ) $ ( 10 ) $ 13 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ ( 6 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 6 ) Settlement loss $ 4 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net actuarial (gain) loss $ 16 &#160; $ ( 92 ) $ 26 &#160; $ ( 83 ) $ ( 114 ) $ 20 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ ( 30 ) $ 5 &#160; Amortization of net actuarial (gain) loss &#8212; &#160; ( 4 ) ( 3 ) ( 25 ) ( 53 ) ( 49 ) 2 &#160; ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of prior service benefit &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 7 &#160; Loss due to settlement ( 4 ) ( 1 ) ( 4 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11 &#160; 5 &#160; 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss $ 12 &#160; $ ( 97 ) $ 19 &#160; $ ( 97 ) $ ( 162 ) $ ( 19 ) $ 18 &#160; $ ( 33 ) $ 8 &#160; Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss $ 3 &#160; $ ( 107 ) $ 13 &#160; $ ( 84 ) $ ( 128 ) $ 15 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ ( 33 ) $ 2 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nFunded Status.

The actuarial net loss that arose in 2021 was primarily due to changes in financial and demographic assumptions and losses due to plan experience offset by increases in discount rates. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nInvestment Policies and Strategies as of October 31, 2022 . In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans were approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumption of a reasonable level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 15 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 30 percent to 80 percent to fixed income investments, from zero to 25 percent to real estate and from zero to 55 percent to annuity contracts, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity and bond markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2022, may differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation. \n\nEquity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trusts and other similar real estate investments. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds that are valued using Net Asset Value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) as the practical expedient. In addition, some of the investments valued using NAV as the practical expedient may have limits on their redemption to weekly or monthly and/or may require prior written notice specified by each fund. In December 2021, we entered into an insurance buy-in contract for a portion of benefit obligations under the U.K. defined benefit plan which was funded from existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations. It has been classified as an &#8220;Annuity Contract&#8221; since the insurance buy-in contract is similar to an annuity contract. It matches cash flows with future benefit payments for listed pensioners as of the contract date with the obligation remaining with the plan. This contract is issued by a third-party insurance company with no affiliation to us. \n\nFair Value. The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 12, \"Fair Value Measurements\". \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds. The funds also invest in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds. Other cash and cash equivalents are generally classified as Level 2 investments. \n\nEquity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock that are not traded on an active market are valued at quoted prices reported by investment dealers based on the underlying terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments. \n\nFixed Income - Some of the fixed income securities are not actively traded and are valued at quoted prices based on the terms of the security and comparison to similar securities traded on an active market; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Securities which have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments. \n\nReal Estate - Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trust and other similar real estate investments. Since the existing securities have quoted prices in active markets, it has been classified as level 1 and grouped with equity. \n\nAnnuity Contract &#8211; This consists of the U.K. insurance buy-in contract. Since it is valued on an insurer pricing basis, which reflects the purchase price adjusted for changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions which approximates fair value, it has been classified as level 3. \n\nOther Investments - Other investments also include partnership investments where, due to their private nature, pricing inputs are not readily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on proprietary appraisals, application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, utilization of market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies and other methods. Holdings of limited partnerships are classified as Level 3. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nAgilent has adopted the accounting guidance related to the presentation of certain investments using the NAV practical expedient. The accounting guidance exempts investments using this practical expedient from categorization within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe following tables present the fair value of U.S. Defined Benefit Plans assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of October 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

During fiscal year 2023, we expect to make no contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the Post-Retirement Medical Plans. We expect to contribute $ 16 million to plans outside the U.S. The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years: \n\n##TABLE_START U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans &#160; (in millions) 2023 $ 31 &#160; $ 32 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2024 $ 34 &#160; $ 33 &#160; $ 6 &#160; 2025 $ 32 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 7 &#160; 2026 $ 32 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 7 &#160; 2027 $ 32 &#160; $ 35 &#160; $ 7 &#160; 2028 - 2032 $ 142 &#160; $ 187 &#160; $ 34 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAssumptions. The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic cost (benefit) for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans - October 31. The U.S. discount rates at October 31, 2022 and 2021, were \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\ndetermined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. rates were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. The range of assumptions that were used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries. \n\nAssumptions used to calculate the net periodic cost (benefit) in each year were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For years ended October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 U.S. defined benefit plans: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 2.75 % 2.75 % 3.25 % Expected long-term return on assets 5.00 % 7.00 % 7.00 % Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 0.29 - 1.76 % \n\n0.07 - 1.54 % \n\n0.22 - 1.81 % \n\nAverage increase in compensation levels 2.00 - 3.50 % \n\n2.00 - 3.00 % \n\n2.25 - 3.00 % \n\nExpected long-term return on assets 2.75 - 5.50 % \n\n4.00 - 5.50 % \n\n4.00 - 5.75 % \n\nInterest crediting rate for cash balance plans 0.30 - 0.50 % \n\n0.10 - 0.50 % \n\n0.00 - 0.75 % \n\nU.S. post-retirement benefits plans: &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rate 2.75 % 2.50 % 3.00 % Expected long-term return on assets 5.00 % 7.00 % 7.00 % Current medical cost trend rate 6.00 % 6.25 % 6.25 % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2027 2029 2029 ##TABLE_END\n\nAssumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; As of the Years Ending October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 U.S. defined benefit plans: &#160; &#160; Discount rate 6.00 % 2.75 % Non-U.S. defined benefit plans: &#160; &#160; Discount rate 1.50 - 4.77 % \n\n0.29 - 1.76 % \n\nAverage increase in compensation levels 2.00 - 3.25 % \n\n2.00 - 3.50 % \n\nInterest crediting rate for cash balance plans 0.50 - 2.10 % \n\n0.30 - 0.50 % \n\nU.S. post-retirement benefits plans: &#160; &#160; Discount rate 6.00 % 2.75 % Current medical cost trend rate 7.00 % 6.00 % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 4.75 % 4.50 % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2029 2027 ##TABLE_END\n\n15. GUARANTEES \n\nStandard Warranty \n\nWe accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in actual warranty charges over the past 12 months. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost over the period. The standard warranty accrual balances are held in other accrued and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our standard warranty terms typically extend to one year from the date of delivery, depending on the product. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nA summary of the standard warranty accrual activity is shown in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; (in millions) Standard warranty accrual, beginning balance $ 30 &#160; $ 32 &#160; Accruals for warranties including change in estimates 50 &#160; 52 &#160; Settlements made during the period ( 50 ) ( 54 ) Standard warranty accrual, ending balance $ 30 &#160; $ 30 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Accruals for warranties due within one year $ 30 &#160; $ 29 &#160; Accruals for warranties due after one year &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Standard warranty accrual, ending balance $ 30 &#160; $ 30 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nBank Guarantees \n\nGuarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and were approximately $ 37 million and $ 46 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A standby letter of credit is a guarantee of payment issued by a bank on behalf of us that is used as payment of last resort should we fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third party. A bank guarantee is a promise from a bank or other lending institution that if we default on a loan, the bank will cover the loss. \n\nIndemnifications in Connection with Transactions \n\nIn connection with various divestitures, acquisitions, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties, their affiliates and/or other related parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnifications may cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax, environmental, intellectual property, litigation and other liabilities related to the business conducted prior to the date of the transaction. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2022. \n\nIndemnifications to Officers and Directors \n\nOur corporate bylaws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Agilent and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the bylaws and the indemnification agreements. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our bylaws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made payments related to these obligations, and the fair value for these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2022. \n\nOther Indemnifications \n\nAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nundiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability was not material as of October 31, 2022. \n\nIn connection with the sale of several of our businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of such businesses, their respective affiliates and other related parties against certain damages that they might incur in the future. The continuing indemnifications primarily cover damages relating to liabilities of the businesses that Agilent retained and did not transfer to the buyers, as well as other specified items. In our opinion, the fair value of these indemnification obligations was not material as of October 31, 2022. \n\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nOther Purchase Commitments. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under \"other purchase commitments\" were approximately $ 139 million. \n\nContingencies: We are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, commercial, real estate, environmental and employment matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we currently believe are reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n17. SHORT-TERM DEBT \n\nCredit Facilities \n\nOn March 13, 2019 , we entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which, as amended, provides for a $ 1 billion five -year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024 , and incremental term loan facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $ 500 million. On April 21, 2021, we entered into an incremental assumption agreement, pursuant to which the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility was increased to $ 1.35 billion and the aggregate amount available for incremental facilities was refreshed to remain at $ 500 million. \n\nAs of both October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we had no borrowings outstanding under the incremental facilities. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the year ended October 31, 2022. \n\nCommercial Paper \n\nUnder our U.S. commercial paper program, we may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $ 1.35 billion with up to 397-day maturities. At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2022 , we had borrowings of $ 35 million outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.54 percent. As of October 31, 2021, w e had no borrowings outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program . \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\n18. LONG-TERM DEBT \n\nTerm Loan Facility \n\nOn April 15, 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement with a group of financial institutions, which provided for a $ 600 million delayed draw term loan that will mature on April 15, 2025. As of October 31, 2022, we had $ 600 million borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.98 percent. Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest, at our option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans or (ii) adjusted term SOFR, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans. The term loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with the covenants for the term loan during the year ended October 31, 2022. \n\nSenior Notes \n\nThe following table summarizes the company's long-term senior notes: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; October 31, 2022 October 31, 2021 &#160; Amortized Principal Amortized Principal &#160; (in millions) 2023 Senior Notes $ &#8212; &#160; $ 599 &#160; 2026 Senior Notes 299 &#160; 298 &#160; 2029 Senior Notes 495 &#160; 494 &#160; 2030 Senior Notes 496 &#160; 496 &#160; 2031 Senior Notes 843 &#160; 842 &#160; Total Senior Notes $ 2,133 &#160; $ 2,729 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n2023 Senior Notes \n\nOn June 21, 2013 , the company issued aggregate principal amount of $ 600 million in senior notes (\"2023 senior notes\"). The 2023 senior notes were issued at 99.544 % of their principal amount. The notes would have matured on July 15, 2023 with a fixed interest rate of 3.875 % per annum. We paid interest semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year and payments commenced January 15, 2014 . \n\nOn May 4, 2022, we used the proceeds from the term loan facility and repaid the $ 600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $ 609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. In May 2022, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 9 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, $ 7 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. \n\n2026 Senior Notes \n\nOn September 22, 2016 , the company issued aggregate principal amount of $ 300 million in senior notes (\"2026 senior notes\"). The 2026 senior notes were issued at 99.624 % of their principal amount. The notes will mature on September 22, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.05 % per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on March 22nd and September 22nd of each year and payments commenced March 22, 2017 . \n\nIn February 2016, Agilent executed three forward-starting pay fixed/receive variable interest rate swaps for the notional amount of $ 300 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2026 senior notes issued on September 15, 2016. The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $ 10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.

SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nDescription of Segments. We are a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers. Our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business moved from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. We also moved BioTek's service revenue and related cost of sales from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. The historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation. There was no change to our diagnostics and genomics business segment. \n\nFollowing this reorganization, we continue to have three business segments comprised of life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab, each of which continues to comprise a reportable segment. The three operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments. \n\nA description of our three reportable segments is as follows: \n\nOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (\"LC\") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (\"LCMS\") systems; gas chromatography (\"GC\") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (\"GCMS\") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") instruments; atomic absorption (\"AA\") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (\"MP-AES\") instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (\"ICP-OES\") instruments; raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer; cell imaging systems; microplate reader; laboratory software for sample tracking; information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies. Our consumables portfolio is designed to improve customer outcomes. Most of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning Agilent can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices. Solutions range from chemistries to supplies. Key product categories in consumables include GC and LC columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and a large selection of laboratory instrument supplies. \n\nOur diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients (\"APIs\") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as next generation sequencing (\"NGS\") target enrichment and genetic data management and interpretation support software. This business also includes solutions that enable clinical labs to identify DNA variants associated with genetic disease and help direct cancer therapy. Second, our nucleic acid solutions business is a contract and development manufacturing organization that provides services related to and the production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical good manufacturing practices (\"GMP\") conditions for use as API in a class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy. Third, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings for cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (\"IHC\"), in situ hybridization (\"ISH\"), hematoxylin and eosin (\"H&#38;E\") staining and special staining. Fourth, we also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential tissue and liquid-based pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Fifth, the reagent partnership business provides clinical flow cytometry reagents for routine cancer diagnostics. This business also provides bulk antibodies as raw materials and \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nassociated assay development services to IVD manufacturers, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Finally, our biomolecular analysis business provides complete workflow solutions, including instruments, consumables and software, for quality control analysis of nucleic acid samples. Samples are analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure accuracy in further genomics analysis techniques including NGS, utilized in clinical and life science research applications. \n\nThe Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes. The majority of the portfolio is vendor neutral, meaning we can serve and supply customers regardless of their instrument purchase choices. The services portfolio include repairs, parts, maintenance, installations, training, compliance support, software as a service, asset management, consulting and various other custom services to support the customers' laboratory operations. Custom services are tailored to meet the specific application needs of various industries and to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. \n\nA significant portion of the segments' expenses arises from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, tax, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury, order administration, other corporate infrastructure expenses, costs of centralized research and development and joint sales and marketing. Charges are allocated to the segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. In addition, we do not allocate asset impairments, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, change in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, transformational initiatives expenses, acceleration of share-based compensation expense related to workforce reduction, business exit and divestiture costs, special compliance costs and certain other charges to the operating margin for each segment because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, in-sourcing or outsourcing of activities. \n\nThe following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including segment income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments. \n\nThe profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding items such as asset impairment charges, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, non-cash amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations, interest income, interest expense, and other items as noted in the reconciliations below. \n\n##TABLE_START Life Sciences and Applied Markets Diagnostics and Genomics Agilent CrossLab Total Segments &#160; (in millions) Year Ended October 31, 2022: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total net revenue $ 4,007 &#160; $ 1,389 &#160; $ 1,452 &#160; $ 6,848 &#160; Income from operations $ 1,186 &#160; $ 301 &#160; $ 370 &#160; $ 1,857 &#160; Depreciation expense $ 59 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 120 &#160; Share-based compensation expense (1) \n\n$ 69 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 120 &#160; Year Ended October 31, 2021: &#160; &#160; &#160; Total net revenue $ 3,663 &#160; $ 1,296 &#160; $ 1,360 &#160; $ 6,319 &#160; Income from operations $ 1,017 &#160; $ 273 &#160; $ 323 &#160; $ 1,613 &#160; Depreciation expense $ 60 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 122 &#160; Share-based compensation expense (1) \n\n$ 60 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 106 &#160; Year Ended October 31, 2020: &#160; &#160; &#160; Total net revenue $ 3,115 &#160; $ 1,047 &#160; $ 1,177 &#160; $ 5,339 &#160; Income from operations $ 792 &#160; $ 192 &#160; $ 272 &#160; $ 1,256 &#160; Depreciation expense $ 58 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 119 &#160; Share-based compensation expense (1) \n\n$ 46 &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 81 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Share-based compensation expense in 2022, 2021 and 2020 excludes amounts not allocated to the segments related to accelerated share-based compensation expense from workforce reduction and from our acquisition of BioTek and Resolution Bioscience. \n\nAGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \n\nThe following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to Agilent's total enterprise income before taxes: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended October 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (in millions) Total reportable segments' income from operations $ 1,857 &#160; $ 1,613 &#160; $ 1,256 &#160; Amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations ( 191 ) ( 194 ) ( 184 ) Acquisition and integration costs ( 25 ) ( 41 ) ( 41 ) Transformational initiatives ( 30 ) ( 37 ) ( 53 ) Acceleration of share-based compensation expense related to workforce reduction &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Asset impairments &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) ( 99 ) Business exit and divestiture costs ( 7 ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 25 &#160; 21 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Special compliance costs &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; \n\nOther (1) \n\n( 11 ) ( 6 ) ( 29 ) Interest Income 9 &#160; 2 &#160; 8 &#160; Interest Expense ( 84 ) ( 81 ) ( 78 ) \n\nOther income (expense), net (2) \n\n( 39 ) 92 &#160; 66 &#160; Income before taxes, as reported $ 1,504 &#160; $ 1,360 &#160; $ 842 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For the year ended October 31, 2020, the other category primarily includes legal costs related to a claim we pursued against Twist Bioscience Corporation in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments. \n\n(2) For the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, other income (expense), net includes net gains and losses on the fair value of equity securities.

The number of shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP is subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding common stock of Agilent or an amount determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the aggregate number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 31 million shares. \n\n(2) We issue securities under our equity compensation plans in forms other than options, warrants or rights. On November 15, 2017 and March 21, 2018, the Board and the stockholders, respectively, approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Plan (the &#8220;2018 Plan&#8221;), which was an amendment and restatement of the company&#8217;s 2009 Stock Plan, approved by the Board and the stockholders, respectively, on November 19, 2008 and March 11, 2009.

The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions to vesting or exercisability, and cash awards.
