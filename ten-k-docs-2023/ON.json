Business \n\nOverview \n\nON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, which operate under the onsemi TM brand (\"onsemi,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or the \"Company\"), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1992. \n\nWe provide industry leading intelligent power and sensing solutions to help our customers solve challenging problems and create cutting edge products for a better future. Our intelligent power technologies enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems. Our intelligent power solutions for automotive allows our customers to exceed range targets with lower weight and reduce system cost through efficiency. Our intelligent sensing technologies support the next generation industry allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible. We believe the evolution of the automotive industry, with advancements in autonomous driving, ADAS, vehicle electrification, and the increase in electronics content for vehicle platforms, is reshaping the boundaries of transportation. \n\nThrough sensing integration, we believe our intelligent power solutions achieve superior efficiencies compared to our peers. This integration allows lower temperature operation and reduced cooling requirements while saving costs and minimizing weight. In addition, our power solutions deliver power with less die per module, achieving higher range for a given battery capacity. \n\nAdditionally, we serve a broad base of end-user markets, which include communications, computing and consumer. \n\nWe are organized into the following three operating and reportable segments: the Power Solutions Group (\"PSG\"), the Advanced Solutions Group (\"ASG\") and the Intelligent Sensing Group (\"ISG\"). \n\nBusiness Strategy Developments \n\nOur primary focus continues to be on profitable revenue growth in our focused end-markets of automotive and industrial infrastructure, as well as obtaining longer-term supply arrangements with strategic end-customers. We are focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating and capital expenditures. We have made significant progress on gross margin and operating margin expansion by focusing our capital allocation on research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products and end-markets. Additionally, we continue to rationalize our product portfolio by moving away from non-differentiated, non-strategic products, which in most cases had lower gross and operating margins. To this effect, in September 2022, we approved an exit plan to wind down QCS, which will further enable us to direct our investments to areas of strategic focus. \n\nDuring 2022, we completed the divestitures of certain manufacturing facilities. We believe these actions, among others, will allow us to transition from sub-scale factories into a lighter internal fabrication model where our financial performance will be less volatile and not as heavily influenced by our internal manufacturing volumes. We will continue to evaluate our manufacturing footprint in 2023 to align with our investment priorities and corporate strategy. Our goal is to reduce volatility in our gross margins and maximize return on our manufacturing investments with the intention of having our product strategy drive our manufacturing footprint and capital investments. In 2023, our focus will be on ramping up manufacturing at our recently acquired East Fishkill, New York fabrication (\"EFK\") facility, as well as investing to expand our facilities in the Czech Republic, Hudson, New Hampshire, and South Korea to increase our SiC manufacturing capabilities to meet the growing demand for our SiC-based solutions. \n\nSee Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to our acquisition and divestiture activity. \n\nRecent Acquisitions \n\nOn December 31, 2022, we completed our acquisition of the EFK facility and certain other assets and liabilities from GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. (\"GFUS\"), which was previously announced in April 2019, for total consideration of \n\n$406.3 million. In connection with the acquisition agreement, we paid GFUS $100.0 million and $70.0 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the balance of $236.3 million paid on January 3, 2023. In addition, in 2019 we paid GFUS a one-time license fee of $30.0 million for certain technology, which has been recognized as an intangible asset subject to amortization. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination. \n\nOn October 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (\"GTAT\"), a producer of SiC substrates. The purchase price for the acquisition was $434.9 million, which included cash consideration of $424.6 million and effective settlement of pre-acquisition balances (non-cash) of approximately $10.0 million, in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests of GTAT. We believe the acquisition of GTAT will act as a building block to fuel growth and secure supply of SiC to meet growing customer demand for SiC-based solutions. \n\nCompleted Divestitures of Certain Manufacturing Facilities \n\nDuring 2022, in line with our business strategy, we divested our wafer manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium, South Portland, Maine, Pocatello, Idaho and Niigata, Japan. We agreed to wafer supply agreements with the respective buyers of these facilities to ensure that there is no disruption in our ability to meet customer demand for our products. \n\nSee Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nNew Legislation \n\nIn August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act, H.R. 4346 (the \"CHIPS Act\") and the Inflation Reduction Act, H.R. 5376 (the \"IR Act\") were signed into law. Among other things, the CHIPS Act provides various incentives and tax credits to United States companies for research, development, manufacturing and workforce development in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The IR Act introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (\"CAMT\") for certain corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases. The Company is evaluating the provisions of the new laws and the potential impacts to the Company. See Note 4: ''Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments''' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nRevenue-Generating Activities \n\nonsemi generates revenue from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors and direct customers. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing. \n\nThe following table illustrates the product technologies under each of our segments based on our operating strategy: \n\n##TABLE_START PSG ASG ISG 2022 Revenue (%) 50.5% 34.1% 15.3% Analog products Analog products Actuator Drivers SiC products ASIC products CMOS Image Sensors Discrete products ECL products Image Signal Processors MOSFET products Foundry products / services LSI products Power Module products Gate Driver products Single Photon Detectors Isolation products LSI products Sensors Memory products Standard Logic products Gate Driver products Standard Logic products ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 3: ''Revenue and Segment Information'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for other information regarding our segments, their revenue and property, plant and equipment and the gross profit derived from each segment. \n\nProducts and Technology \n\nThe following provides certain information regarding the products and technologies for each of our operating segments. \n\nPSG \n\nPSG offers a wide array of analog, discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products that perform multiple application functions, including power switching, power conversion, signal conditioning, circuit protection, signal amplification and voltage regulation functions. The trends driving growth within our end-user markets are primarily higher power efficiency and power density in power applications, the demand for greater functionality, and faster data transmission rates in all communications. The advancement of existing volt electrical infrastructure, electrification of power train in the form of EV/HEV, higher trench density enabling lower losses in power efficient packages and lower capacitance and integrated signal conditioning products to support faster data transmission rates significantly increase the use of high-power semiconductor solutions. The recent increase in the use of WBG MOSFETs and diodes, including SiC and IGBT, is further expanding the use of semiconductor products. \n\nASG \n\nASG designs and develops analog, mixed-signal, advanced logic, ASSPs and ASICs, RF and integrated power solutions for a broad base of end-users in different end-markets. Our product solutions enable industry leading active mode and standby mode efficiency now demanded by regulatory agencies around the world. Additionally, ASG offers trusted foundry and design services for our government customers, which leverages our broad range of manufacturing, IC design, packaging, and silicon technology offerings to provide turn-key solutions for our customers. \n\nISG \n\nISG designs and develops CMOS image sensors, image signal processors, single photon detectors, including SiPM and SPAD arrays, as well as actuator drivers for autofocus and image stabilization for a broad base of end-users in the different end-markets. Our broad range of product offerings delivers excellent pixel performance, sensor functionality and camera systems capabilities in which high quality visual imagery is becoming increasingly important to our customers and their end-users, particularly in automotive and factory automation and in applications powered by AI. \n\nCustomers \n\nWe sell our products to distributors and direct customers for ultimate use in a variety of end-products in different end-markets. In general, we have maintained long-term relationships with our key customers and our sales agreements are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. During 2022, we entered into a number of long-term supply agreements with certain strategic end-customers, which generally include minimum purchase commitments. Certain of our agreements, subject to our standard terms and conditions, have provisions allowing for termination at any time for convenience by either party. \n\nWe generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Our standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery, except in the case of image sensor products, which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with our customers, they may cancel orders 120 days prior to shipment for standard products without penalty and, for custom products, prior to shipment, provided they pay onsemi's actual costs incurred as of the date we receive the cancellation notice. The loss of one of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment, and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. \n\nDistributors \n\nSales to distributors accounted for approximately 58% of our revenue in 2022, 64% of our revenue in 2021 and 60% of our revenue in 2020. We had one distributor whose revenue accounted for approximately 12% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our distributors resell our products to contract manufacturers, OEMs among other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. \n\nDirect Customers \n\nSales to direct customers, accounted for approximately 42% of our revenue in 2022, 36% of our revenue in 2021 and 40% of our revenue in 2020. Large multi-nationals and selected regional OEMs, which are significant in specific markets, form our core direct customers. Generally, these customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty. \n\nFor additional information regarding agreements with our customers, see \"Markets,\" \"Resources\" and \"Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and Note 2: ''Significant Accounting Policies'' under the heading \"Revenue Recognition\" in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nMarkets \n\nProduct Development \n\nonsemi is focused on innovation to create intelligent power and sensing technologies that solve the most challenging customer problems. Our product development efforts are directed towards the following: \n\n&#8226; Powering the electrification of the automotive industry with our intelligent power technologies that allow for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles and enable efficient fast-charging systems; \n\n&#8226; Propelling the sustainable energy evolution with our intelligent power technologies for the highest efficiency solar strings, industrial power and storage systems; \n\n&#8226; Enhancing the automotive mobility experience with our intelligent sensing technologies with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible; and \n\n&#8226; Enabling automation and data exchange (Industry 4.0) with our intelligent sensing technologies for smarter factories and buildings. \n\nWhile our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in areas that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high-growth applications, it is our practice to regularly re-evaluate our research and development spending, to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high-growth technologies. We deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing the return for our research and development investments by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth applications that we believe position us to outperform the industry. \n\nEnd-Markets \n\nWe serve a broad base of end-user markets, with a primary focus towards automotive and industrial. The following table sets forth our principal end-markets, the estimated percentage (based in part on information provided by our distributors) of our revenue generated from each end-market during 2022, and sample applications for our products. Other includes the end-markets of communication, consumer and computing. \n\n##TABLE_START Automotive Industrial Other 2022 Revenue (%) 40.4% 27.5% 32.1% Sample applications EV Energy &#38; EV Charging Infrastructure Cloud Computing/Data Center Servers \n\nADAS Industrial Automation 5G Base Stations \n\nPower Management Security &#38; Surveillance Graphics Cards \n\nPowertrain Machine Vision Gaming, Home Entertainment Systems, &#38; Set Top Boxes \n\nIn-Vehicle Networking Smart Cities &#38; Buildings Routers Body &#38; Interior Hearing Health, Diagnostic, Therapy, &#38; Monitoring Notebooks, Laptops, Desktop PCs and Tablets \n\nLighting Power Solutions USB Type-C \n\nSensors AR/VR White Goods \n\nEngine Control Motor Control Power Supplies \n\nRobotics Smart Phones \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCompetition \n\n&#160; \n\nWe face significant competition from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because some of our components include functionality that in some cases may be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See \"Risk Factors&#8212;Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nSome of our competitors have greater financial and other resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments: \n\nPSG \n\nOur competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading-edge fabrication technologies, micro and module packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high quality cost effective manufacturing and supply chain management, which ensures supply to our customers. Our commitment to continual innovation allows us to provide an ever broader range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency, the key performance characteristics driving our markets. \n\nThe principal methods of competition in our discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products are through new products and package innovations enabling enhanced performance over existing products. Of particular importance are our intelligent power technologies based on silicon and SiC wide band gap technologies, which we use to design, manufacture, and deliver to our customers as bare die, packaged discrete solutions or power module solutions. In addition to our power technologies, we believe our integrated circuit, signal and protection technologies have significant performance advantages over our competition. PSG&#8217;s primary competitors include: Infineon Technologies AG (\"Infineon\"), STMicroelectronics N.V. (\"STMicroelectronics\"), Wolfspeed Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated (\"TI\") and Nexperia BV. \n\nASG \n\n&#160; \n\nASG principally competes on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel. Our competitive position with respect to the above basis is enhanced by long-standing relationships with leading direct customers. \n\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability of supply, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Competitors for certain of ASG's products and solutions include: Infineon, NXP Semiconductors N.V. (\"NXP\"), STMicroelectronics and TI. \n\nISG \n\nISG differentiates itself from the competition through deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive leading edge sensing performance for both human and machine vision applications. ISG has significant imaging experience and was one of the earliest to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors and introduce CMOS technology in many of our markets. ISG has leveraged this expertise into market leading positions in automotive and industrial applications, which allows us to offer technical and end-user applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative sensing solutions across a broad range of end-user needs. \n\nCompetitors for certain of ISG's products and solutions include: Sony Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Omnivision Technologies Inc. \n\nSales, Marketing and Distribution \n\nWe have global distribution centers in China, the Philippines and Singapore. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers' needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers, allowing for applications that are developed in one region of \n\nthe world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions. \n\nBacklog \n\nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are booked as far as 52 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped in the current or future period. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Historically, a significant portion of our backlog was cancellable, however, our current agreements, including orders subject to minimum purchase commitments under our longer-term supply arrangements, are not subject to cancellation, unless otherwise mutually agreed. \n\nResources \n\nRaw Materials \n\nOur manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, SiC wafers, laminate substrates, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes. We seek to obtain our raw materials and supplies in a timely, planned manner from our suppliers to allow for our manufacturing cycle to align with the timing of our customer demands. However, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control, including any caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises. \n\nManufacturing and Design Operations \n\nWe currently have domestic design operations in Arizona, California, Idaho, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah and Virginia. We also have foreign design operations in Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Romania, Singapore, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. In October 2022, we ceased operations at our design locations in Australia and Russia as part of the exit plan to wind down QCS. We operate front-end wafer fabrication facilities in the Czech Republic, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the United States and back-end assembly and test site facilities in Canada, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to these front-end and back-end manufacturing operations, our facility in Hudson, New Hampshire manufactures SiC crystal boules and our facility in Ro&#382;nov pod Radho&#353;t&#283;m, Czech Republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities. \n\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or pursuant to joint ventures, the reportable segments that use such facilities, and the approximate gross square footage of each site's building, which includes, among other things, manufacturing, laboratory, warehousing, office, utility, support and unused areas. \n\n##TABLE_START Location Reportable Segment Size (sq. ft.)

The financial and operating results of Leshan have been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner is Leshan Radio Company Ltd. (\"Leshan Radio\"), is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement between us and Leshan Radio, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment, provided that any shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We purchased 80% of Leshan's production capacity in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan's expected production capacity in 2023. \n\nWe use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These manufacturers collectively accounted for approximately 43% of our total manufacturing input costs in 2022, 37% in 2021 and 33% in 2020. \n\nFor information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see \"Risk Factors &#8212; Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights \n\n&#160; \n\nWe market our products under worldwide trademarks including the ON Semiconductor, ON, onsemi, and various product names and logos, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our IP. We acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous United States and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. As of December 31, 2022, we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2043, and none of the patents that expire in the next three years are expected to materially affect our business. We do not consider our business substantially dependent on any single onsemi patent. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. \n\nFor information regarding risks associated with intellectual property, see \"Risk Factors &#8212; Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nSeasonality \n\nWe believe our business today is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality, as was the case historically. Our 2022 results were positively influenced by macroeconomic factors including a better-than-expected demand and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic along with our efforts focused on price increases, better utilization, product diversification and content gains. We could again experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or macroeconomic conditions. For information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business, see \"Risk Factors&#8212;Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of contamination. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, with respect to such matters, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines. \n\nWe believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable environmental regulations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, together with any liabilities for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or earnings or on our competitive position. It is possible, however, that future developments, including \n\nchanges in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. See Note 13: ''Commitments and Contingencies'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters. \n\nWe are also subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, trade barriers, trade embargoes, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act (\"ITAR\"), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Additionally, United States or China governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could impact our operations. \n\nWe believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable trade regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, ITAR, FCPA, the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, and similar applicable laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable trade regulations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing trade laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or earnings or on our competitive position. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations or government policies, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. For information regarding risks associated with import-export control regulations and similar applicable laws and regulations, see \"Risk Factors&#8212;Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Initiatives \n\nonsemi strives to be a responsible corporate citizen. We uphold ethical standards in our business practices and policies, and we believe that sustainable corporate practices and consistent attention to environmental, social and governance priorities will help enhance long-term value for our stockholders. \n\nIn 2022, onsemi affirmed its climate change policy, highlighting the focus areas for its climate change-related actions. onsemi is committed to protect and respect its environment and energy resources for future generations throughout its operations, including wafer fabrication, assembly, test, support operations, and through its value chain. In that regard, onsemi has committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2040. \n\nWe work together with our customers, peers, partners and suppliers to promote continual improvement in human rights, labor, environment, health and safety, anti-corruption, ethics and management system standards within our operations and our supply chain. We proactively comply with the Responsible Business Alliance (&#8220;RBA&#8221;) Code of Conduct including the elimination of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking and conflict minerals pursuant to our involvement with the Responsible Minerals Initiative. \n\nOur Board of Directors (the \"Board of Directors\") and management regularly evaluate our corporate responsibility policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and other corporate social responsibility policies and programs, to ensure an effective outcome and adherence by our employees, suppliers, vendors and partners. \n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nCore Principles \n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate our employees involved in the design, development, manufacturing and support of new and existing products and services. As we are a member of the RBA, its principles are fundamental to our corporate culture and core values and are reflected in our commitments to our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders. These principles include providing a safe and positive work environment to our employees that emphasizes learning and professional development and respect for individuals and ethical conduct. \n\nHeadcount \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 31,000 regular full-time employees and approximately 109 part-time and temporary employees in facilities located in 34 countries. Approximately 10.8% of our regular full-time employees are located in the United States and Canada, 11.0% in Europe and Middle Eastern countries and 78.1% in Asia Pacific and Japan, with approximately 74.7% engaged in manufacturing, 1.7% in research and development, 3.5% in customer service or other aspects of sales and marketing, and 20.1% in other roles. Approximately 116 of our domestic employees (or approximately 3.6% of our United States-based employees) are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. All of these employees are located at our Mountain Top, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements (e.g., those in China, Vietnam, Japan, the Czech Republic and Belgium) or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils. \n\nThe disclosed headcount information does not include the addition of approximately 1,050 full-time employees who joined the Company as part of the EFK acquisition, which was completed on December 31, 2022, as their employment with onsemi was not effective until January 1, 2023. For additional information, see Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nWe are consciously expanding the diversity of our workforce, creating growth and development opportunities for our employees, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment. We have organization-level and overall metrics to monitor for diverse director-level and above employees, diverse new hires and diverse promotions. Our Human Resources organization and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workflow equity and workplace inclusion. \n\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, Safety and Wellness \n\nOur compensation philosophy is focused on delivering competitive compensation with total rewards based on corporate affordability in a way that enables attraction, retention, and recognition of performance delivered in an equitable manner. We provide our employees and their families with access to flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that secure them during events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being. We use a combination of total rewards and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract and retain our employees, including: annual performance bonuses; stock awards, including an employee stock purchase plan; retirement support; healthcare and insurance benefits; business travel and disability insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; flexible work schedules, vacation and paid time off; parental leave; paid counseling assistance; backup child and adult care; education assistance; and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers. \n\nCareer Growth and Development \n\nWe invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee motivation, performance and improving retention. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have established a leadership pathway model as a tool for employees to practice and apply learning as part of their development. \n\nTurnover \n\nWe monitor employee turnover rates by region and globally. The average tenure of our employees is approximately seven years and approximately one-fifth of our employees have been employed by us for more than 10 years. We believe our compensation philosophy along with the career growth and development opportunities promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover. \n\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant \n\nCertain information concerning our executive officers as of February 6, 2023 is set forth below. \n\n##TABLE_START Name Age Position Hassane El-Khoury 43 President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Thad Trent 55 Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Ross F.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nForward-Looking Statements \n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated in this Form 10-K could be deemed forward-looking statements, particularly statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under the headings \"Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business.\" Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"should\" or similar expressions, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are made based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions, and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements are described below. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update such information, which speak only as of the date made, except as may be required by law. \n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, and you should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. The risk factors described herein are not all of the risks we may face. Other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. \n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business \n\nThe manufacturing and other operations required to produce our products are highly dependent on the efficient operation of numerous processes, including processes contingent upon third party component manufacturers and other service providers, and any disruption in these processes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nOur manufacturing network includes multiple owned and third-party facilities, which may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product. As a result of this interdependence, an operational disruption at a facility may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. In the event of a disruption at any such facility, we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties, in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed. Conversely, some of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our end-products, and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product. In the event of any such operational disruption, we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities or transferring production to other \n\nexisting facilities, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nIn addition, for certain manufacturing activities and for the supply of raw materials, we utilize third-party suppliers. Our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs, which may be inaccurate, and, in some cases, require longer-term commitments. We are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized third-party suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies. Arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time-consuming and costly, and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited. Our business operations, productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated, the cost of such services increased significantly, the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect. Generally, our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations, and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources. Shortages could occur in various essential raw materials, and if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner, the costs of our raw materials increases significantly, their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\nOur manufacturing efficiency is contingent upon the operations of these interdependent processes and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this manufacturing efficiency, increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors, or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans. If we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities, testing facilities and external manufacturers at expected or minimum purchase obligation levels, or if production capacity increases while revenue does not, the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities and arrangements will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe may be unable to implement certain business strategies and any issue with the pursuit of such business strategies could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nWe may from time to time determine to implement business strategies and restructuring initiatives in order to remain competitive. Because our strategies and restructuring activities may involve changes to many aspects of our business, including the location of our production facilities and personnel and the potential exit of certain product lines and businesses, our ability to successfully do so depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we are not able to effectively manage or efficiently implement these strategies and/or restructuring initiatives for reasons within or outside of our control, then our business operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, implementation of a business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations. For example, following the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040, we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating net-zero emissions that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations. Similarly, the contingent risks associated with transferring our existing operations to an acquirer, as is the case with several transition services being provided in connection with our recent divestitures, could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations. Furthermore, our increased investment in manufacturing capacity (including the recent acquisition of EFK and increased investment in capacity for SiC-based products and technology), while concurrently winding down our QCS business and divesting other non-strategic operations, may adversely impact our existing operations, require additional management time and effort to implement successfully, and lead to higher than anticipated capital expenditures. \n\nAs we continue to increase production of SiC-based products and ramp manufacturing at EFK and at our facilities in Hudson, New Hampshire, the Czech Republic and South Korea, we may face challenges or risks related to: increased capital spending and long-term capital expenditure commitments, installing and qualifying new manufacturing equipment, meeting planned process yields, maintaining suitable quality control and educating or providing employees with the requisite know-how to operate the processes at our expanded manufacturing facilities. There are inherent execution risks in expanding production capacity, whether at one of our own factories or at a third party that we utilize, all of which could increase our costs and negatively impact our operating results. \n\nThe failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, even if we fully execute and implement these activities, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. To the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other anticipated benefits of strategy or restructuring initiatives, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\nIf we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments or develop new products required to satisfy customer demands, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market enhanced technologies and products. The development of new products is complex and time-consuming, often requiring significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive. In addition, the lengthy development cycle for certain of our products could limit our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and end-users, and we may be unable to develop innovative responses to our customers&#8217; and end-users&#8217; evolving needs on the timelines they require or at all. There can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes, known as \"design wins,\" for new products. In addition, design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments, realize a return on the capital expended or achieve expected gross margins, as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. To the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts, fail to recognize the need for innovation with respect to our products, or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products, we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products attractive to customers, and so our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, products that are commercially viable may not have an immediate impact on our revenue or contribute to our operating results in a meaningful way until at least a few years after they are introduced into the market. \n\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, innovation, short product life cycles, evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions. Products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and, as demand for older technology falls, the price at which such products can be sold drops. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products. In certain limited cases, we may not be able to cease production of older products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and, as a result, may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time. If reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for products we sell, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and has experienced significant consolidation, and if we are unable to compete effectively or identify attractive opportunities for consolidation, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nOur ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry depends on elements both within and outside of our control. We face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. \n\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our competitive position could be weakened relative to our peers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Products or technologies developed by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price, quality, technical performance, features, system compatibility, customized design, innovation, availability, delivery timing and reliability. If we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support, our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected. Competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices, and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin. Our gross margins vary due to a variety of factors. Reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nThe semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. Larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business. Consolidation among competitors and integration among customers could erode our market share, impair our capacity to compete and require us to restructure operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nIn addition, although the CHIPS Act provides various incentives and tax credits to United States companies for domestic \n\nsemiconductor manufacturing, we may be unsuccessful (including, relative to the efforts of our competitors) in any efforts to obtain such incentives and tax credits. \n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the COVID-19 pandemic and related adverse public health developments have been causing, and may continue to cause, disruption to our domestic and international operations and sales activities. In addition, there may be associated worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on certain of our employees&#8217; ability to perform their jobs, office and factory closures or restrictions, labor shortages, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing activities or those of our suppliers, third-party distributors or sub-contractors, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any economic downturn or recession brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises could adversely affect demand for our products and impact our results of operations and financial condition. These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, legal exposure, or financial condition. \n\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive and industrial end-markets, a downturn or lower sales to customers in either end-market could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry and the industrial sector. Sales into the automotive and industrial end-markets represented approximately 40.4% and 27.5% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The automotive industry is cyclical and the industrial sector tends to thrive during a time of economic expansion, and, as a result, our customers in each end-market are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, inflationary pressure, disruptive innovation and end-market preferences, which can adversely affect sales of our products and, correspondingly, our results of operations. Additionally, the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in each end-market could decline despite continued growth in such end-markets. Lower sales to customers in either end-market may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, to the extent we have long-term supply agreements with our customers which includes fixed pricing, we could be subject to fluctuating manufacturing costs that could negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, under our long-term supply agreements, we could incur certain obligations if we are not able to fulfill our commitments. \n\nOur operating results depend, in part, on the performance of independent distributors. \n\nA portion of our sales occurs through global and regional distributors that are not under our control. We rely on distributors to grow and develop their customer base and anticipate customer needs, and any lack of such actions by our distributors may adversely affect our results of operations. These independent distributors also generally represent product lines offered by several companies and are not subject to any minimum sales requirements or obligation to market our products to their customers. In turn, distributors could reduce their sales efforts for our products or choose to terminate their representation of us. Additionally, we rely on our distributors to provide accurate and timely sales reports in order for us to be able to generate financial reports that accurately represent distributor sales of our products during any given period. Any inaccuracies or untimely reports could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports and recognize revenue. \n\nChanges in, and the regulatory implementation of, tariffs or other government trade policies or political conditions could reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nThe imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies or political conditions may adversely affect our sales and profitability. For example, additional tariffs and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the United States and China and other countries may cause decreased end-market demand for our products from distributors and other customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. More specifically, our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests, may be subjected to increased costs or additional trade restrictions stemming from the geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China. Additional tariffs or trade restrictions between the two countries could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nIn addition, tariffs on components that we import from certain nations that have imposed, or may in the future impose, tariffs \n\nmay adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. To the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\nOur international sales and purchases are subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations related to import and export matters. For example, licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries under applicable export control regulations, including the provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. A determination by the United States government or any foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations can result in penalties, including fines, administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, seizure of products, or, in the extreme case, denial of export privileges or suspension or debarment from government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and results of operations. \n\nWe may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. \n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel, both in the United States. and internationally. In the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense. Furthermore, we have operations in many parts of the world that are currently experiencing a tight labor market for skilled employees. Additionally, we have entered into employment agreements with certain senior executives, but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees. Many of these employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor. Specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of our business. Loss of the services of, or failure to effectively recruit, qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business. \n\nWarranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls, and the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts, could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nManufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities in our manufacturing materials, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, manufacturing equipment failures, and other defects can cause our products to be non-compliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. As suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design, OEMs are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, if any, and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Even if our products meet standard specifications, our customers may attempt to use our products in applications for which our products were not designed or in customer products that were not designed or manufactured properly, resulting in product failures and creating customer satisfaction issues, which may harm our reputation. \n\nSince a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved. In certain instances, we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions or other contractual provisions, but there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective. To the extent we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits received from the products involved, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nCurrency fluctuations, changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe have sizeable sales and operations in the Asia/Pacific region and Europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than U.S. dollars. In addition, while a significant percentage of our cash is generated outside the \n\nUnited States, many of our liabilities, including our outstanding indebtedness, and certain other cash payments, such as share repurchases, are payable in the United States in U.S. dollars. As a result, currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. \n\nIn addition, repatriation of funds held outside the U.S. could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations. Foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency. As a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the United States, our financial flexibility may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations. Restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the United States may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. \n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property \n\nIf our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the IP rights of others, efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing the IP rights of others. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such IP rights. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for IP we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies. Further, we may be subject to IP litigation, which could cause us to incur significant expense, materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome or pursuant to the terms of a settlement of any such litigation, we may be required to: pay substantial damages or settlement costs; indemnify customers or distributors; cease the manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies; discontinue the use of certain processes; or obtain licenses, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to continue the use, development and/or sale of the allegedly infringing technologies. \n\nThe outcome of IP litigation is inherently uncertain and, if not resolved in our favor, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIf we are unable to protect the IP we have developed or licensed, our competitive position, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nThe enforceability of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, software licenses and other IP is uncertain in certain circumstances. Effective IP protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in the United States and internationally. The various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered IP assets, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts. With respect to our IP generally, we cannot assure you that: \n\n&#8226; any of the substantial number of United States or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others; \n\n&#8226; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; \n\n&#8226; any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others; \n\n&#8226; any of our pending or future trademark, copyright, or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; or \n\n&#8226; that we will be able to successfully enforce our IP rights in the United States or foreign countries. \n\nWhen we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the IP right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged IP rights of its own against us, which may materially and adversely impact our business. An unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, which could in turn negatively affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nIn addition, some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors&#8217; rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to IP arising out of our research. Should we be unable to protect our IP, competitors \n\nmay develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies, benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Technology and Data Privacy \n\nWe may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our information technology systems that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe routinely collect and store sensitive data, including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our information technology caused by computer viruses, illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error. Our cyber security measures and/or those of our third-party service providers and/or customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. The costs to us to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Any such compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets, the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws. In addition, computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, and any such attack, if successful, could expose us to liability to customer claims. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. \n\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect Personally Identifiable Information (\"PII\") and other data as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the United States. Additionally, within the United States, different states have enacted various regulations governing the treatment of PII. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to Company officials or us, including substantial monetary fines, and could damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business. \n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Regulation \n\nEnvironmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental regulations that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. We also have operations subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other requirements, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. We have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites, and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances. However, we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including: \n\n&#8226; changes in United States and international environmental or health and safety laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns; \n\n&#8226; the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted; \n\n&#8226; our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities; \n\n&#8226; the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions; or \n\n&#8226; the cost of fines, penalties or other legal liability, should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations. \n\nTo the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance, we may bear the full effect of such costs, expenses and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe could be subject to changes in tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex income tax and transfer pricing regulations. Changes to, or interpretations of, tax legislation or regulations could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities. In addition, other factors or events, such as changes to our operating structure, strategy and investment decisions, could also increase our future effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities. \n\nTax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. We implemented certain restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2020. After our restructuring, most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income (&#8220;FDII&#8221;). Beginning in 2026, the effective rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced. \n\nFurther changes in tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nIn August 2022, the U.S. enacted the CHIPS Act and the IR Act. It will take time for additional clarifying guidance and regulations to be issued, and this guidance will be required for a more complete interpretation of this new legislation. The impact of this new legislation may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made and future regulatory guidance. \n\nThis new legislation could have a material benefit or material adverse impact, and may have a material impact on our financial condition. We are in the process of analyzing the potential aggregate current and future impacts of this legislation relative to how we do business, our cash flows and our results of operations. \n\nSocial and environmental responsibility regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors. \n\nWith the increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, a number of our \n\ncustomers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. In addition, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers&#8217; demands, which may harm our sales and operating results. \n\nMany investors also expect companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics under voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks. We have communicated our strategies, commitments and targets related to our corporate social and environmental policies and programs . These strategies, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, but we may be unable to achieve them. It is also possible that our investors might not be satisfied with our policies, programs, commitments, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs and commitments at all. \n\nIn addition, unfavorable ratings or assessment of our corporate social and environmental policies and programs , including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital. \n\nFurthermore, following the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040, we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating net-zero emissions that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations. \n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Indebtedness \n\nOur debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $3,228.3 million of outstanding principal relating to our indebtedness. We may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt, to make acquisitions or for other purposes, and if we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $1.5 billion available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors, including impacting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. \n\nTo the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe inability to meet our obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement could materially and adversely affect us by, among other things, limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. \n\nThe obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of our domestic subsidiaries. As a result, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness, in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, subject to customary exceptions, the Amended Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan \"B\" Facility rather than using funds for other business purposes. Our financing structure, and any inability to meet our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including, among other things, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. \n\nThe agreements relating to our indebtedness, including the Amended Credit Agreement and the 3.875% Notes, may restrict our ability to operate our business, and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur debt agreements, including the Amended Credit Agreement and the 3.875% Notes, contain, and any future debt agreements may include, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens; make certain investments or acquisitions; settle a conversion of our 1.625% Notes in whole or in part with cash; redeem, or otherwise perform our obligations under the terms of, our 3.875% Notes; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; engage in mergers or \n\nconsolidations or certain other \"change of control\" transactions; make distributions to our stockholders; engage in restructuring activities; engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; and issue or repurchase stock or other securities. \n\nSuch agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. \n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, and any inability to repay our debt when required would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make required payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive, and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling additional assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. \n\nFurthermore, we cannot assure you that, if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event, our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. A default under our committed credit facilities, including our Amended Credit Agreement, could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock, which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders. \n\nAn event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIf there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness. Any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIf our operating subsidiaries, which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt, are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nWe conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal, contractual, governmental, or regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIf interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time, including under our Amended Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on \n\nthe variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. While we have entered into swap agreements to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our Term Loan \"B\" Facility through 2024, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. To the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated, the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nOur Amended Credit Agreement and our interest rate swap agreements currently have an interest rate tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;), but were previously tied to the LIBO Rate. The phase-out of the LIBO Rate is underway and will conclude by July 1, 2023 when LIBO Rates and quotations are scheduled to be discontinued. In response to the phasing out of the LIBO Rate, on March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;), pursuant to which certain contracts that rely on the LIBO Rate and do not contain procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that the LIBO Rate is discontinued will transition from the LIBO Rate to SOFR, effective July 1, 2023. While the LIBOR Act effectively established SOFR as the default replacement rate for the LIBO Rate, there can be no assurances that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark, or that SOFR or other alternative base rates will be more or less favorable than the LIBO Rate. The discontinuance of the LIBO Rate and the adoption of SOFR and/or other alternative based rates could create volatility and instability in the financial markets and within banking and financial institutions. Regardless, we intend to monitor any unforeseen impacts of the discontinuation of the LIBO Rate and the phasing in of SOFR and will attempt to work with our lenders to ensure the transition will have minimal impact on our financial condition. However, we cannot provide any assurances that the impact of the discontinuation of the LIBO Rate and the phasing in of SOFR will not have a material adverse effect on our debt service obligations or our ability to refinance our debt on favorable terms. \n\nThe timing of the cash payments to service the 0% Notes, the 1.625% Notes and the 3.875% Notes is not entirely in our control and may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy these obligations in a timely manner. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding approximately $137.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.625% Notes, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% Notes and $805.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Notes (collectively, the \"Outstanding Notes\"). Holders of the Outstanding Notes have certain rights that would require us to make repurchases prior to the stated maturity for all or a portion of the amounts due in certain circumstances. For example, holders of the 3.875% Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of their 3.875% Notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events accompanied by certain ratings events (as described in the indenture governing the 3.875% Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, accrued prior to, but not including, the repurchase date. \n\nServicing the Outstanding Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under such notes. Our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 1.625% Notes or the 0% Notes, repurchase any of the Outstanding Notes in the case of an applicable repurchase-triggering event under the respective indentures or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. \n\nIn certain circumstances, a takeover of our Company and similar triggering events could also trigger an option of the holders of the 1.625% Notes, the 3.875% Notes and the 0% Notes to require us to repurchase such notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to the holders of the 1.625% Notes, the 3.875% Notes, the 0% Notes and our common stock, which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock. \n\nThe terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and the terms of the 3.875% Notes limit the amount of future indebtedness secured by liens that we may incur. If we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above. Our decision to use our cash for other purposes, such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock, could also intensify these risks. \n\nNote hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. \n\nConcurrently with the issuances of the 1.625% Notes and the 0% Notes, respectively, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties with respect to the 1.625% Notes and the 0% Notes. The warrant \n\ntransactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds $30.70, with respect to the 1.625% Notes, and $74.34, with respect to the 0% Notes. \n\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions for the 1.625% Notes and the 0% Notes, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of such notes. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. \n\nCounterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions, if realized, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. \n\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. \n\nTo the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions, we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1.625% Notes and/or the 0% Notes and/or cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 1.625% Notes and/or the 0% Notes, as the case may be. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock. Any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Common Stock \n\nProvisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our Company, which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. \n\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions: \n\n&#8226; establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; \n\n&#8226; authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that our Board of Directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt; and \n\n&#8226; require the approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock to amend certain of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws. \n\nAlthough we believe these provisions make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our Company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock. \n\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases are affected by a number of factors and may fluctuate. \n\nAlthough we have adopted a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all. The amount, timing, and purchases under our share repurchase program, if any, are influenced by many factors and may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash and because of changes in tax laws, and the market price of our common stock. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions (including the acquisition of GFUS's East Fishkill, New York site and fabrication facilities and the acquisition of GTAT, a producer of SiC-based products and technology) and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Successful acquisitions and alliances in our industry require, among other things, efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts, often in markets or regions in which we have less experience. Risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include, but are not limited to: (1) the ability to integrate information technology and other systems; (2) issues not discovered in our due diligence; (3) customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company; (4) diversion of management&#8217;s attention from our day to day operations; and (5) loss of key employees post-integration. In addition, we may incur unexpected costs or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business. Missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions, which could be caused by factors outside of our control, or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nDepending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business, we may be required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and SEC rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements. The acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems, any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. Any revisions to, inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nDownturns or volatility in general economic conditions, as well as general macroeconomic trends and impacts, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nHistorically, worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impacts of financial crises, subsequent recoveries and persistent economic uncertainty. Recent global economic slowdowns could continue and potentially result in certain economies dipping into economic recessions, including in the United States. In addition, we are aware of and are monitoring the economic environment and related forecasts, which suggest (in certain parts of the world) an economic slowdown. \n\nWe have in the past and could in the future experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions; the onset of an economic recession and volatile or uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact our sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Furthermore, inflationary pressure and increases in interest rates may increase our costs, which could negatively impact revenue, earnings and demand for our products. \n\nIn addition to general economic conditions, impacts of other macroeconomic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, climate change and other natural disasters, and uncertainties in global financial markets, could materially adversely impact our operations by causing disruptions in the geographies in which we and our suppliers, third party distributors and sub-contractors operate. If any of these events impact our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption. Such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow. \n\nRegulatory and legislative developments related to climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. \n\nVarious jurisdictions are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as heightened investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions or \n\nmeet the requirements of our customers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, or parties may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. Any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or others in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nExecutive Overview \n\nThis executive overview presents summarized information regarding our business and operating trends only. For further information relating to the information summarized herein, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in its entirety. \n\nonsemi Results \n\nOur revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $8,326.2 million, an increase of 23.5% from $6,739.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to our strategy to focus on a product mix that yields higher margins, and an increase in average selling prices driven by strong market demand. During 2022, we reported net income attributable to onsemi of $1,902.2 million compared to $1,009.6 million in 2021. Our operating income totaled $2,360.0 million during 2022 compared to $1,287.6 million during 2021. The increase in our operating income and net income was due to significantly better gross margins primarily driven by higher revenue in focused end-markets, favorable product mix, increase in average selling prices and savings from restructuring activities. Our gross margin increased by approximately 870 basis points to 49.0% in 2022 from 40.3% in 2021. See discussion under \"Results of Operations\" for additional discussion on the reasons for the fluctuations year over year. \n\nBusiness and Macroeconomic Environment \n\nThe semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical, has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions, and may experience uncertainty and volatility in the future. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, our product demand remained strong as we achieved record annual revenues. However, we are aware of and are monitoring the economic environment and related forecasts, which suggest global economic slowdowns could continue and potentially result in certain economies entering a recessionary period, which could include the United States. Given the current conditions, we are actively managing our manufacturing activity and spending to align with our forecasted demand. We believe the current volatility in general economic conditions is not expected to have a significant impact on our long-term strategic and growth initiatives. \n\nDuring 2022, we achieved revenue growth as well as expanded our gross margin and operating margin. The semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain. In some cases, we have been able to increase our prices and pass these increased costs along to our customers, which also partially contributed to higher revenue for 2022. We expect to continue to evaluate cost-saving initiatives to be able to align our overall cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue, spending and capacity levels to help offset increased costs. We have taken, and continue to take actions, including but not limited to, exiting product lines, that do not support our gross margin improvements and strategic objectives. \n\nSee Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information relating to our most recent cost-saving initiatives. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nA discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 is included below. For a discussion and comparison of the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on February 14, 2022. \n\nOperating Results \n\nThe following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Change Revenue $ 8,326.2 $ 6,739.8 $ 1,586.4 Cost of revenue 4,249.0 4,025.5 223.5 Gross profit 4,077.2 2,714.3 1,362.9 Operating expenses: Research and development 600.2 655.0 (54.8) Selling and marketing 287.9 293.6 (5.7) General and administrative 343.2 304.8 38.4 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 81.2 99.0 (17.8) Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges, net 17.9 71.4 (53.5) Goodwill and intangible asset impairment 386.8 2.9 383.9 Total operating expenses 1,717.2 1,426.7 290.5 Operating income 2,360.0 1,287.6 1,072.4 Other income (expense), net: Interest expense (94.9) (130.4) 35.5 Interest income 15.5 1.4 14.1 Loss on debt refinancing and prepayment (7.1) (29.0) 21.9 Gain on divestiture of businesses 67.0 10.2 56.8 Other income, net 21.7 18.0 3.7 Other income (expense), net 2.2 (129.8) 132.0 Income before income taxes 2,362.2 1,157.8 1,204.4 Income tax provision benefit (458.4) (146.6) (311.8) Net income 1,903.8 1,011.2 892.6 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interest (1.6) (1.6) &#8212; Net income attributable to ON Semiconductor Corporation $ 1,902.2 $ 1,009.6 $ 892.6 ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue \n\nRevenue was $8,326.2 million and $6,739.8 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase from 2021 to 2022 of $1,586.4 million, or 23.5%, w as attributable to a 22.4%, 18.4% and 41.7% i ncrease in revenue in PSG, ASG and ISG, respectively, which is further explained below. \n\nWe had one customer, a distributor, whose revenue accounted for approximately 12% of the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nRevenue by operating and reportable segments was as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 As a % of Revenue (1) 2021 As a % of Revenue (1) PSG $ 4,208.2 50.5 % $ 3,439.1 51.0 % ASG 2,841.3 34.1 % 2,399.9 35.6 % ISG 1,276.7 15.3 % 900.8 13.4 % Total revenue $ 8,326.2 $ 6,739.8 ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts. \n\nRevenue from PSG \n\nRevenue from PSG increased by $769.1 million, or approximately 22.4%, during 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue from our Advanced Power Division and our Integrated Circuits, Protection and Signal Division increased by $672.7 million and $96.4 million, respectively. Thes e increases primarily were driven by our strategy to focus on SiC, a product mix that yields higher margins and an increase in average selling prices driven by strong market demand. \n\nRevenue from ASG \n\nRevenue from ASG increased by $441.4 million, or approximately 18.4%, during 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue from our Automotive Division, Industrial Solutions Division and Mobile, Computing and Cloud Division increased by $224.2 million, $173.8 million and $77.1 million, respectively. The increases primarily were due to our strategy to focus on a product mix that yields higher margins, and an increase in average selling prices driven by strong market demand. \n\nRevenue from ISG \n\nRevenue from ISG increased by $375.9 million, or approximately 41.7%, during 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue from our Automotive Sensing Division and our Industrial and Consumer Solutions Division increased by $357.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively. The increase in revenue was due to our strategy to focus on a product mix that yields higher margins, and an increase in average selling prices driven by strong market demand . \n\nRevenue by Geographic Location \n\nRevenue by geographic location, based on sales billed from the respective country or regions, are as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 As a % of Revenue (1) 2021 As a % of Revenue (1) Hong Kong $ 2,315.8 27.8 % $ 1,828.6 27.1 % Singapore 2,133.9 25.6 % 2,097.8 31.1 % United Kingdom 1,492.3 17.9 % 1,123.6 16.7 % United States 1,464.7 17.6 % 931.6 13.8 % Other 919.5 11.0 % 758.2 11.2 % Total Revenue $ 8,326.2 $ 6,739.8 ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts. \n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin \n\nOur gross profit by operating and reportable segment was as follows (dollars in millions): ##TABLE_START 2022 As a % of Segment Revenue (1) 2021 As a % of Segment Revenue (1) PSG $ 1,994.3 47.4 % $ 1,318.3 38.3 % ASG 1,474.5 51.9 % 1,055.6 44.0 % ISG 608.4 47.7 % 340.4 37.8 % Total gross profit $ 4,077.2 49.0 % $ 2,714.3 40.3 % ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) Certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts. \n\nOur gross profit increased by $1,362.9 million, or approximately 50%, from $2,714.3 million during 2021 to $4,077.2 million during 2022. Gross margin increased to 49.0% during 2022 compared to 40.3% during 2021. \n\nThe significant increases in gross profit and gross margin were primarily driven by higher revenue, particularly in the \n\nautomotive and industrial end-markets, and a favorable product mix, which included price increases to resolve price-to-value discrepancies for our products. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nResearch and Development \n\nResearch and development expenses were $600.2 million and $655.0 million, or approximately 7% and 10% of revenue for 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of $54.8 million, or approximately 8% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in payroll and other related expenses associated with the wind down of QCS. \n\nSelling and Marketing \n\nSelling and marketing expenses were $287.9 million and $293.6 million, or approximately 3% and 4% of revenue for 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of $5.7 million, or approximately 2% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in payroll-related expenses due to census declines from hiring delays and attrition. \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $343.2 million and $304.8 million, or approximately 4% and 5% of revenue for 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of $38.4 million, or approximately 13% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation and stock compensation. \n\nAmortization of Acquisition&#8212;Related Intangible Assets \n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $81.2 million and $99.0 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of $17.8 million, or approximately 18.0%, year-over-year. The decrease was due to the reduction in amortization expense as certain intangible technology-related assets became fully amortized in 2021 and the full write-off of QCS intangibles. \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net \n\nRestructuring, asset impairments and other charges, net was $17.9 million and $71.4 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Charges in 2022 represent severance charges, contract termination costs and litigation expenses and primarily relate to the QCS wind down. Amounts incurred during 2021 primarily related to the involuntary severance plan. For additional information, see Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment \n\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment was $386.8 million and $2.9 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $330.0 million and an intangible asset impairment charge of $56.8 million, as a result of a shift in our focus on long-term product mix in our strategic markets and the QCS wind down. See Note 6: ''Goodwill and Intangible Assets'' in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nOther Income and Expenses \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense decreased by $35.5 million, or approximately 27.2%, to $94.9 million during 2022 compared to $130.4 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the lack of amortization of debt discount on our convertible notes due to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the effect of the issuance of the 0% Notes, as a majority of the proceeds were utilized to repay higher rate debt. Our average gross amount of long-term debt balance (including current maturities) during 2022 and 2021 was $3,243.3 million and $3,423.9 million, respectively. Our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of long-term debt (including current maturities) was 2.9% and 3.8% per annum in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Key Financing and Capital Events\" below and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of our indebtedness and \n\nour refinancing activities. \n\nGain on Divestiture of Businesses \n\nGain on divestiture of business was $67.0 million in 2022, compared to $10.2 million in 2021. The gain during 2022 relates to the divestiture of the wafer manufacturing facilities in Niigata, Japan, Pocatello, Idaho, South Portland, Maine and Oudenaarde, Belgium. \n\nLoss on Debt Refinancing and Prepayment \n\nWe recorded loss on debt refinancing and prepayment of $7.1 million during 2022. This was primarily related to the partial prepayment of the Term Loan \"B\" Facility. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Key Financing and Capital Events\" below and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of our indebtedness and our refinancing activities. \n\nOther income, net \n\nOther income, net was $18.0 million in 2021 compared to an income of $21.7 million in 2022, reflecting a change of approximately 20.6%. The increase was primarily due to the fluctuations in foreign currencies resulting in increased transaction gains offset by losses on hedges that were realized. \n\nIncome Tax Provision \n\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $458.4 million and $146.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 19.4% and 12.7%. The increase in our effective tax rate was substantially driven by the impact of nondeductible goodwill and foreign operations. \n\nFor additional information, see Note 16: ''Income Taxes'' and Note 6: ''Goodwill and Intangible Assets'' in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nOverview \n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, funds from external borrowings and debt and equity issuances. In the near term, we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and with cash and cash equivalents on hand. We also have the ability to utilize our Revolving Credit Facility, which has approximately $1.5 billion available for future borrowings. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $2,919.0 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nWe require cash to: (i) fund our operating expenses, working capital requirements, outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments; (ii) service our debt, including principal and interest; (iii) conduct research and development; (iv) incur capital expenditures; and (v) repurchase our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities on a regular basis. \n\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment, and can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted. \n\nWe believe that the key factors that could adversely affect our internal and external sources of cash include: \n\n&#8226; Changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, supply chain constraints, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, our ability to make progress on the achievement of our business strategy and sustainability goals, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and \n\n&#8226; The debt and equity capital markets could impact our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to \n\nrespond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time. \n\nSources and Uses of Cash \n\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities on a regular basis. Excluded from the discussion below is the EFK facility, which we acquired on December 31, 2022 for $406.3 million in cash, of which approximately $236.3 million was paid in January 2023. See Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nThe following are the significant sources and uses of cash during 2022: \n\n&#8226; Our cash flows from operating activities were $2,633.1 million . \n\n&#8226; We paid approximately $1,005.0 million for capital expenditures. \n\n&#8226; Borrowing of $500.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, the net proceeds of which were used to prepay the outstanding balance of $500.0 million under the Term Loan \"B\" Facility. \n\n&#8226; Repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $259.8 million. \n\n&#8226; Divestiture of manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium, South Portland, Maine, Pocatello, Idaho and Niigata, Japan for approximately $275.0 million in the aggregate. See Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nOperating Activities \n\nOur long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. Our cash flows from operating activities were $2,633.1 million, $1,782.0 million and $884.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Our operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $851.1 million, or 47.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 and was primarily attributable to a significant increase in net income due to our strategy to focus on a product mix that yields higher margins combined with increased demand and prices for our products. \n\nOur ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets. Management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nOur cash flows used in investing activities were $705.4 million, $915.1 million and $453.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The decrease of $209.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate and divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid $1,005.0 million, $444.6 million and $383.6 million, respectively, for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures as a percent of revenue increased in 2022 to 12%, primarily as a result of the silicon carbide expansion and our facility expansion investments. In 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 20% of revenue as these investments along with other capital initiatives will increase. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nOur cash flows used in financing activities were $370.0 million, $569.4 million and $244.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The decrease of $199.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to proceeds and payments related to long-term borrowings and share repurchase activity. \n\nSee Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information related to liquidity matters. \n\nDebt \n\nOur ability to service our long-term debt, including our 0% Notes, 3.875% Notes, 1.625% Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan \"B\" Facility, to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to, among other things, our future operating performance, as well as to financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $1,086.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan \"B\" Facility, in addition to $805.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 0% Notes, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Notes and $137.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% Notes. The aggregate principal amount of outstanding 1.625% Notes, net of unamortized discount and issuance costs, has been reclassified as a current portion of long-term debt. The associated interest expense related to this indebtedness will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations. \n\nSee Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' and Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nKey Financing and Capital Events \n\nOverview \n\nWe continually evaluate our debt and capital structure and when appropriate, we have completed various measures to secure liquidity, repurchase shares of our common stock, reduce interest costs, amend existing key financing arrangements and, in some cases, extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility. Certain of these measures continued in 2022, which included the partial repayment of our Term Loan through borrowings of $500.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and the amendment of our credit agreement to eliminate the LIBO Rate as a borrowing alternative. For further discussion of our debt instruments, see Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' and for further discussion on the Share Repurchase Program (as defined below), see Note 10: ''Earnings Per Share and Equity'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\n2022 Financing Events \n\n&#8226; In connection with the Company&#8217;s $500.0 million draw down on the Revolving Credit Facility, we expensed $7.3 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs primarily attributed to a partial pay-down of debt as loss on debt refinancing and prepayment. \n\n&#8226; Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program amounted to $259.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; On November 9, 2022, we entered into separate privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 1.625% Notes to repurchase or exchange, as applicable, $16.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% Notes for a total consideration of $16.0 million in cash and 552,000 shares of common stock. \n\n&#8226; On November 16, 2022, we entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement to transition the interest rate base from the LIBO Rate to Term SOFR. \n\n2021 Financing Events \n\n&#8226; In May 2021, we completed a private offering of $805.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 0% Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the initial purchasers of the 0% Notes or their affiliates (\"Counterparties\") and paid $160.3 million in cash for the convertible note hedges. We also entered into warrant transactions with the Counterparties and received $93.8 million in cash for the sale of warrants. \n\n&#8226; Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 0% Notes, we entered into separate privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 1.625% Notes to repurchase or exchange, as applicable, $372.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.625% Notes for a total consideration of $506.5 million in cash and 5.4 million shares of common stock. In December 2021, we repurchased $47.4 million of the 1.625% Notes for $47.4 million in cash and 1.6 million \n\nshares of common stock. \n\n&#8226; During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid the outstanding balance of $700.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 0% Notes and cash on hand. \n\n2020 Financing Events \n\n&#8226; The 1.00% Notes matured on December 1, 2020. The maturity of the notes resulted in us paying $690.0 million in cash, to holders of the 1.00% Notes using our available cash and cash equivalents. The excess over the principal amount was settled by issuing shares of common stock held in treasury. At the time of issuance of the 1.00% Notes, we concurrently entered into hedge transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 1.00% Notes, and accordingly, repurchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at fair market value, to effectively offset the issuance of shares. Also at the time of issuance of the 1.00% Notes, we sold warrants to certain bank counterparties whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase from us the equivalent number of shares of our common stock at a price of $25.96 per share. All these warrants were exercised by the holders during the first and second quarters of 2021 and were settled by issuing an aggregate of 13.4 million shares of common stock. \n\n&#8226; In August 2020, we completed a private offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.875% Notes due 2028. In connection with the issuance, we incurred original issue discount and debt issuance costs amounting to $9.4 million. \n\n&#8226; In March 2020, we borrowed $1,165.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and provide financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to better macroeconomic and business conditions, we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.875% Notes along with cash on hand to repay $1,200.0 million of outstanding borrowings with the remaining $65.0 million balance we repaid $65.0 million on December 31, 2020. \n\n&#8226; During 2020, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $65.3 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. \n\nDebt Guarantees and Related Covenants \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 0% Notes, 3.875% Notes and 1.625% Notes and with covenants relating to our Term Loan \"B\" Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. Our 0% Notes, 3.875% Notes and 1.625% Notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of onsemi and our guarantor subsidiaries and rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and as unsecured obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt. Failure to comply with any of our covenants or any other terms of our Term Loan \"B\" Facility and Revolving Credit Facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt. \n\nSee Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. We utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements. In addition to our critical accounting policies below, see Note 2: ''Significant Accounting Policies'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) future payouts for customer incentives and amounts subject to allowances and returns; (ii) valuation and obsolescence relating to inventories; (iii) measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, and \n\nevaluations of uncertain tax positions; (iv) assumptions used in business combinations; and (v) testing for impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. Additionally, during periods where it becomes applicable, significant estimates will be used by management in determining the future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nRevenue Recognition . We generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to direct customers and distributors. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. For sales agreements, we have identified the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the performance obligation. For product development agreements, we have identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement to be the performance obligation. We apply a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative stand-alone selling price. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer. \n\nSales to certain distributors, primarily those with ship and credit rights, can be subject to price adjustment on certain products. We develop an estimate of their expected claims under the ship and credit program based on the historical claims data submitted by product and customer and expected future claims, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the amount of each claim as well as the historical period used to develop the estimate. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur direct customers do not have the right to return products, other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. Sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized, and are netted against revenue. For non-quality related returns, we recognize a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold. We record a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenue, based on the experience with each customer. \n\nInventories . We carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. The determination of projected end-user demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product. These provisions can influence our results from operations. For example, when demand falls for a given part, all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved, impacting our cost of revenue and gross profit. The majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded. However, we do sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been consistently insignificant and the related impact on our margins has also been insignificant. \n\nIncome Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. \n\nIn determining the amount of the valuation allowance, estimated future taxable income, feasible tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary differences and taxable income in prior carryback years, if a carryback is permitted are considered. If we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more \n\nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. No tax benefit is recognized for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained. Our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made, which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate. \n\nBusiness Combination. We use estimates and assumptions in allocating the purchase price of acquired business by utilizing established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. We utilize the income approach, cost approach or market approach, depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data. If the income approach is used, the fair value determination is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life and involves significant assumptions as to cash flows, associated expenses, long-term growth rates and discount rates. The cost approach takes into account the cost to replace (or reproduce) the asset and involves assumptions relating to the asset's value of physical, functional and/or economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset. The market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date. Determining the fair value of acquired technology assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate, revenue growth rates, projected gross margins, and estimated research and development expenses. \n\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Our impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment, and if deemed necessary, a quantitative test is performed which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. \n\nDetermining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected net cash flows, discount and long-term growth rates. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. The assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and industry trends. We consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and long-term growth rates to use in its analysis. We consider other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. \n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses, if applicable, are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. We continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group. The dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests. As we continue to implement our business strategy to rationalize products and manufacturing locations to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model, there could be divestiture transactions resulting in a portion of goodwill or other assets being de-recognized, and which may or may not result in accounting charges. \n\nContingencies . We are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. Based on the available information, we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 4: ''Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our gross long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $3,228.3 million. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $2,392.3 million. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $836.0 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $5.4 million, inclusive of the impact of our interest rate swaps which hedge the risk of variability in the interest payment cash flows on a portion of our variable interest rate debt. Additionally, some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase. \n\nTo ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions. However, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged, we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. Dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. Some of our Japanese operations utilize Japanese Yen as the functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. \n\nWe enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $272.0 million and $288.3 million, respectively. \n\nSubstantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. Dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies, including Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, Euros, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippine Peso and Vietnamese Dong. Due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies, our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the U.S. Dollar. For example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our operating income would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, assuming no offsetting hedge position or correlated activities. \n\nSee Note 15: ''Financial Instruments'' in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further information with respect to our hedging activity. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . \n\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions \n\nregarding required disclosure. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. \n\nWe also carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThere have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. \n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework 2013 . Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nManagement's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 excluded the East Fishkill, New York site and fabrication facility (\"EFK\"), which was acquired in a purchase business combination by the Company on December 31, 2022. EFK's total assets and total revenue excluded from management&#8217;s assessment represent 3.4% and 0%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\" of this Form 10-K. \n\n"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded East Fishkill, New York site and fabrication facilities (\"EFK\") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded EFK from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. EFK's total assets and total revenue excluded from management&#8217;s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 3.4% and 0%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \n\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nValuation of Inventories \n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s inventory balance of $1,616.8 million as of December 31, 2022, is stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Management writes down excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in developing the write down for excess and obsolete inventories. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s analysis, including the inputs utilized and the significant assumptions related to projected end-user demand employed within the analysis. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of inventories. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the write down for excess and obsolete inventories, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the analysis, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to projected end-user demand used by management in developing the write down for excess and obsolete inventories. Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions related to projected end-user demand involved considering the performance of product sales and whether they were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nPhoenix, Arizona \n\nFebruary 6, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1999. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n\n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,919.0 &#160;

PSG; \n\n&#8226; ASG; and \n\n&#8226; ISG. \n\nUnless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current-period presentation. \n\nNote 2: Significant Accounting Policies \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Investments in affiliates where the Company does not exert a controlling financial interest are not consolidated. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on experience, current and expected future conditions, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) future payouts for customer incentives and amounts subject to allowances and returns; (ii) valuation and obsolescence relating to inventories; (iii) measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, and evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (iv) assumptions used in business combinations; and (v) testing for impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. Additionally, during periods where it becomes applicable, significant estimates will be used by management in determining the future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill and in assumptions used in connection with business combinations. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less. The Company maintains amounts on deposit at various financial institutions, which may at times exceed federally insured limits. However, management periodically evaluates the credit-worthiness of those institutions and has not experienced any losses on such deposits. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. General market conditions, as well as the Company's design activities, can cause certain of its products to become obsolete. The Company writes down excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. The determination of projected end-user demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product. These write downs can influence results from operations. For example, when demand for a given part falls, all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nexcess of anticipated demand is written down, impacting cost of revenue and gross profit. However, the majority of product inventory that has been previously written down is ultimately discarded. Although the Company does sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been consistently insignificant and the related impact on the Company's gross profit has also been insignificant. \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 30 years for buildings and 3 - 20 years for computers, machinery and equipment using straight-line methods. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the period in which the expense is incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period realized. \n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. A potential impairment charge is evaluated when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived from an asset group are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses, if applicable, are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value. Judgment is used when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of the asset group. \n\nBusiness Combination Purchase Price Allocation \n\nThe allocation of the purchase price of business combinations is based on management estimates and assumptions, which utilize established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry. These techniques include the income approach, cost approach or market approach, depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data. Management records the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. If the income approach is used, the fair value determination is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life. The cost approach takes into account the cost to replace (or reproduce) the asset and the effects on the asset's value of physical, functional and/or economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset. The market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual market transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date. Determining the fair value of acquired technology assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate, revenue growth rates, projected gross margins, and estimated research and development and other operating expenses. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The Company&#8217;s divisions are one level below the operating segments, constituting individual businesses, at which level the Company&#8217;s segment management conducts regular reviews of the operating results. The Company's divisions, either individually or in a combination, constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill. \n\nThe Company's impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment. If this assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. Otherwise, a quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company can bypass the qualitative assessment for any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of the net assets associated with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, goodwill is considered impaired and will be determined as the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \n\nDetermining the fair value of the Company's reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected net cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units based on an income approach derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. The assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and industry trends. The Company considers historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and long-term growth rates to use in its analysis. The Company considers other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nIntangible Assets \n\nThe Company's acquisitions have resulted in intangible assets consisting of values assigned to customer relationships, patents, developed technology, licenses, and trademarks, which are considered long-lived assets and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. These intangible assets, which are considered long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group containing these assets may not be recoverable. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating and financing lease arrangements are comprised primarily of real estate and equipment agreements for which the right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets are included in other assets and the corresponding lease liabilities, depending on their maturity, are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments considering the term of the lease, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, giving consideration to publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \n\nDebt Issuance Costs \n\nDebt issuance costs for the Company's Revolving Credit Facility are capitalized and amortized over the term of the facility on a straight-line basis. Amortization is included in interest expense while the unamortized balance is included in other assets. \n\nDebt issuance costs for the Company's convertible notes, senior notes and term debt are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amounts of such debt, consistent with debt discounts, and are amortized over their term using the effective interest method. Amortization is included in interest expense. \n\nContingencies \n\nThe Company is involved in a variety of legal matters, IP matters, environmental, financing and indemnification contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on the information available, management evaluates the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and records the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable. \n\nTreasury Stock \n\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost, inclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, when outstanding common shares are repurchased, bond hedges issued in connection with the convertible notes are settled and when outstanding shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with certain shares pursuant to RSUs under the Company's share-based compensation plans. Re-issuance of shares held in treasury stock is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company generates revenue from sales of its semiconductor products to direct customers and distributors. The Company also generates revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. Revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled. For sales agreements, the Company has identified the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, as the performance obligation. For product development agreements, the Company has identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement as the performance obligation. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nidentifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. \n\nSales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply. In the absence of a sales agreement, the Company&#8217;s standard terms and conditions apply. The Company considers the customer purchase orders, governed by sales agreements or the Company&#8217;s standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer. The Company evaluates certain factors including the customer&#8217;s ability to pay (or credit risk). \n\nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative stand-alone selling price. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company&#8217;s direct customers do not have the right to return products, other than pursuant to the provisions of the Company&#8217;s standard warranty. Sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Sales to certain distributors, primarily those with ship and credit rights, can also be subject to price adjustment on certain products. Although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days. In addition, the Company offers cash discounts to certain customers for payments received within an agreed upon time, generally ten days after shipment, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue. \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from sales agreements upon transferring control of a product to the customer, which typically occurs when products are shipped or delivered, depending on the delivery terms, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are consumed. The Company recognizes revenue from product development agreements over time based on the cost-to-cost method. Revenue is also recognized over time for products with no alternative use and an enforceable right to payment as they are manufactured, which represents a contract asset. The Company can receive cash payments from customers in advance of the Company&#8217;s performance obligation being satisfied, which represents a contract liability. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Sales returns and allowances, which include ship and credit reserves for distributors, are estimated based on historical claims data and expected future claims. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized, and are netted against revenue. \n\nFrequently, the Company receives orders with multiple delivery dates that may extend across reporting periods. Each delivery constitutes an individual performance obligation, which consists of transferring control of the products to the customers based on their stand-alone selling price. The Company invoices the customer for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenue in accordance with delivery terms. As scheduled delivery dates are within one year , revenue allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed. The Company records freight and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost and includes it in cost of revenue. Taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value-added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenue). \n\nThe Company generally warrants that products sold to its customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to specifications. The Company&#8217;s standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery, except in the case of image sensor products, which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with its sales and records them as a component of the cost of revenue. \n\nResearch and Development Costs \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nIn determining the amount of the valuation allowance, estimated future taxable income, feasible tax planning strategies, future reversals of existing temporary differences and taxable income in prior carryback years, if a carryback is permitted, are considered. If the Company determines it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if the Company determines it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense. \n\nThe Company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. No tax benefit is recognized for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained. The Company's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in significant increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made, which could have a significant impact to the Company's effective tax rate. \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Currencies \n\n&#160; \n\nMost of the Company's foreign subsidiaries conduct business primarily in U.S. dollars and, as a result, utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. For the remeasurement of financial statements of these subsidiaries, assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are receivable or payable in cash are remeasured at current exchange rates, while inventories and other non-monetary assets in foreign currencies are remeasured at historical rates. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of such financial statements are included in the operating results, as are gains and losses incurred on foreign currency transactions. \n\n&#160; \n\nSome of the Company's Japanese subsidiaries utilize Japanese Yen as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates in effect for the period. The related translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income or loss within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company maintains defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its foreign employees. Net periodic pension costs and pension obligations are determined based on actuarial assumptions, including discount rates for plan obligations, assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increases for employees participating in plans. These assumptions are based upon management's judgment and consultation with actuaries, considering all known trends and uncertainties. The service cost component of the net periodic pension cost is allocated between the cost of revenue, research and development, selling and marketing and general and administrative line items, while the other components are included in other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nFair Value Measurement \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company measures certain of its financial and non-financial assets at fair value by using the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes certain inputs into individual fair value measurement approaches. The fair value hierarchy, which is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third, unobservable. The Company has elected not to carry any of its debt instruments at fair value. \n\nNote 3: Revenue and Segment Information \n\nRevenue recognized for product sales amounted to $ 8,306.1 million, $ 6,719.9 million and $ 5,227.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue recognized for product development agreements amounted to $ 20.1 million, $ 19.9 million and $ 27.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nA significant portion of the Company&#8217;s orders are firm commitments that are non-cancellable, including certain orders or contracts with a duration of less than one year. Certain of the Company's customer contracts are multi-year agreements that \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\ninclude firmly committed amounts (\"Long-term Supply Agreements\" or \"LTSA's\") for which the remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $ 16.6 billion (excluding the remaining performance obligations for contracts having a duration of one year or less). The Company expects to recognize approximately 31 % of this amount as revenue during the next twelve months upon shipment of products under these contracts. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and demand quantities, and could be influenced by manufacturing issues, supply chain constraints, and modifications to customer agreements, among other things. Accordingly, the amount represented by remaining performance obligations may not be indicative of the actual revenue recognized for future periods. \n\nA portion of our LTSA&#8217;s include non-cancellable capacity payments which secure production availability for our customers' orders or represent deposits, which prepay a portion of a given customer&#8217;s product obligation. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded capacity payments of $ 162.9 million and $ 57.1 million, respectively, which were recorded within contract liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 8.4 million and $ 11.5 million, respectively, of the capacity payments were recorded in accounts receivable. Capacity payments totaled $ 190.4 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $ 60.5 million and $ 129.9 million were recorded as current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Contract assets were $ 2.3 million as of December 31, 2022, and there were no contract assets as of December 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022, $ 23.8 million and an immaterial amount, respectively, was recognized as revenue for satisfying the associated performance obligations. \n\nThe Company is organized into three operating and reportable segments consisting of PSG, ASG and ISG. The operating costs of manufacturing facilities which service all business units are reflected in the segments' cost of revenue on the basis of product costs. Because operating segments are generally defined by the products they design and sell, they do not sell to each other. The Company does not allocate income taxes or interest expense to its operating segments as the operating segments are principally evaluated on gross profit. Additionally, restructuring, asset impairments and other charges, net and certain other operating expenses, which include corporate research and development costs and miscellaneous nonrecurring expenses are not allocated to segments. In addition to the operating and reportable segments, the Company also operates global operations, sales and marketing, information systems and finance and administration groups. A portion of the expenses for each of these groups are allocated to the segments based on specific and general criteria. \n\nRevenue and gross profit for the Company&#8217;s operating and reportable segments are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START PSG ASG ISG Total For year ended December 31, 2022: Revenue from external customers $ 4,208.2 &#160; $ 2,841.3 &#160; $ 1,276.7 &#160; $ 8,326.2 &#160; Segment gross profit 1,994.3 &#160; 1,474.5 &#160; 608.4 &#160; 4,077.2 &#160; For year ended December 31, 2021: Revenue from external customers $ 3,439.1 &#160; $ 2,399.9 &#160; $ 900.8 &#160; $ 6,739.8 &#160; Segment gross profit 1,318.3 &#160; 1,055.6 &#160; 340.4 &#160; 2,714.3 &#160; For year ended December 31, 2020: Revenue from external customers $ 2,606.1 &#160; $ 1,910.4 &#160; $ 738.5 &#160; $ 5,255.0 &#160; Segment gross profit (1) 764.1 &#160; 714.4 &#160; 237.3 &#160; 1,715.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) Beginning in 2021, the Company started including unallocated manufacturing costs as part of segment operating results to determine segment gross profit.

Sales to unaffiliated customers have little correlation with the location of the Company's manufacturing. It is, therefore, not meaningful to present operating profit by geographical location. The Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. The Company&#8217;s consolidated assets are not specifically ascribed to its individual reportable segments.

Entities will not separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature in such debt and will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt, unless certain other conditions are met. Also, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method, and recorded adjustments to reduce additional paid-in capital by $ 129.1 million and increased opening retained earnings by $ 27.1 million to reflect the cumulative effect of the adoption.

(\"GTAT\") Acquisition \n\nOn October 28, 2021, the Company acquired all of outstanding equity interests of GTAT. The Company believes the acquisition of GTAT will act as a building block to fuel growth and accelerate innovation in disruptive intelligent power technologies and secure supply of SiC to meet growing customer demand for SiC-based solutions in the sustainable ecosystem. \n\nPursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the purchase price totaled $ 434.9 million. Cash consideration amounted to $ 424.6 million, of which $ 17.0 million was deposited for general representation and warranty purposes in an escrow account, legally owned by the Company. The remaining consideration of approximately $ 10.0 million represented the value of certain pre-acquisition deposits and payable balances effectively settled between the parties since the Company was GTAT's customer. From the closing date of the acquisition through December 31, 2021, the Company recognized immaterial revenue and net loss relating to GTAT. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, $ 5.8 million of the restricted cash balance remained in escrow relating to the acquisition of GTAT and will be released to the former stockholders of GTAT upon satisfaction of the remaining outstanding items contained in the acquisition agreement. \n\nThe allocation of the purchase price of GTAT to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Purchase Price Allocation Cash and cash equivalents $ 8.2 &#160; Inventory and other current assets 10.0 &#160; Property, plant and equipment 31.9 &#160; Goodwill 274.8 &#160; Intangible assets - Developed Technology 130.0 &#160; Deferred tax assets 13.4 &#160; Other non-current assets 7.4 &#160; Total assets acquired 475.7 &#160; Current liabilities 5.8 &#160; Other long-term liabilities 35.0 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 40.8 &#160; Net assets acquired/purchase price $ 434.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDeveloped technology of $ 130.0 million, determined using the income approach is estimated to have a useful life of 13 years.

These charges were incurred as a result of the Company&#8217;s failed sale of the QCS division followed by the approved exit plan to wind down the division. The division is generally associated with the Company&#8217;s legacy Quantenna division, representing less than 2.0 % of the Company's consolidated revenue for 2022, less than 3.0 % of the Company's consolidated revenue for 2021 and approximately 3.0 % of the Company's consolidated revenue for 2020. \n\nOf the $ 330.0 million of goodwill impairment charges, $ 115.0 million was recorded during the Company&#8217;s second fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2022, the Company determined that a market approach was the most appropriate method to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, as the Company was attempting to sell this reporting unit to an interested party. For the remainder of the impairment charge recorded in the Company&#8217;s third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company determined that the discounted cash flow method under the income approach was the most appropriate method to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets.

These proceeds were used to prepay $ 500.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan &#8220;B&#8221; Facility. The Company expensed $ 7.3 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs attributed to the partial pay-down as loss on debt refinancing and prepayment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 1.5 billion available under the Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of $ 700.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 0 % Notes and cash generated from operations. \n\nAdoption of ASU 2020-06 \n\nAs described in Note 4: ''Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments,'' during 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using a modified retrospective method and increased long-term debt by eliminating debt discount of $ 135.7 million, reduced additional paid-in capital by $ 129.1 million and increased opening retained earnings by $ 27.1 million to reflect the cumulative effect of adoption as of January 1, 2022. The application of the if-converted method to determine the net income for diluted earnings and diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding did not have a meaningful impact on the diluted net income per share of common stock under the treasury stock method previously applied. \n\n0 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 \n\nOn May 19, 2021, the Company completed a private offering of $ 805.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 0 % Notes, the proceeds of which were used to repurchase a portion of the 1.625 % Notes in privately negotiated note repurchase or exchange transactions, repay a portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, pay the net cost of the related convertible note hedges after such costs were offset by the proceeds from the sale of warrants, and general corporate purposes. The 0 % Notes were offered to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and were issued under an indenture (the \" 0 % Indenture\") by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which provides, among other things, that the 0 % Notes will mature on May 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms. On or after February 1, 2027, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 1, 2027, holders may convert their 0 % Notes at any time. The 0 % Notes are the Company&#8217;s senior unsecured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Company&#8217;s Amended Credit Agreement. The Company may satisfy any conversion elections by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 0 % Notes to be converted, and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company&#8217;s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 0 % Notes to be converted. \n\nThe initial conversion rate of the 0 % Notes is 18.8796 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 52.97 per share of common stock. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 0 % Notes, at the Company&#8217;s option, on or after May 1, 2024, if the last reported sale price of the Company&#8217;s common stock has been at least 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading-day period. Prior to February 1, 2027, the holders may convert their 0 % Notes under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five consecutive business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 0 % Notes for each trading day of such period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of Company&#8217;s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if the Company calls any or all of the 0 % Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the 0 % Indenture. \n\nThe conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the 0 % Indenture. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable in connection with the conversion is 21.7 million. In accordance with the accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, the Company valued and bifurcated the conversion option, representing the debt discount, from the respective host debt instrument and recorded $ 139.9 million to stockholders&#8217; equity. The debt discount represented the borrowing rate for non-convertible debt as of the date of issuance with similar maturity. The Company also incurred issuance costs of $ 19.0 million, of which $ 15.7 million was capitalized as debt issuance costs and \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\n$ 3.3 million was allocated to the conversion option and recorded to stockholders&#8217; equity. The debt discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized at an effective interest rate of 3.2 % over the contractual term of six years under the existing accounting standard. The carrying amount of the equity component, unamortized discount and issuance costs, and the net carrying amount of the liability component as of December 31, 2021 were $ 143.2 million, $ 140.2 million and $ 664.8 million, respectively. The interest cost relating to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 3.2 million and $ 15.3 million, respectively. The 0 % Notes if-converted value exceeded its principal amount by $ 142.9 million as of December 31, 2022, calculated using the stock price on that date. \n\nIn addition, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to the common stock with the initial purchasers of the 0 % Notes or their affiliates (\"Counterparties\"). The convertible note hedges cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the 0 % Notes, and are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the common stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount upon conversion. The Company paid $ 160.3 million in cash for the convertible note hedges and recorded them as a reduction to stockholders&#8217; equity. The Company applied ASC 815-40 - \"Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity\" and concluded that the convertible note hedges should be classified in stockholders&#8217; equity with no subsequent remeasurement. \n\nThe Company also entered into warrant transactions with the Counterparties, whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the same number of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock covered by the convertible note hedges at an initial strike price of $ 74.34 per share, which represents a 100 % premium over the closing price of $ 37.17 per share on May 11, 2021. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable in connection with the warrants is 30.4 million. The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 815-40 - \"Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity\" and determined that the instrument met the criteria for classification as an equity transaction with no subsequent remeasurement. The Company received $ 93.8 million in cash for the sale of warrants, which was recorded as an increase to stockholders&#8217; equity. \n\nAmendments to the Amended Credit Agreement \n\nThe Company entered into the Amended Credit Agreement in 2016 which provides for a $ 1.97 billion revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and a $ 2.4 billion term loan \"B\" facility (the &#8220;Term Loan \"B\" Facility&#8221;). Between 2016 and 2021, the Company, the Guarantors (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), the several lenders party thereto and the Agent (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) entered into ten amendments to the Amended Credit Agreement. These amendments, among others, reduced the interest rates payable and increased the amounts that may be borrowed under the Term Loan \"B\" Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility and also amended certain financial covenants. \n\nSince 2016, the Company has amended the Amended Credit Agreement to allow for the following items: \n\n&#8226; On November 16, 2022, the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement to transition the interest rate base from the LIBO Rate to Term SOFR. The Company accounted for the amendment by applying the provisions of ASC 848 - \"Reference Rate Reform.\" \n\n&#8226; On May 10, 2021, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement to permit the issuance of the 0 % Notes and the repurchase or exchange of the 1.625 % Notes \n\n&#8226; On June 23, 2020, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement to change certain defined terms and to modify certain terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement to align with the domestication of certain foreign subsidiaries. \n\nThere was no impact to the consolidated financial statements due to the amendments noted above. \n\nThe obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and collateralized by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests in certain of the Company&#8217;s domestic and first tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are also collateralized by mortgage on certain real property assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. \n\nThe Amended Credit Agreement includes a maximum total net leverage ratio as a financial maintenance covenant, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2022. It also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nPartial repurchase or exchange of the 1.625 % Notes/Loss on debt refinancing and prepayment \n\nOn May 11, 2021, contemporaneously with the issuance of the 0 % Notes, the Company entered into separate privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 1.625 % Notes to repurchase or exchange, as applicable, $ 372.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.625 % Notes for a total consideration of $ 506.5 million in cash and 5.4 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The repurchases and exchanges resulted in a loss on debt prepayment of $ 26.2 million based on the fair value of the debt component, while the remainder of the consideration amounting to $ 141.6 million attributable to the equity component was recorded to stockholders&#8217; equity. Separately, the Company received 9.1 million shares into treasury by terminating a portion of the convertible note hedge transactions that were originally entered at the time of issuance of the 1.625 % Notes in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of the 1.625 % Notes repurchased or exchanged and recorded $ 339.0 million to additional paid-in capital and treasury stock, with no overall impact to equity. Additionally, the Company terminated a portion of the warrant transactions originally entered at the time of issuance of the 1.625 % Notes and issued 6.8 million shares with respect to a number of shares of common stock equal to the notional shares underlying such 1.625 % Notes repurchased or exchanged. \n\nOn December 14, 2021, the Company repurchased $ 47.4 million in principal of 1.625 % Notes for total consideration of $ 47.4 million in cash and 1.6 million shares of the Company's common stock. This transaction resulted in a loss on debt prepayment of $ 2.8 million based on the fair value of the debt component, while the remainder of the consideration amounting to $ 0.8 million attributable to the equity component was recorded to stockholders&#8217; equity. Separately, the Company received 1.6 million shares into treasury by terminating a portion of the convertible note hedge transactions that were originally entered at the time of issuance of the 1.625 % Notes in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of the 1.625 % Notes redeemed and recorded $ 102.2 million to additional paid-in capital and treasury stock, with no overall impact to equity. Additionally, the Company terminated a portion of the warrant transactions originally entered at the time of issuance of the 1.625 % Notes and issued 1.3 million shares with respect to a number of shares of common stock equal to the notional shares underlying such 1.625 % Notes redeemed. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into separate privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 1.625 % Notes to repurchase or exchange, as applicable, $ 16.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.625 % Notes for a total consideration of $ 16 million in cash and 552,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. \n\nThe remaining outstanding principal amount of the 1.625 % Notes, amounting to $ 137.3 million, net of unamortized issuance costs, continued to be classified as a current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022. Pursuant to the indenture governing the 1.625 % Notes, because the last reported sale price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on December 31, 2022 was greater than or equal to $ 26.94 ( 130 % of the conversion price) on each applicable trading day, the holders have the right to surrender any portion of their 1.625 % Notes (in minimum denominations of $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) for conversion during the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2023, and only during such calendar quarter. \n\nThe carrying amount of the equity component, unamortized discount and issuance costs, and the net carrying amount of the liability component as of December 31, 2022 were $ 27.6 million, $ 0.3 million and $ 137.0 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the equity component, unamortized discount and issuance costs, and the net carrying amount of the liability component as of December 31, 2021 were $ 31.2 million, $ 10.5 million and $ 144.6 million, respectively. Total interest expense relating to the coupon rate and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 3.0 million, $ 19.6 million and $ 28.7 million, respectively. \n\nThe conversion rate of the 1.625 % Notes is 48.2567 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1.625 % Notes (subject to adjustment in certain events), which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $ 20.72 per share of common stock. The unamortized discount and issuance costs are amortized at an effective interest rate of 5.27 % over the remaining contractual term of approximately two years under the existing accounting standard. The convertible note hedge transactions and warrants issued in connection with the issuance of the 1.625 % Notes were originally classified in stockholders' equity with no subsequent remeasurement using the guidance in ASC 815-40 - \"Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity.\" The 1.625 % Notes if-converted value exceeded its principal amount by $ 276.0 million as of December 31, 2022, calculated using the stock price on that date. \n\nIssuance of 3.875 % Notes \n\nOn August 21, 2020, the Company completed its private offering of $ 700.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.875 % Notes. The 3.875 % Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 3.875 % Notes are fully and \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nunconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries that is a borrower or Guarantor under the Amended Credit Agreement and will also be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by any of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries that becomes a borrower or guarantees any indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement in the future. \n\nThe 3.875 % Notes and the guarantees thereof are the Company&#8217;s and the Guarantors&#8217; general unsecured obligations, respectively, and (i) rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company&#8217;s and the Guarantors&#8217; existing and future senior indebtedness (including the 1.625 % Notes); (ii) rank senior to any subordinated indebtedness that the Company or the Guarantors may incur; (iii) are effectively subordinated to all of the Company&#8217;s or the Guarantors&#8217; existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement), in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries that are not Guarantors of the 3.875 % Notes. \n\nThe 3.875 % Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.875 % per year, payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and will mature on September 1, 2028, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company. The original issue discount and debt issuance costs incurred by the Company in connection with the offering of the 3.875 % Notes amounted to $ 9.4 million, which has been capitalized and will be amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of September 1, 2028. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.875 % Notes were used entirely to repay borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\nNote 10: Earnings Per Share and Equity \n\nEarnings Per Share \n\nNet income per share of common stock attributable to ON Semiconductor Corporation is shown below (in millions, except per share data): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net income for basic earnings per share of common stock $ 1,902.2 &#160; $ 1,009.6 &#160; $ 234.2 &#160; Add: Interest on 1.625 % Notes \n\n2.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net income for diluted earnings per share of common stock $ 1,904.2 &#160; $ 1,009.6 &#160; $ 234.2 &#160; Basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 433.2 &#160; 425.7 &#160; 410.7 &#160; Dilutive effect of share-based awards 1.8 &#160; 2.5 &#160; 1.9 &#160; Dilutive effect of convertible notes and warrants 13.2 &#160; 15.6 &#160; 6.2 &#160; Diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 448.2 &#160; 443.8 &#160; 418.8 &#160; Net income per share of common stock: Basic $ 4.39 &#160; $ 2.37 &#160; $ 0.57 &#160; Diluted $ 4.25 &#160; $ 2.27 &#160; $ 0.56 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nBasic income per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. To calculate the diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, treasury stock method has been applied to calculate the number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of shares relating to RSUs. The excluded number of anti-dilutive share-based awards was approximately 0.3 million, 0.3 million and 0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe dilutive impact related to the Company&#8217;s 0 % Notes and 1.625 % Notes has been calculated using the if-converted method for the year ended December 31, 2022 and using the treasury stock method for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. While the 0 % Notes are repayable in cash up to the par value and in cash or shares of common stock for their entire value, the 1.625 % Notes are repayable in cash or shares of common stock for their entire value. The dilutive impact for the 1.00 % Notes has been calculated using the treasury stock method until its maturity and repayment on December 1, 2020. \n\nPrior to conversion, the convertible note hedges are not considered for purposes of the earnings per share calculations, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the convertible note hedges are expected to offset the dilutive effect of the 0 % Notes and 1.625 % Notes when the stock price is above $ 52.97 and $ 20.72 per share, respectively. The dilutive impact of the \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nwarrants issued concurrently with the issuance of the 0 % Notes, 1.625 % Notes and 1.00 % Notes with exercise prices of $ 74.34 , $ 30.70 and $ 25.96 , respectively, has been included in the calculation of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding, if applicable. All of the warrants issued in connection with the 1.00 % Notes were settled during 2021. \n\nEquity \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nUnder the Company's share repurchase program announced on November 15, 2018 (the \"Share Repurchase Program\"), the Company could repurchase up to $ 1.5 billion (exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses) of the Company's common stock from December 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022. The repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program amounted to $ 259.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 65.3 million repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Share Repurchase Program, which did not require the Company to purchase any particular amount of common stock and was subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, expired on December 31, 2022, with approximately $ 1,036.0 million remaining unutilized. \n\nIn February 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the &#8220;2023 Share Repurchase Program&#8221;) under which the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $ 3.0 billion of the Company's common stock (exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses). Under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, which does not require the Company to purchase any minimum amount of common stock, the Company may repurchase shares from February 8, 2023 through December 31, 2025. \n\nActivity under the Share Repurchase Program is as follows (in millions, except per share data): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Number of repurchased shares (1) 4.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.6 &#160; Aggregate purchase price $ 259.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 65.3 &#160; Fees, commissions and other expenses &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.1 &#160; Total cash used for share repurchases $ 259.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 65.4 &#160; Weighted-average purchase price per share (2) $ 65.13 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18.08 &#160; Available under the Share Repurchase Program $ 1,036.0 &#160; (3) \n\n$ 1,295.8 &#160; $ 1,295.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) None of these shares had been reissued or retired as of December 31, 2022 but may be reissued or retired later. \n\n(2) Exclusive of fees, commission or other expenses \n\n(3) The Share Repurchase Program expired on December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 1,036 million remained unutilized under such program \n\nReissuance of shares held in treasury stock \n\nIn connection with the maturity of the 1.00 % Notes on December 1, 2020, the Company reissued shares of common stock held in treasury to settle the excess over the principal amount. This was the first time the Company reissued shares held in treasury stock and accounted for such reissuance on a first-in, first-out basis. Pursuant to the hedge transactions entered concurrently with the issuance of the 1.00 % Notes, the Company acquired an equivalent number of shares of its common stock at the prevailing fair market value, to effectively offset the reissuance from treasury stock. This repurchase did not reduce the authorized amount remaining under the Share Repurchase Program. \n\nShares for Restricted Stock Units Tax Withholding \n\nThe amounts remitted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 78.1 million, $ 38.9 million and $ 20.0 million, respectively, for which the Company withheld approximately 1.3 million, 0.9 million and 1.1 million shares of common stock, respectively, that were underlying the RSUs that vested.

The purchase price payable to FSL for the remaining 40 % equity, offset by the purchase price adjustment, resulted in the Company receiving $ 26.0 million in settlement of the purchase price from FSL during the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of OSA have been consolidated in the Company&#8217;s financial statements. \n\nStockholders' Rights Plan \n\nOn June 7, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a \"Right\") for each outstanding share of common stock to the stockholders of record on June 18, 2020.

Upon vesting of RSUs, stock grant awards or completion of a purchase under the ESPP, the Company issues new shares of common stock. \n\nShare-Based Compensation Information \n\nThe fair value per unit of each RSU and stock grant award is determined on the grant date. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The annualized pre-vesting forfeitures for RSUs were estimated to be approximately 8 % for the year ended December 31, 2022, 6 % for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 5 % for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\nPlan and Award Descriptions \n\nOn March 23, 2010, the Company adopted the Amended and Restated SIP which has been subsequently amended over the years primarily to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to all awards.

Compensation expense for RSUs with market conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value irrespective of the achievement of the condition. The fair value of the vested awards are based on the stock price as of the vesting dates, during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $ 232.8 million, $ 123.5 million and $ 62.4 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures related to non-vested RSUs granted under the Amended and Restated SIP with service, performance and market conditions, was $ 69.0 million, $ 11.2 million and $ 20.5 million, respectively. For RSUs with time-based service conditions, expense is being recognized over the vesting period; for RSUs with performance criteria, expense is recognized over the period when the performance criteria is expected to be achieved; for RSUs with market conditions, expense is recognized over the period in which the condition is assessed irrespective of whether it would be achieved or not. Unrecognized compensation cost for awards with certain performance criteria that are not expected to be achieved is not included here.

Such plans conform to local practice in terms of providing minimum benefits mandated by law, collective agreements or customary practice. The Company recognizes the aggregate amount of all overfunded plans as assets and the aggregate amount of all underfunded plans as liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is updated at least annually, taking into consideration its asset allocation, historical returns on similar types of assets and the current \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\neconomic environment. For estimation purposes, the Company assumes its long-term asset mix will generally be consistent with the current mix.

The Company has an investment mix with a wide diversification of asset types and fund strategies that are aligned with each region and foreign location's economy and market conditions. Investments in government securities are generally guaranteed by the respective government offering the securities. Investments in corporate bonds, equity securities, and foreign mutual funds are made with the expectation that these investments will give an adequate rate of long-term returns despite periods of high volatility. Other types of investments include investments in cash deposits, money market funds and insurance contracts. Asset allocations are based on the anticipated required funding amounts, timing of benefit payments, historical returns on similar assets and the influence of the current economic environment. \n\nThe following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, a summary of investments measured at fair value and the asset allocations of the plan assets in the Company's foreign pension plans (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 Allocation Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Asset Category Cash/Money Markets 2 &#160; % $ 3.0 &#160; $ 3.0 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Foreign Government/Treasury Securities (1) 10 &#160; % 13.4 &#160; 13.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate Bonds, Debentures (2) 26 &#160; % 33.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 33.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Equity Securities (3) 23 &#160; % 30.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 30.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mutual Funds 7 &#160; % 9.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Investment and Insurance Contracts (4) 32 &#160; % 42.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18.6 &#160; 23.8 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 131.7 &#160; $ 16.4 &#160; $ 91.5 &#160; $ 23.8 &#160; As of December 31, 2021 Allocation Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Asset Category Cash/Money Markets 2 &#160; % $ 3.6 &#160; $ 3.6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Foreign Government/Treasury Securities (1) 9 &#160; % 17.2 &#160; 17.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate Bonds, Debentures (2) 17 &#160; % 32.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 32.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Equity Securities (3) 27 &#160; % 52.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 52.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mutual Funds 6 &#160; % 10.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Investment and Insurance Contracts (4) 39 &#160; % 73.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22.6 &#160; 50.6 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 189.7 &#160; $ 20.8 &#160; $ 118.3 &#160; $ 50.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) Includes investments primarily in guaranteed return securities. \n\n(2) Includes investments in government bonds and corporate bonds of developed countries, emerging market government bonds, emerging market corporate bonds and convertible bonds. \n\n(3) Includes investments in equity securities of developed countries and emerging markets. \n\n(4) Includes certain investments with insurance companies that guarantee a minimum rate of return on the investment. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nWhen available, the Company uses observable market data, including pricing on recently closed market transactions and quoted prices, which are included in Level 2.

Eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their salary subject to certain limitations. The Company has elected to match 100 % of employee contributions between 0 % and 4 % of their salary, with an annual limit as mandated by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company recognized $ 14.7 million, $ 16.7 million and $ 19.4 million of expense relating to matching contributions in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain foreign subsidiaries have defined contribution plans in which eligible employees participate. The Company recognized compensation expense of $ 20.5 million, $ 27.2 million and $ 21.8 million relating to these plans for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nNote 13: Commitments and Contingencies \n\nPurchase Obligations \n\nThe Company has agreements with suppliers, external manufacturers and other vendors for capital expenditures, inventory purchases, manufacturing services, information technology and other goods and services. The following is a schedule by year of future minimum purchase obligations under non-cancelable arrangements entered into during the ordinary course of business as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 $ 1,255.9 &#160; 2024 375.0 &#160; 2025 62.6 &#160; 2026 39.4 &#160; 2027 28.2 &#160; Thereafter 0.1 &#160; Total \n\n$ 1,761.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nEnvironmental Contingencies \n\nThe Company&#8217;s current headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona are located on property that is a \"Superfund\" site, which is a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"). Motorola and Freescale (acquired by NXP Semiconductors N.V.) have been involved in the clean-up activities of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. The Company has sold its current headquarters location and is anticipating a move to a new headquarters location (in the greater Phoenix area) in the first quarter of 2023. The Company was previously indemnified with respect to certain remediation or other costs or liabilities connected to the location of the current headquarters, and, as part of the sale, all of the Company&#8217;s liabilities associated with the clean-up activities of the current headquarters site and any remediation were transferred to the buyer. Any costs to the Company in connection with this matter have not been material. \n\nThough the Company has encountered and dealt with a number of environmental issues over time relating to the various locations that comprise its operations, any costs to the Company in connection with such matters have not been, and, based on the information available, are not expected to be material. \n\nThe following presents a summary of such environmental contingencies: \n\n&#8226; East Greenwich, Rhode Island . The Company&#8217;s design center in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is located on property that has localized soil contamination. In connection with the purchase of the facility, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not to Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. \n\n&#8226; Santa Clara, California . As a result of the acquisition of AMIS in 2008, the Company is a \"primary responsible party\" to an environmental remediation and clean-up plan at AMIS&#8217;s former corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Costs incurred by AMIS include implementation of the clean-up plan, operations and maintenance of remediation systems, and other project management costs. However, AMIS&#8217;s former parent company, a subsidiary of Nippon Mining, contractually agreed to indemnify AMIS and the Company for any obligations relating to environmental remediation and clean-up activities at this location. This facility was divested to Lincoln Property Company Commercial, Inc. in 2022. \n\n&#8226; South Portland, Maine . Through its acquisition of Fairchild, the Company acquired a facility in South Portland, Maine. This facility was divested to Diodes, Inc. in 2022. This facility has ongoing environmental remediation projects to respond to certain releases of hazardous substances that occurred prior to the leveraged recapitalization of Fairchild from its former parent company, National Semiconductor Corporation, which is now owned by TI. To the extent the Company could still incur liabilities with respect to these remediation projects, pursuant to a 1997 asset purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Fairchild recapitalization, National Semiconductor Corporation agreed to indemnify Fairchild, without limitation and for an indefinite period of time, for all future costs related to these projects. \n\n&#8226; Bucheon, South Korea . Under a 1999 asset purchase agreement pursuant to which Fairchild purchased the power device business of Samsung, Samsung agreed to indemnify Fairchild in an amount up to $ 150.0 million for remediation costs and other liabilities related to historical contamination at Samsung&#8217;s Bucheon, South Korea operations. \n\n&#8226; Mountain Top, Pennsylvania . Under a 2001 asset purchase agreement pursuant to which Fairchild purchased a manufacturing facility in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania, Intersil Corp. (subsequently acquired by Renesas Electronics \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nCorporation) agreed to indemnify Fairchild for remediation costs and other liabilities related to historical contamination at the facility. \n\n&#8226; Hartford, Illinois . The Company was notified by the EPA that it has been identified as a PRP under CERCLA in the Chemetco Superfund matter. Chemetco, a defunct reclamation services supplier that operated in Hartford, Illinois at what is now a Superfund site, has performed reclamation services for the Company in the past. The EPA is pursuing Chemetco customers for contribution to the site clean-up activities. The Company has joined a PRP group, which is cooperating with the EPA in the evaluation and funding of the clean-up activities. \n\nFinancing Contingencies \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either the Company or its subsidiaries, as required for transactions, including, but not limited to, material purchase commitments, agreements to mitigate collection risk, leases, utilities or customs guarantees. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's Revolving Credit Facility included $ 15.0 million available for the issuance of letters of credit. There were $ 0.9 million letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022, which reduced the Company's borrowing capacity. The Company also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of its Revolving Credit Facility totaling $ 16.2 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nAs part of obtaining financing in the ordinary course of business, the Company issued guarantees related to certain of its subsidiaries, which totaled $ 0.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Based on historical experience and information currently available, the Company believes that it will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future. \n\nIndemnification Contingencies \n\nThe Company is a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, including acquisition agreements, pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. Some of the agreements entered into by the Company require it to indemnify the other party against losses due to IP infringement, property damage (including environmental contamination), personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, the Company&#8217;s negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets. In the case of certain acquisition agreements, these agreements may require us to maintain such indemnification provisions for the acquiree&#8217;s directors, officers and other employees and agents, in certain cases for a number of years following the acquisition. \n\nThe Company faces risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its products fail to perform as expected or such failure of its products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damage, bodily injury or property damage. In addition, if any of the Company&#8217;s designed products are alleged to be defective, the Company may be required to participate in their recall. Depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, the Company may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability company operating agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\") authorizes a court to award, or a corporation&#8217;s board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. The terms of Section 145 of the DGCL are sufficiently broad to permit indemnification under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement of expenses incurred, arising under the Exchange Act. As permitted by the DGCL, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") contains provisions relating to the limitation of liability and indemnification of directors and officers. The Certificate of Incorporation eliminates the personal liability of each of the Company&#8217;s directors to the fullest extent permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, as it may be amended or supplemented, and provides that the Company will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, as amended from time to time. \n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers. The form of agreement (the \"Indemnification Agreement\") provides, subject to certain exceptions and conditions specified in the Indemnification Agreement, that the Company will indemnify each indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with a proceeding or claim in which such person is involved because of his or her status as one of the Company&#8217;s directors or executive officers. In addition, the Indemnification Agreement provides that the Company will, to the extent not \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nprohibited by law and subject to certain exceptions and repayment conditions, advance specified indemnifiable expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connection with such proceeding or claim. \n\nThe Company also maintains directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; insurance policies that indemnify its directors and officers against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Exchange Act, which might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such. \n\nWhile the Company&#8217;s future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of the Company&#8217;s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, the Company does not believe that any amounts that it may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nGovernment Assistance \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received government assistance from U.S. federal and state governments and non-U.S. governments in the form of cash grants and tax abatements which in most cases, attached conditions for a specific duration period, generally related to hiring, training and/or retaining employees, the construction or acquisition of assets or to develop specific technologies. If conditions are not satisfied or the duration period for the agreement is infringed, the incentives are subject to reduction, termination, or recapture. \n\nThe Company's accounting policy is to recognize a benefit to the income statement over the duration of the program when the conditions, including the required spending, attached to the incentive are achieved and the Company is expected to complete any further requirements. A grant that compensates for operational expenses are recognized as a reduction from the nature of the expense the grant is designated to offset. A grant related to property, plant and equipment investments is recognized as a reduction to the cost-basis of the underlying assets with an ongoing reduction to depreciation expenses based on the useful lives of the related assets. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a nominal amount related to these programs. To the extent amounts have been received by the Company in advance of the completion of the conditions, they have been recorded as a liability. The duration of the agreements for the incentives received by the Company in 2022 ranges from one to five years , with a recapture period that can extend up to five years . \n\nLegal Matters \n\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including indemnification claims, claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other IP rights, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. The Company evaluates the status of the legal proceedings in which it is involved to assess whether a loss is reasonably estimable and either remote, reasonably possible or probable of occurring. The Company further evaluates each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss can be made for disclosure purposes. Although litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that it has adequate provisions for any probable and reasonably estimable losses. However, the Company&#8217;s estimates may not represent its maximum possible exposure in any particular legal proceeding. Legal expenses related to defense, negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of outside legal counsel are expensed as incurred. \n\nThe Company is currently involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on information currently available, except as disclosed below (if any), the Company is not involved in any pending or threatened legal proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The litigation process is inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot guarantee that the outcome of any litigation matter will be favorable to the Company. \n\nIntellectual Property Matters \n\nThe Company faces risk of exposure from claims of infringement of the IP rights of others. In the ordinary course of business, the Company receives letters asserting that the Company&#8217;s products or components breach another party&#8217;s rights.

Demand and time deposits and money market funds are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, while corporate bonds and commercial paper are classified as Level 2. The carrying amount of other current assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 Fair Value Level Description Amortized Cost Unrealized gains Unrealized losses Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents: Demand and time deposits $ 233.1 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 233.1 &#160; $ 233.1 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Money market funds 17.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17.0 &#160; 17.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other current assets: Corporate bonds $ 23.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 23.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 23.8 &#160; Certificate of deposit 3.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.1 &#160; Commercial paper 3.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.2 &#160; 1.2 &#160; 2.0 &#160; US Treasury bonds 2.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.1 &#160; Other assets: Corporate bonds $ 0.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 0.8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 0.8 &#160; Certificate of deposit &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; US Treasury bonds &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2021 Fair Value Level Description Amortized Cost Unrealized gains Unrealized losses Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents: Demand and time deposits $ 19.5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 19.5 &#160; $ 19.5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Money market funds 0.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.7 &#160; 0.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate bonds 1.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.6 &#160; Commercial paper 2.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.0 &#160; Other current assets: Corporate bonds $ 16.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 16.0 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 16.0 &#160; Certificate of deposit 1.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.9 &#160; Commercial paper 5.0 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5.0 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 2.0 &#160; US Treasury bonds 0.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.4 &#160; Other assets: Corporate bonds $ 19.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 19.7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 19.7 &#160; Certificate of deposit &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; US Treasury bonds 1.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFair Value of Long-Term Debt, including Current Portion \n\nThe carrying amounts and fair value of the Company&#8217;s long-term borrowings are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Long-term debt, including current portion (1) 0 % Notes \n\n$ 791.1 &#160; $ 1,057.8 &#160; $ 664.8 &#160; $ 1,183.1 &#160; 1.625 % Notes \n\n137.0 &#160; 417.8 &#160; 144.6 &#160; 513.6 &#160; Long-term debt 2,265.4 &#160; 2,167.5 &#160; 2,265.2 &#160; 2,245.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) Long-term debt is carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at historical cost net of debt discount and issuance costs. \n\nThe fair value of the 0 % Notes (as of December 31, 2021), 3.875 % Notes and 1.625 % Notes were estimated based on market prices in active markets (Level 1). The fair value of other long-term debt was estimated based on discounting the remaining principal and interest payments using current market rates for similar debt (Level 2) at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n\nFair Values Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis \n\nThe Company's non-financial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at fair value upon a business combination and are remeasured at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. The Company uses unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that are significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations require management's judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. The Company determines the fair value of its held and used assets, goodwill and intangible assets using an income, cost or market approach as determined reasonable. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no non-financial assets included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The following table shows the \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nadjustments to fair value of certain of the Company's non-financial assets that had an impact on the Company's results of operations (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Nonrecurring fair value measurements Goodwill impairments (Level 3) $ 330.0 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Intangibles impairment (Level 3) 56.8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Asset impairments (Level 3) 14.8 &#160; 7.9 &#160; 17.5 &#160; IPRD impairments (Level 3) &#8212; &#160; 2.9 &#160; 1.3 &#160; $ 401.6 &#160; $ 10.8 &#160; $ 18.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNote 15: Financial Instruments \n\nForeign Currencies \n\nAs a multinational business, the Company's transactions are denominated in a variety of currencies. When appropriate, the Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on its results of operations and cash flows. The Company's policy prohibits trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures and entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure. The Company primarily hedges existing assets and liabilities associated with transactions currently on its balance sheet, which are undesignated hedges for accounting purposes. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts of $ 272.0 million and $ 288.3 million, respectively. Such contracts were obtained through financial institutions and were scheduled to mature within one to three months from the time of purchase. Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the Company to increased risks from foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions to which they are related. \n\nThe following schedule summarizes the Company's net foreign exchange positions in U.S. dollars (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 Buy (Sell) Notional Amount Buy (Sell) Notional Amount Philippine Peso 63.9 &#160; 63.9 &#160; 67.1 &#160; 67.1 &#160; Euro 26.0 &#160; 26.0 &#160; 65.9 &#160; 65.9 &#160; Korean Won 35.7 &#160; 35.7 &#160; 44.1 &#160; 44.1 &#160; Japanese Yen 27.0 &#160; 27.0 &#160; 33.2 &#160; 33.2 &#160; Czech Koruna 41.7 &#160; 41.7 &#160; 15.0 &#160; 15.0 &#160; Other currencies - Buy 66.5 &#160; 66.5 &#160; 58.7 &#160; 58.7 &#160; Other currencies - Sell ( 11.2 ) 11.2 &#160; ( 4.3 ) 4.3 &#160; $ 249.6 &#160; 272.0 &#160; $ 279.7 &#160; $ 288.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAmounts receivable or payable under the contracts were not material as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 and are included in other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions totaled a loss of $ 0.7 million, $ 0.8 million and $ 6.2 million, respectively. The realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense) in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nInterest rate risk \n\nThe Company uses interest rate swap contracts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2022, \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nthe Company had interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $ 750.0 million, $ 500.0 million and $ 500.0 million for fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swaps totaled $ 36.0 million as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately $ 22.0 million was included in other current assets and approximately $ 14.0 million was included in other non-current assets. The fair value of interest rate swaps totaled $ 5.7 million as of December 31, 2021, which was included in other non-current assets. The Company did not identify any ineffectiveness with respect to the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. These derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and classified based on each instrument&#8217;s maturity dates. \n\nOther than the interest rate swap contracts, the Company did not have any other outstanding derivatives related to cash flow hedges. \n\nSee Note 17: ''Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss'' for the effective amounts related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges affecting accumulated other comprehensive loss and the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nConvertible Note Hedges \n\nThe Company entered into convertible note hedges in connection with the issuance of the 0 % Notes and 1.625 % Notes. \n\nSee Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' for additional information. \n\nOther \n\nOther than as described above, at December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options relating to either its debt instruments or investments. The Company does not hedge the value of its equity investments in its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses if its hedge counterparties fail to perform their obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the counterparties to the Company's hedge contracts are held at financial institutions which the Company believes to be highly rated, and no credit related losses are anticipated. \n\nNote 16: Income Taxes \n\nThe Company's geographic sources of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 1,979.8 &#160; $ 873.2 &#160; $ ( 181.2 ) Foreign 382.4 &#160; 284.6 &#160; 357.8 &#160; Income before income taxes $ 2,362.2 &#160; $ 1,157.8 &#160; $ 176.6 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nThe Company's provision (benefit) for income taxes is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ 331.9 &#160; $ 8.0 &#160; $ 0.6 &#160; State and local 31.8 &#160; 4.8 &#160; 0.1 &#160; Foreign 73.8 &#160; 43.3 &#160; 54.0 &#160; 437.5 &#160; 56.1 &#160; 54.7 &#160; Deferred: Federal ( 36.9 ) 89.2 &#160; ( 69.2 ) State and local 25.7 &#160; 7.8 &#160; ( 66.4 ) Foreign 32.1 &#160; ( 6.5 ) 21.1 &#160; 20.9 &#160; 90.5 &#160; ( 114.5 ) Total provision (benefit) $ 458.4 &#160; $ 146.6 &#160; $ ( 59.8 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 U.S. federal statutory rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % Increase (decrease) resulting from: State and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.7 &#160; 1.4 &#160; ( 1.4 ) Impact of foreign operations 1.7 &#160; ( 2.0 ) 7.6 &#160; Foreign derived intangible income benefit ( 7.4 ) ( 7.8 ) &#8212; &#160; Nondeductible goodwill 3.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Impact of the Domestication (1) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 35.7 ) Change in valuation allowance and related effects (2) ( 0.1 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 24.4 ) Share-based compensation costs ( 0.5 ) ( 0.1 ) 1.7 &#160; U.S. federal R&#38;D credit ( 0.2 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 3.6 ) Non-deductible officer compensation 0.3 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 1.1 &#160; Other (3) ( 0.2 ) 0.6 &#160; ( 0.1 ) Total 19.4 &#160; % 12.7 &#160; % ( 33.8 ) % ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________________ \n\n(1) On July 6, 2020, the Company completed a simplification of its corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of its non-U.S. IP to the United States via domestication of certain foreign subsidiaries (the \"Domestication\"). The Domestication more closely aligns the Company's corporate structure with its operating structure in accordance with the OECD&#8217;s BEPS conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a benefit primarily from recognizing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $ 63.0 million, or 35.7 %. \n\n(2) For the year ended December 31, 2022, this included a benefit of $ 55.6 million, or 2.4 % related to a decrease in the valuation allowance for the expiration of Japan net operating losses (\"NOLs\"), partially netted with an offsetting expense of $ 54.3 million, or 2.3 % related to the expiration of those same Japan NOLs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this included a benefit of $ 26.3 million, or 2.2 % related to a decrease in the valuation allowance for the expiration of Japan NOLs, partially netted with an offsetting expense of $ 22.6 million, or 1.9 % related to the expiration of those same Japan NOLs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this included a benefit of $ 49.4 million, or 28.0 %, for the release of a partial state valuation allowance due to an increase to forecasted domestic income as a result of the Domestication of certain foreign subsidiaries and an expense of $ 61.8 million, or 35.0 %, primarily related to the expiration of Japan NOLs, netted with the offsetting benefit of $ 61.8 million, or 35.0 %, primarily for the decrease in the related valuation allowance for those same Japan NOLs. \n\n(3) For the year ended December 31, 2021, this included an expense of $ 8.5 million, or 0.7 %, related to an election to waive Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (\"BEAT\") deductions for all U.S. federal tax purposes for the 2021 tax year. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.4 %, which differs from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit received from Section 250 deduction related to FDII, partially offset by the impact of nondeductible goodwill. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2021 was 12.7 %, which differs from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit received from Section 250 deduction related to FDII. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2020 was a benefit of ( 33.8 )%, which differs from the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the Domestication of certain foreign subsidiaries and a partial release of state valuation allowance, partially offset by foreign taxes for which the Company will not receive a U.S. tax credit as well as period costs related to the Company's global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") inclusion. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes that give rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax asset (liability) are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 2021 NOL and tax credit carryforwards $ 221.6 &#160; $ 354.4 &#160; 163 (j) interest expense carryforward 5.1 &#160; 17.4 &#160; Lease liabilities 65.0 &#160; 50.2 &#160; ROU asset ( 60.9 ) ( 49.2 ) Tax-deductible goodwill and amortizable intangibles ( 35.9 ) ( 57.5 ) Capitalization of research and development expenses 311.4 &#160; 185.8 &#160; Reserves and accruals 79.1 &#160; 109.2 &#160; Property, plant and equipment ( 156.3 ) ( 110.6 ) Inventories 78.3 &#160; 67.9 &#160; Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 64.2 ) ( 58.7 ) Share-based compensation 7.5 &#160; 7.9 &#160; Pension 7.5 &#160; 15.3 &#160; Other 36.8 &#160; 18.4 &#160; Deferred tax assets and liabilities before valuation allowance 495.0 &#160; 550.5 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 152.4 ) ( 227.4 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 342.6 &#160; $ 323.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have investment tax credits, which are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740, in Korea and the Czech Republic.

The decrease is due to current year utilization. These NOL carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely until utilized. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 2.1 million and $ 43.6 million, respectively, of U.S. federal credit carryforwards, before the impact of unrecognized tax benefits. The decrease is primarily due to current year utilization. The credits will expire in 2031 if unutilized. These NOL and credit carryforwards relate to acquisitions and, consequently, are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 324.6 million and $ 491.1 million, respectively, of U.S. state NOL carryforwards, before consideration of valuation allowance or the impact of unrecognized tax benefits. The decrease is due to current year utilization. The U.S. state NOL carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from 2023 to 2040, if unutilized. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 123.5 million and $ 138.4 million, respectively, of U.S. state credit carryforwards before consideration of valuation allowance or the impact of unrecognized tax benefits. The U.S. state credits will expire in varying amounts beginning in 2023 while a substantial amount of the state credits carryforward indefinitely. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 268.3 million and $ 551.8 million, respectively, of foreign NOL carryforwards, before consideration of valuation allowance. The decrease is primarily due to the expiration of Japan NOLs. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 65.7 million and $ 69.2 million, respectively, of foreign credit carryforwards before consideration of valuation allowance or the impact of unrecognized tax benefits. A significant portion of the foreign NOLs and credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from 2023 to 2025, if unutilized. \n\nThe Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $ 24.1 million on a portion of its Japan NOLs, which expire at various dates through 2032. In addition to the valuation allowance on the Japan NOLs, the Company also maintains a partial valuation allowance of $ 71.1 million on its U.S. state deferred tax assets, primarily NOLs and credits. The remaining valuation allowance primarily relates to NOLs and tax credits in certain other foreign jurisdictions that primarily expire in 2025. \n\nON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company was not indefinitely reinvested with respect to the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and has therefore accrued withholding taxes that would be owed upon future distributions of such earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe activity for unrecognized gross tax benefits is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 137.2 &#160; $ 151.0 &#160; $ 130.0 &#160; Acquired balances &#8212; &#160; 9.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Additions for tax benefits related to the current year 3.3 &#160; 3.1 &#160; 11.9 &#160; Additions for tax benefits of prior years 0.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 12.3 &#160; Reductions for tax benefits of prior years ( 0.3 ) ( 19.7 ) ( 1.4 ) Lapse of statute ( 3.8 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 1.3 ) Settlements ( 0.1 ) ( 3.8 ) ( 0.5 ) Balance at end of year $ 136.8 &#160; $ 137.2 &#160; $ 151.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncluded in the December 31, 2022 balance of $ 136.8 million is $ 90.4 million related to unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. Also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 is $ 46.4 million of benefit that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to other tax accounts, primarily deferred taxes. Although the Company cannot predict the timing of resolution with taxing authorities, if any, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by $ 68.3 million in the next 12 months due to settlement with tax authorities or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued in relation to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized approximately $ 1.4 million tax expense and $ 3.3 million of net tax benefit and $ 0.2 million of tax expense for interest and penalties during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
