BUSINESS \n\nTeleflex Incorporated is referred to herein as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Teleflex&#8221; and the &#8220;Company.&#8221; \n\nTHE COMPANY \n\nTeleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits, improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply single-use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. We market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. Our major manufacturing operations are located in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States (the \"U.S.\"). \n\nWe are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through: \n\n&#8226; development of new products and product line extensions; \n\n&#8226; investment in new technologies and broadening the application of our existing technologies; \n\n&#8226; expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets; \n\n&#8226; achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by utilizing our direct sales force and distribution network to sell new products, as well as by increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing organizations, research and development activities and manufacturing and distribution facilities; and \n\n&#8226; expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions, licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance, expand or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share. \n\nOur research and development capabilities, commitment to engineering excellence and focus on low-cost manufacturing enable us to bring to market cost effective, innovative products that improve the safety, efficacy and quality of healthcare. Our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications, as well as developing enhancements to, and product line extensions of, existing products. During 2022 we introduced several product line extensions and six new products. Our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of Class I and Class II medical devices, most of which require 510(k) clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for sale in the U.S., and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510(k) clearance. We believe that seeking 510(k) clearance or qualifying for 510(k)-exempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks, and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval, or PMA, process that would be required for Class III medical devices. See \"Government Regulation\" below for additional information. \n\nHISTORY AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS \n\nTeleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical push/pull controls for military aircraft. From this original single market, single product orientation, we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses, development of new products, introduction of products into new geographic or end-markets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses. Throughout our history, we have continually focused on providing innovative, technology-driven, specialty-engineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements. \n\nBeginning in 2007, we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses, expanding our presence in the medical device industry, while divesting all of our other businesses, which served the aerospace, automotive, industrial and marine markets. Following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011, we became exclusively a medical device company. \n\nIn 2017, we completed two large scale acquisitions: NeoTract, Inc. (\"NeoTract\") and Vascular Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;Vascular Solutions&#8221;). NeoTract was a medical device company that developed and commercialized the UroLift System, a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. Vascular Solutions was a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures. \n\nIn 2021, we divested certain product lines within our global respiratory product portfolio to Medline Industries, Inc. (&#8220;Medline&#8221;) (the \"Respiratory business divestiture\"). We completed the initial phase of the Respiratory business divestiture on June 28, 2021. The second and final phase of the Respiratory business divestiture will occur once we transfer certain additional manufacturing assets to Medline and is expected to occur prior to the end of 2023. \n\nSee \"Our Products\" below and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nWe expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. In addition, we may identify further opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that no longer meet our objectives. \n\nRestructuring programs \n\nWe continue to execute our footprint realignment and other restructuring programs designed to improve efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution facilities and, to a lesser extent, our sales and marketing and research and development organizations. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nOUR SEGMENTS \n\nWe have four segments: Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), Asia (Asia Pacific) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer and Development Services). \n\nEach of our three geographic segments provides a comprehensive portfolio of medical technology products used by hospitals and healthcare providers. However, certain of our products are more heavily concentrated within certain segments. For example, most of our urology products are sold by our EMEA segment and most of our interventional urology products are sold by our Americas segment. Our product portfolio is described in the products section below. \n\nOur OEM segment designs, manufactures and supplies devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers. Our OEM division, which includes the TFX Medical OEM, TFX OEM, Deknatel and HPC Medical brands, provides custom extrusions, micro-diameter film-cast tubing, diagnostic and interventional catheters, balloons and balloon catheters, film-insulated fine wire, coated mandrel wire, conductors, sheath/dilator introducers, specialized sutures and performance fibers, bioabsorbable sutures, yarns and resins. \n\nThe following charts depict our net revenues by reportable operating segment as a percentage of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\nOUR PRODUCTS \n\nOur product categories within our geographic segments include vascular access, anesthesia, interventional, surgical, interventional urology, respiratory and urology. Each of these categories and the key products sold therein are described in more detail below. \n\nVascular Access: Our Vascular Access product category offers devices that facilitate a variety of critical care therapies and other applications with a focus on helping reduce vascular-related complications. These products primarily consist of our Arrow branded catheters, catheter navigation and tip positioning systems and our intraosseous, or in the bone, access systems. \n\nOur catheters are used in a wide range of procedures, including the administration of intravenous therapies, the measurement of blood pressure and the withdrawal of blood samples through a single puncture site. Many of our catheters provide antimicrobial and antithrombogenic protection technology that have been shown to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infections and microbial colonization and thrombus accumulation on catheter surfaces. \n\nOur intraosseous access systems are designed for the delivery of medications and fluids when intravenous access is difficult to obtain in emergent, urgent or medically necessary cases. Our products offer a method for vascular access that can be administered quickly and effectively in the hospital and pre-hospital environments and include the EZ-IO Intraosseous Vascular Access System and Arrow FAST1 Sternal Intraosseous Infusion System. \n\nInterventional: Our Interventional product category offers devices that facilitate a variety of applications to diagnose and deliver treatment via the vascular system of the body. These products primarily consist of a variety of coronary catheters, structural heart support devices, peripheral intervention products and mechanical circulatory support platform used by interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. Clinical benefits of our products include increased vein and artery access, post-procedure closure, and increased support during complex medical procedures. Our primary product offerings consist of a portfolio of Arrow branded intra-aortic balloon pumps and catheters, GuideLiner, Turnpike and TrapLiner catheters, the MANTA Vascular Closure device and Arrow OnControl powered bone biopsy system. \n\nAnesthesia: Our Anesthesia product category is comprised of airway, pain management and hemostatic product lines that support hospital, emergency medicine and military channels. \n\nOur airway management products and related devices are designed to enable use of standard and advanced anesthesia techniques in both pre-hospital emergency and hospital settings. Our key products include laryngoscopes, supraglottic airways, endotracheal tubes and atomization devices, which are branded under our LMA, Rusch and MAD trade names. \n\nOur pain management product line includes epidurals, catheters and disposable pain pumps for regional anesthesia, designed to improve patients&#8217; post-operative pain experience, which are branded under our Arrow trade name. \n\nOur hemostatic products accelerate the body's natural clotting cascade and are used in trauma situations where bleeding is difficult to control. The portfolio consists of external hemostats used by first responders, interventional products used in the catheter lab, and trauma products used by trauma surgeons, which are branded under our QuikClot trade name. \n\nSurgical: Our Surgical product category consists of single-use and reusable products designed to provide surgeons with devices for use in a variety of surgical procedures. These products primarily consist of metal and polymer ligation clips, fascial closure surgical systems used in laparoscopic surgical procedures, percutaneous surgical systems and other surgical instruments. Our significant surgical brands include Weck, MiniLap, Pleur-Evac, Deknatel, KMedic and Pilling. In 2022, we expanded our product portfolio with the acquisition of Standard Bariatrics, Inc. (&#8220;Standard Bariatrics&#8221;) and the Titan SGS brand, a powered stapling technology for bariatric surgery. \n\nInterventional Urology: Our interventional urology product category includes the UroLift System, a minimally invasive technology for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. The UroLift System involves the placement of permanent implants, typically through a transurethral outpatient procedure, that hold the prostate lobes apart to relieve compression on the urethra without cutting, heating or removing prostate tissue. Our Interventional Urology product portfolio is most heavily weighted in our Americas segment. \n\nRespiratory: Our respiratory products are used in a variety of care settings and primarily consist of humidification and oxygen therapy products. The Respiratory business divestiture included products marketed under the Hudson RCI brand name that comprised oxygen therapy products, aerosol therapy products, spirometry products and ventilation management products. \n\nUrology: Our urology product portfolio provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and individuals in the home care markets. The product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters (including Foley and intermittent), urine collectors, catheterization accessories and products for operative endourology, which are marketed under the Teleflex and Rusch brand names. Our urology product portfolio is most heavily weighted in our EMEA segment. \n\nOUR MARKETS \n\nWe generally serve three end-markets: hospitals and healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers and home care. These markets are affected by a number of factors, including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns. The following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 derived from each of our end markets: \n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION \n\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products. \n\nRegulation of Medical Devices in the U.S. \n\nAll of our medical devices manufactured or distributed in the U.S. are subject to requirements set forth by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) and regulations promulgated by the FDA under the FDC Act, which are enforced by the FDA. The FDA and, in some cases, other government agencies administer requirements for the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, servicing, marketing, importing and exporting of all finished devices intended for human use. Additional FDA requirements include premarket clearance and approval, advertising and promotion, distribution and post-market surveillance of our medical devices and establishment of registration and device listing for our facilities. \n\nUnless an exemption, pre-amendment grandfather status (that is, medical devices legally marketed in the U.S. before May 28, 1976) or FDA enforcement discretion applies, each medical device that we market in the U.S. must first receive either clearance as a Class I or, typically, a Class II device (after submitting a premarket notification (&#8220;510(k)&#8221;) or approval as a Class III device (after filing a premarket approval application (&#8220;PMA&#8221;)) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must demonstrate to the FDA that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device (a 510(k)-cleared device, a pre-amendment device for which FDA has not called for PMAs or a device with a de novo authorization), referred to as the \"predicate device.\" Substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device. The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months, but it can last longer. A device that is not eligible for the 510(k) process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed by the FDA through the de novo process (the process for granting marketing authorization when no substantially equivalent device exists) if the FDA agrees it is a low to moderate risk device. A device that is not exempt from premarket review and is not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo authorization is categorized as Class III and must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of \n\nthe safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. The process of obtaining PMA approval also requires specific regulatory competence and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) or de novo processes. The PMA process generally takes from one to three years or even longer. Our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of Class I (510(k) exempt) and Class II devices that require 510(k) clearance, although a few are 510(k)-exempt. In addition, certain modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA or PMA supplement. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market. \n\nA clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance or a de novo authorization. The sponsor of a clinical trial must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations, including FDA&#8217;s requirements for investigational device exemptions (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) requirements and good clinical practice (&#8220;GCP&#8221;). Clinical trials must also be approved, and are subject to continuing oversight, by an institutional review board (\"IRB\"), which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications to, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human research subjects. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent hold or discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical trial to be halted at a given clinical trial site for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or to adequately ensure the protection of human subjects, or may impose other conditions. Conducting medical device clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning, conducting and/or monitoring the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer. \n\nA device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements. Those regulatory requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; device listing and establishment registration; \n\n&#8226; adherence to the Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;), which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures; \n\n&#8226; labeling, including advertising and promotion, requirements; \n\n&#8226; prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications; \n\n&#8226; adverse event and malfunction reporting (Medical Device Reports or \"MDRs\"); \n\n&#8226; post-approval restrictions or conditions, potentially including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing; \n\n&#8226; post-market surveillance requirements; \n\n&#8226; the FDA&#8217;s recall authority, whereby it can require or request the recall of products from the market; and \n\n&#8226; reporting and documentation of voluntary corrections or removals. \n\nThe FDA has issued final regulations regarding the Unique Device Identification (&#8220;UDI&#8221;) System, which requires manufacturers to label or mark certain medical devices and/or their packaging with unique identifiers. Although the FDA expects that the UDI System will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety, it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling. The UDI System was implemented in stages based on device risk, with the first requirements having taken effect in September 2014 and the last in December 2022. \n\nCertain of our medical devices are sold in kits that include a drug component, such as lidocaine. These types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (\"CDRH\") under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit. Although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device, it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMPs&#8221;) and adverse drug experience reporting requirements, to the extent applicable to the drug-component repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cGMPs as well as other regulatory requirements. \n\nOur manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for-cause inspections by FDA personnel to verify compliance with the QSR (21 CFR Part 820) as well as other regulatory requirements. Similar inspections and audits are performed by Notified Bodies to verify compliance to applicable \n\nISO standards (e.g. ISO 13485:2016), by auditing organizations under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (\"MDSAP\") applicable to regulatory requirements of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the U.S., and/or by regulatory authorities to verify compliance with medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, civil penalties, consent decrees, injunctions, criminal prosecution, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal to permit importation or exportation, refusal to grant, or delays in granting, clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals. The FDA also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. \n\nRegulation of Medical Devices Outside of the U.S. \n\nMedical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the U.S. in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device-related adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems. Manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the MDSAP program or other regulatory authority inspections also apply. In addition, the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the &#8220;EU MDR&#8221;), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices (as compared to the predecessor Medical Device Directive (the \"EU MDD\")), including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, economic operators and post-market surveillance. The EU MDR went into effect in May 2021. As of the effective date, new and modified devices must be certified under, and be compliant with, the EU MDR. Devices that previously satisfied EU MDD requirements can continue to be marketed in the EU, subject to certain limitations, until the expiration of their current EU MDD certifications, which may be no later than May 2024, but certain EU MDR requirements went into effect for such devices in May 2021. In February 2023, the European Parliament and Council approved an amendment to extend the EU MDR certification deadline for currently marketed devices past May 2024, with December 2027 as the new deadline for highest-risk devices and December 2028 for lower-risk devices. Failure to obtain EU MDR certifications prior to the expiration of existing EU MDD certifications may limit our ability to sell certain products in the EU until EU MDR certification is obtained. Failure to meet the applicable EU MDR requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. \n\nHealthcare Laws \n\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws in the U.S. targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws prohibit us from, among other things, soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs. Violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the U.S. that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally or state funded programs. Certain marketing practices, such as off-label promotion, and violations of federal anti-kickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws. \n\nIn addition, we are subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry. Rules issued by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is available to the public on the CMS website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. In addition, several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. The federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations. \n\nFurther, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;), imposed regulatory mandates and other measures designed to contain the cost of healthcare, in addition to annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. Violations of these laws are punishable by a range of fines, penalties and other sanctions. \n\nOther Regulatory Requirements \n\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the U.S. that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the U.S., we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) and the Department of Commerce&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (&#8220;BIS&#8221;) which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the U.S. government. Despite our global trade and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, distributors or other agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment. \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete with many companies, ranging from small start-up enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources. Furthermore, extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete. We must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit, product reliability, performance, customer and sales support, and cost-effectiveness. \n\nSALES AND MARKETING \n\nOur product sales are made directly to hospitals, healthcare providers, distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces, independent representatives and independent distributor networks. \n\nBACKLOG \n\nMost of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks, with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers. Therefore, our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12-month period. \n\nPATENTS AND TRADEMARKS \n\nWe own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks. We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks. All product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries. Although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex name and the Arrow and UroLift brands, to be essential to the operation of our business. \n\nSUPPLIERS AND MATERIALS \n\nMaterials used in the manufacture and sterilization of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used, the components supplied and the sterilization services provided for our overall operations. Most \n\nof the materials, components and sterilization services we utilize are available from multiple sources, and where practical, we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. However, our ability to establish alternate sources of supply of materials and sterilization services may be delayed due to FDA and other regulatory authority requirements regarding the manufacture and sterilization of our products. Volatility in commodity prices, and freight costs, can have a significant impact on the cost of producing and supplying certain of our products. \n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nWe are engaged in both internal and external research and development. Our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide innovative new, safe and effective products that enhance clinical value by reducing infections, improving patient and clinician safety, enhancing patient outcomes and enabling less invasive procedures. \n\nWe also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers. \n\nSEASONALITY \n\nPortions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns and, to a lesser extent, the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to single-use products. Historically, we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors. \n\nHUMAN CAPITAL \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 15,500 employees, including 4,000 employees in the U.S. and 11,500 employees in 32 other countries around the world. Our global supply chain employees make up 58% of the total employee population and are located primarily in Mexico, Malaysia and the Czech Republic. Our commercial organization comprises 24% of the global employee base. The remaining 18% of employees work in various corporate functions, based in each of our locations. \n\nWe believe our employees are a significant differentiating factor and play a critical role in our ability to deliver on our commitments to patients and execute our strategy to our customers and shareholders. Our management team places significant focus and attention to matters affecting our people, particularly our commitment to our Core Values, capability development, total rewards and diversity, as well as how each employee experiences our culture. \n\nCulture \n\nThe culture of our organization is critical to the human capital we attract, develop and retain and who, in turn, contribute to the results and success of our organization. Our culture is framed by our Core Values &#8211; building trust, entrepreneurial spirit and making our workplace fun, with people at the center of all we do. We strive to develop and sustain our culture by embedding these values in all aspects of our organization, including our human capital strategies. \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion \n\nAt Teleflex, our Core Values define our company, shape our culture, guide our business practices, and direct the way we interact with our stakeholders. Rooted in our Core Values, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plays an essential role in fulfilling our company core purpose to improve the health and quality of peoples&#8217; lives. Through embedding the principles of DEI into our activities, decisions, governance, innovations, and culture, we contribute to the achievement of accessible, equitable and sustainable healthcare for all. \n\nDEI initiatives in Teleflex are supported by our Global DEI Council, composed of senior leadership from across the organization, and our four Regional DEI Councils in each the US &#38; Canada, LATAM, EMEA, and APAC. The Regional DEI Councils are representative of employees from all levels, functions, and regions, acting as a guiding hub of perspectives and experiences to enrich the importance of DEI in Teleflex. \n\nWithin our Regional DEI Councils, each of our Employee Resources Groups (ERGs) are represented by a member of their leadership committee to share the progress, knowledge, and initiatives from their respective ERG. Our ERG footprint extends to each of our four regions, providing our people with employee-driven communities that focus on initiatives such as supporting working parents &#38; caregivers, coordinating mentorship and development opportunities, promoting cultural awareness and understanding, and connecting employees with shared experiences, interests or backgrounds. \n\nWe continue our efforts to cultivate a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we work and serve. These efforts are supported through engaging and partnering with local organizations, educational institutions and recruiting firms for a variety of opportunities in Teleflex including vacancies, co-op placements and internships. In partnering with local organizations, we are better able to address how we can best serve and support marginalized populations in our communities. \n\nWe collect and regularly review several measures of the diversity within our global workforce. Some illustrative and notable highlights of our new hires from the January to December 2022 period are as follows: \n\n&#8226; At 58%, females made up the majority of our new hires globally; \n\n&#8226; Of the 5,654 total global hires, 51% were aged 20-29, followed by 24% aged 30-39 and 12% aged 40-49; and \n\n&#8226; In the US, approximately 50% of our new hires represented minority ethnicities including Black (23%), Asian (13%), and Hispanic (10%) \n\nTalent Management, Development and Learning \n\nWe are committed to providing our employees with opportunities for growth, development, and career advancement and to building a high-performance culture that supports our Core Values throughout the employee lifecycle. We have implemented a talent management process that provides regular coaching check-ins between employees and their managers to review the employee&#8217;s developmental objectives and career progression. We also regularly review our talent portfolio and succession plans to ensure we can deliver on our company strategy. \n\nIn addition, we offer a number of internal educational and training resources to employees throughout our organization. Among these resources is the Teleflex Academy, a curriculum that provides learning opportunities for our employees to further develop their skills and receive training across broad subject areas such as leadership; communications; diversity, equity, and inclusion; sales; customer service; and business acumen. \n\nTotal Rewards \n\nOur commitment to our employees is to provide fair, equitable and competitive compensation and benefits packages to all employees globally, regardless of gender, age or ethnicity. To that end we continuously review and calibrate employee roles and responsibilities to ensure we are offering equal pay for equal work, and we actively manage our global compensation and benefit programs to ensure we can attract and retain the critical human capital we need to continue to deliver on our commitments to employees, customers, patients and shareholders. We believe our compensation and benefits offering is aligned to competitive market pay levels and, along with our culture and Core Values, acts to incentivize the right behaviors and actions to achieve the best results for the organization. We structure our compensation to include a mix of pay components of base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term incentives. We offer employees health, welfare and retirement benefits and have implemented policies addressing paid time off, flexible work schedules, employee assistance, parental leave and family benefits, among others. \n\nIn 2021, we performed an in-depth pay equity analysis on the pay practices within our organization. As part of that analysis on our compensation programs, no systemic gender bias was identified globally and within the United States, no systemic ethnicity bias was identified. We continue to explore where we can expand our pay equity analyses for every jurisdiction in which we operate. We are committed to conducting pay equity analyses on a regular, periodic basis to ensure we continue to align to our commitments and Core Values. \n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety \n\nOur Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) vision is to protect the safety and health of Teleflex personnel and the environments in which we operate. We have a vested interest in protecting our most valuable assets &#8211; our employees. Everyone is a steward of EHS, fostering a culture of being actively responsible in all our operations. We remain fully committed to complying with all relevant EHS legislation and to achieving our vision. We have and will continue to expend resources to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities across the globe for environmental, health, safety and sustainability of our operations. For example, in response to the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have expended resources to implement various safety measures, including implementing social distancing protocols and expanding personal protective equipment availability and usage, across our facilities globally in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and others. Further, we understand that our environment is both complex and delicate, and we prioritize managing and limiting the impact our business has on the environment as part of our Zero Harm Culture. As we continue to review our commitments to environmental sustainability, we have initiated programs to track and lower our consumption of energy, water and gas as well as reduce waste and the use of hazardous materials. In addition, we have developed an EHS program \n\nfocused in the areas of training our personnel with respect to, deploying and auditing global EHS standards as well as other programs to engage our employees on EHS initiatives. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL \n\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. While we continue to devote resources to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those related to climate change, will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. \n\nINVESTOR INFORMATION \n\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;).

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or stock price. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. \n\nRisks Relating to our Business and Operations \n\nWe face strong competition. Our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business. \n\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive. We compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. \n\nIn addition, the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products. Our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop \n\nnew products, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products, due to, among other things, our inability to: \n\n&#8226; identify viable new products; \n\n&#8226; maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions; \n\n&#8226; obtain adequate intellectual property protection; \n\n&#8226; gain market acceptance of new products; or \n\n&#8226; successfully obtain regulatory approvals. \n\nIn addition, our competitors currently may be developing, or may develop in the future, products that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop. Our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements, and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us. \n\nThe ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business. Demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients&#8217; medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors. Internationally, healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly. In some countries, medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets, regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment. Other countries require application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage determinations by, and the financial support of, government and third party insurers, the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected. In this regard, we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products. Adverse coverage determinations, including reductions in the amount of reimbursement, could harm our business by discouraging customers&#8217; selection of, and reducing the prices they are willing to pay for, our products. \n\nIn addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third party payors have implemented and are continuing to implement cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures. These trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance. Our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOur products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and by comparable government agencies in other countries. The regulations govern, among other things, the development, design, clinical testing, premarket clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. Moreover, these regulations are subject to future change. \n\nIn the U.S., before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive either 510(k) clearance or de novo authorization or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, from the FDA. Similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. also require clearance, approval, authorization or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. In the EU, the EU MDR went into effect in May 2021 and includes significant additional pre- and post-market requirements. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign government authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, once a device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed. Furthermore, the FDA or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous, which could require us to generate \n\nadditional clinical or other data, and expend more time and effort, in obtaining future product clearances or approvals. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed realization of product revenues, substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance, such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application, or the FDA or a foreign government authority may change the classification of a product, which could require additional clinical studies and new marketing submissions. \n\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business, which could include: \n\n&#8226; partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing; \n\n&#8226; product shortages; \n\n&#8226; delays in product manufacturing; \n\n&#8226; warning or untitled letters; \n\n&#8226; fines or civil penalties; \n\n&#8226; delays in or restrictions on obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals; \n\n&#8226; withdrawal or suspension of required clearances, approvals or licenses; \n\n&#8226; product seizures or recalls; \n\n&#8226; injunctions; \n\n&#8226; criminal prosecution; \n\n&#8226; advisories or other field actions; \n\n&#8226; operating restrictions; and \n\n&#8226; prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the U.S. \n\nWe could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines. In addition, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion under Medicaid or Medicare, could result from certain regulatory violations. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nMedical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated. Promoting a device for a use outside of the cleared or approved intended use or population, that is, an off-label use, or making false, misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action. \n\nFurthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (\"QSR\"), which requires, among other things, periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. In addition, any facilities assembling kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs. The FDA also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and requires the reporting of certain recalls or other field safety corrective actions for medical devices. Issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in FDA enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above. Moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve. \n\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health threats, such as the recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and negatively impacted our operations, financial performance and cash flows. These effects continue, and their impact going forward is uncertain because the trajectory and nature of the pandemic remain uncertain and difficult to predict. Such effects depend on various factors, including, but not limited, to: the occurrence, spread, duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks, including the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus; governmental, business and individuals&#8217; actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel, transport and workforce pressures, and deferrals or \n\npostponements of elective procedures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the timing and pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, which could be impacted by a number of factors, including limited provider capacity to perform procedures using our products that were deferred as a result of the pandemic. \n\nWith respect to our company, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an impact on our operations, financial performance and financial condition in several ways, including, but not limited to, those discussed below: \n\n&#8226; It has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in our manufacturing operations globally, which are subject to governmental or regulatory actions taken in response to COVID-19. These actions could impact our ability, or that of our employees or suppliers, to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and create a risk to our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner, or at all. \n\n&#8226; The effects of the pandemic have caused, and could in the future continue to cause, disruptions in our workforce and our global supply chain. These disruptions, or our failure to respond to them, could increase manufacturing or distribution costs or cause further delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, products to our customers. \n\n&#8226; The effects of the pandemic have resulted, and could in the future continue to result, in lower revenues in certain of our product categories. \n\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other pandemics or epidemics, could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. However, these effects could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely, and such impact could be material. \n\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: \n\n&#8226; the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, one purpose of which is to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or soliciting payment for such referrals, purchases, orders and recommendations; \n\n&#8226; federal false claims laws which, among other things, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors; \n\n&#8226; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters; and \n\n&#8226; state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. \n\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. \n\nFurther, the Affordable Care Act, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists (including anesthesiology assistants) and certified nurse-midwives. The reported information is made \n\npublicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment, transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;). \n\nThere are also certain states, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont, that require device manufacturers to track and report payments or transfers of value provided to certain health care providers and health care entities. In addition, some states, such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandate implementation of compliance programs that include restrictions on certain interactions and items of value that may be provided to health care providers, as well as the tracking and reporting of certain items of value, compensation for consulting and other services, and other remuneration to healthcare providers. Further, we are subject to a law in Vermont that imposes a ban on providing certain items of value and payments to health care providers. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations. \n\nWe may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring, facility consolidations, realignment, cost reduction and other strategic initiatives. \n\nOver the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including facility consolidations, organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce, and we may engage in similar efforts in the future. While we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives, we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. In addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. Moreover, if our restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies, we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives. However, as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our ERP systems, we could experience business disruptions, which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations. In addition, any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs. Should we experience such difficulties, our business, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nDisruptions in sterilization of our products or regulatory initiatives further restricting the use of ethylene oxide in sterilization facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nMany of our products require sterilization prior to sale. A common method for sterilizing medical products involves the use of ethylene oxide, which is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act, as amended, and emissions of which are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and other regulatory authorities. Companies in the sterilization industry may face private litigation that could result in financial difficulties that could ultimately make it difficult or undesirable for such companies to continue in the sterilization business. In addition, sterilization activities are subject to substantial governmental oversight and attention that could disrupt their operations. One of our contract sterilizers, Sterigenics U.S., LLC, uses ethylene oxide in its sterilization process, including at its facilities in Smyrna, Cobb County, Georgia and Santa Teresa, New Mexico, which have sterilized some of our vascular, surgical, intermittent catheter and OEM products. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, operations at the Smyrna facility were suspended by state and local officials due to issues associated with the facility's use of ethylene oxide in its sterilization operations, but have since reopened. In December 2020, the New Mexico Attorney General initiated legal proceedings involving the Santa Teresa facility, alleging that its operations have resulted in impermissible ethylene oxide emissions. While both plants are currently operating normally, should their operations be suspended or adversely affected, our ability to provide affected \n\nproducts to our customers could be impaired if we are unable to utilize alternate facilities and sources for sterilization services. \n\nIn addition, on October 10, 2019, the attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia sent a letter to the EPA urging that the EPA promptly propose and finalize stricter standards for ethylene oxide emissions. Among other things, the attorneys general stated that the current EPA standard for ethylene oxide fails to adequately protect workers and communities, and that the use of ethylene oxide, particularly in the medical device sterilization industry, must be reduced. On December 12, 2019, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit information and request comments that will aid in the EPA&#8217;s future revisions of the regulations concerning ethylene oxide omissions. Subsequently, on September 13, 2021, the EPA issued an information collection request to commercial sterilization facilities to gather additional information and data about ethylene oxide sterilization processes and emissions. The EPA has indicated it expects to issue proposed regulations for commercial sterilizers in the near term. Any additional regulatory restrictions on the emission of ethylene oxide by sterilization facilities might impair our ability to provide sufficient quantities of sterilized products to our customers and compel us to seek sterilization alternatives that do not entail the use of ethylene oxide. We cannot assure that we would be able to identify such alternatives. In the event we were to experience any disruptions in our ability to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity constraints or regulatory or other impediments (including, among other things, regulatory initiatives directed generally to sterilization facilities that utilize ethylene oxide), or we are unable to transition to alternative facilities in a timely or cost effective manner in the event one or more of the facilities we use is affected, we could experience a material adverse impact with respect to our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nA significant portion of our U.S. revenues is derived from sales to distributors, and &#8220;destocking&#8221; activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. \n\nA significant portion of our revenues in the U.S. is derived from sales to distributors, which, in turn, sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions. From time to time, these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products, a practice we refer to as &#8220;destocking.&#8221; A distributor's decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors, such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product, distributor buying decisions (including decisions to purchase competing products), changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels, economic conditions and other factors. Following such instances of reduced purchases, distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels; nevertheless, we cannot assure that distributors will, in fact, increase purchases of our products in this manner. A decline in the level of product purchases by our U.S. distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period, and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect. \n\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, as well as product recalls, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective. \n\nOur businesses expose us to potential product liability risks related to the design, manufacture, labeling and marketing of our products. In particular, our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients. In addition, many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time. Product defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death. Product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages. The magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, and the related legal defense costs may be significant. We could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims. \n\nIn addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may voluntarily conduct, or be required by regulatory authorities to conduct, a recall of that product. In the event of a recall, we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or class-action litigation claims. Moreover, negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nVolatility in domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nWe are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions. The economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred several years ago led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending, resulting in reductions, delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services. We cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors. The continuation in a number of markets of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nAlthough we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy. If our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations. \n\nIn addition, adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. \n\nOur strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. \n\nOur strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets. If we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, as part of our strategy for growth, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. In this regard, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, technologies, services and products and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development, marketing and other resources, as well as significantly greater investments, than we anticipated. We could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets, asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business, including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance, as well as the short-term effects of increased costs on results of operations. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. There can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn connection with certain of our completed acquisitions, we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. As of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. On a quarterly basis, we reassess these obligations and, in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, we record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, we accrued $44.0 million of contingent consideration related to completed business combinations, most of which related to Standard Bariatrics. In addition, actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. For information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities, see &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; under Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of \n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding our acquisitions, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nHealth care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business. \n\nPolitical, economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. It also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act: \n\n&#8226; established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research; \n\n&#8226; implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; and \n\n&#8226; created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. \n\nWe cannot predict at this time the full impact of the Affordable Care Act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In this regard, several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were proposed, but not adopted in 2017. However, U.S. tax legislation adopted in December 2017 and commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") eliminated the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act, and may have other effects. Moreover, on December 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid, although the Court stayed its ruling pending appeal. The nature and effect of any modification or repeal of, or legislative substitution for, the Affordable Care Act, or any court decision regarding the act's validity, is uncertain, and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on the longer-term viability of the act, or on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with our non-U.S. operations. \n\nWe have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities, research and development facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the U.S., including Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Malaysia and Mexico. In addition, a significant portion of our non-U.S. revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of our full-time employees were employed in countries outside of the U.S., and approximately 55% of our net property, plant and equipment was located outside the U.S. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 36%, 37% and 38%, respectively, of our net revenues (based on the Teleflex entity generating the sale) were derived from operations outside the U.S. \n\nOur international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S., including: \n\n&#8226; exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values; \n\n&#8226; trade protection measures, tariffs and other duties, especially in light of trade disputes between the U.S. and several foreign countries, including China; \n\n&#8226; potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements; \n\n&#8226; laws and business practices that favor local companies; \n\n&#8226; changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures; \n\n&#8226; subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations; \n\n&#8226; substantial non-U.S. tax liabilities, including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws; \n\n&#8226; restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; \n\n&#8226; differing labor regulations; \n\n&#8226; additional U.S. and foreign government controls or regulations; \n\n&#8226; the impact of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"; \n\n&#8226; public health epidemics; \n\n&#8226; difficulties in the protection of intellectual property; and \n\n&#8226; unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against American interests. \n\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Similar anti-bribery laws are in effect in several foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials, and to prevent the establishment of &#8220;off the books&#8221; slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored health care systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees, distributors or other agents. In addition, we may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees, distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire. Violations of anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions, as well as harm to our reputation. \n\nFurthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the U.S., including the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. While we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nAdditionally, in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. government has imposed enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Although our sales into Russia did not constitute a material portion of our total revenue in 2022, further escalation of geopolitical tensions, including as a result of the imposition of additional economic sanctions, could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers in the broader region. \n\nForeign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results. \n\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Products manufactured in, and sold into, foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations. Our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates, which we refer to as \"non-functional currencies.\" A strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products, such as the euro, will affect our U.S. dollar-reported revenue and income. Although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations. \n\nMany of our products have significant plastic resin content. We also use quantities of other commodities, such as aluminum and steel. Increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers, particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nIncreases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers, thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need. In addition, our borrowing costs have been adversely affected by recent interest rate increases and could be further affected if interest rates continue to increase. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us. \n\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nAn interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business. \n\nMany of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations, and the availability of alternate facilities is limited. If operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events, including, without limitation, those due to climate change, we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all. Furthermore, our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. In addition, in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers, we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all. The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to delays in product releases, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution, or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOur ability to attract, train, develop and retain key employees is important to our success. \n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain key personnel, including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain other key employees, including research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel. We may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors, including: \n\n&#8226; the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions; \n\n&#8226; changes in our organizational structure; \n\n&#8226; our restructuring initiatives; \n\n&#8226; competitors&#8217; hiring practices; and \n\n&#8226; the effectiveness of our compensation programs. \n\nOur inability to attract, train, develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOur failure to maintain strong relationships with physicians and other health care professionals could adversely affect us. \n\nWe depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products. Physicians assist us as researchers, product consultants, inventors and public speakers. If we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and, as a result, no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice, our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur technology is important to our success, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage. \n\nWe rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. Although we own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications, we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue, or that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. In addition, we rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the U.S. We cannot assure that current and former employees, contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us, misappropriate proprietary information, copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop know-how and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own, which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed. \n\nOur products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products. \n\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. If we are found liable for infringement, we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products. We may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business. \n\nOther pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business. \n\nWe are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving, among other things, contracts, intellectual property, import and export regulations, and employment and environmental matters. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management&#8217;s attention and may involve significant legal expenses. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. While we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters, is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships. \n\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders, generate invoices, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise perform business functions. Our internal \n\ninformation technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases have caused significant harm. Although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security, we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. If we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could, among other things, lose customers, have difficulty preventing fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses, lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \n\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities. \n\nWe are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things: \n\n&#8226; the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; \n\n&#8226; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; \n\n&#8226; the impacts of industrial operations on climate change; and \n\n&#8226; the health and safety of our employees. \n\nThese laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup, will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe effects of climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nRisks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory and political focus in the U.S. and globally. While the effects of climate change in the near- and long-term are difficult to predict, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity and duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures or flooding, which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs of raw materials and components, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events. In addition, increased public concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which could result in increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations as well as adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOur workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 9% of our employees in the U.S. and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements. It is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. Strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business. \n\nRisks Relating to our Financing Arrangements \n\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated indebtedness of $1.7 billion. \n\nOur substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations. It could also have significant effects on our business. For example, it could: \n\n&#8226; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; \n\n&#8226; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate expenditures; \n\n&#8226; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for general corporate purposes; \n\n&#8226; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; restrict us from pursuing business opportunities; and \n\n&#8226; place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness. \n\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to: \n\n&#8226; refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; sell assets; \n\n&#8226; reduce or delay capital expenditures; or \n\n&#8226; seek to raise additional capital. \n\nWe may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions. \n\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur debt agreements impose restrictions on our business, which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities and taking other desirable corporate actions, and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. \n\nOur senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") and our 4.25% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\" and, together with the 2027 Notes, the \"Senior Notes\") contain covenants that, among other things, impose significant restrictions on our business. The restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries collectively include limitations on our and their ability to, among other things: \n\n&#8226; incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock; \n\n&#8226; create liens; \n\n&#8226; pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments; \n\n&#8226; sell assets; \n\n&#8226; merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and \n\n&#8226; enter into transactions with our affiliates. \n\nIn addition, our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants, including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement. A breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. In addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions. \n\nUnder our cross-currency swap agreements, a meaningful decline in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. \n\nIn 2018 and 2019, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements with several financial institutions to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. The swap agreements require an exchange of the notional amounts between us and the counterparties upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements. If, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate has \n\ndeclined from the rate in effect on the execution date, we are required to pay the counterparties an amount equal to the excess of the U.S. dollar value over the euro principal amount (we and the counterparties have agreed to a net settlement with regard to the exchange of the notional amounts at the date of expiration or earlier termination of the agreements). In the event of a significant decline in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, our payment obligations to the counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. In this regard, if, at the expiration or earlier termination of our swap agreements, the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate has declined by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of our agreements, we would be required to pay approximately $75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement. To the extent we enter into additional cross-currency swap agreements, a decline in the relevant exchange rates could further adversely affect our cash flows. \n\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock \n\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. \n\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding approximately 46.9 million shares of our common stock, options to purchase 1.2 million shares of our common stock (of which approximately 1.0 million were vested as of that date), restricted stock units covering 0.2 million shares of our common stock (which are expected to vest over the next three years), performance stock units covering a maximum of 62,927 shares of our common stock (which may vest in early 2023, depending on our performance with regard to specified financial measures and market performance of our common stock compared to designated public companies) and 123 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan. As of December 31, 2022, 2.8 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. \n\nIf we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. Furthermore, our issuance of shares upon the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options, as well as the vesting of restricted stock units and some or all of the performance stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and the subsequent sale in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. \n\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future. \n\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, requirements under covenants in our debt instruments, legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. We cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced, or eliminated, in the future. \n\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents, Delaware law and our Senior Notes could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition. \n\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series, the consideration, dividend rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights, if any, of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. These provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock. \n\nCertain provisions in the indentures governing the Senior Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon an acquisition event that constitutes a &#8220;change of control,&#8221; as defined in the indentures governing the Senior Notes, coupled with a downgrade in the ratings of the Senior Notes, holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. Our obligations under the Senior Notes \n\ncould increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits, improving \n\npatient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs. We primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. Approximately 95% of our net revenues come from single-use medical devices. We market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. Because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. We are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies. \n\nWe evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. Based on our evaluation, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. In addition, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, particularly in Asia, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors). Our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel. Further, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that no longer meet our objectives. \n\nAcquisitions \n\nOn June 13, 2022, we acquired a privately-owned catheter company for an initial cash payment of $22.8 million. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we may become obligated to make additional cash payments of up to $26.2 million if certain commercial and revenue goals are met. The acquisition, which complements our interventional product portfolio, principally consisted of a proprietary catheter design and other related intellectual property. \n\nOn September 27, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Standard Bariatrics, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that commercialized a powered stapling technology for bariatric surgery that complements our surgical product portfolio. The fair value of consideration transferred was $211.8 million, which included cash payments of $173.0 million and $38.8 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of our obligations, under the acquisition agreement, to make three milestone payments up to $130 million, in aggregate, if certain commercial milestones are met. The acquisition was financed using borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. \n\nDivestiture \n\nOn May 15, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain product lines within our global respiratory product portfolio to Medline for consideration of $286.0 million, reduced by $12 million in working capital not transferring to Medline (the \"Respiratory business divestiture\"). In connection with the Respiratory business divestiture, we also entered into several ancillary agreements with Medline to help facilitate the transfer of the business, which provide for transition support, quality, supply and manufacturing services, including a manufacturing and supply transition agreement (the \"MSTA\"). \n\nOn June 28, 2021, we completed the initial phase of the Respiratory business divestiture, pursuant to which we received cash proceeds of $259 million. The second phase of the Respiratory business divestiture will occur once we transfer certain additional manufacturing assets to Medline. Our receipt of $15.0 million in additional cash proceeds is contingent upon the transfer of these manufacturing assets and is expected to occur prior to the end of 2023. We plan to recognize the contingent consideration, and any gain on sale resulting from the second phase of the divestiture, when it becomes realizable. \n\nEconomic factors impacting our business \n\nThe residual effects from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact global economic conditions, which have affected our financial results and global operations, as well as our contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners. Consequently, we have experienced increased levels of overall cost inflation and challenges within our supply chain. Constraints on the supply of specific raw materials used to manufacture our products have and continue to impact delivery times and have resulted in an increased level of backorders. Moreover, pandemic related measures, as well as staffing shortages at healthcare facilities stemming from the pandemic, have and \n\ncontinue to result in varying levels of reduced demand within certain of our segments and product lines due to lower elective procedure volumes compared to pre-pandemic levels. \n\nWe continue to monitor the macro-economic impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing geopolitical conflicts, that have contributed to material and services inflation and exchange rate volatility, as well as trade and tariff activity. \n\nWe believe that the impacts stemming from the factors discussed above will continue to affect our business, and consequentially our financial position, results of operations and liquidity, particularly in the near term, and that such impact would be most significant if COVID-19 becomes more prevalent or geopolitical conflicts escalate. As a result of the dynamic nature of each of these factors, we cannot accurately predict the extent or duration of the impacts on our business. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nAs used in this discussion, \"new products\" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and &#8220;existing products&#8221; are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago. Discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. In addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors, either through acquisition or termination of the distributor, from the sales channel. All dollar amounts in tables are presented in millions unless otherwise noted. \n\nFor a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2021 and 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed on March 1, 2022. \n\nComparison of 2022 and 2021 \n\nRevenues ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Net Revenues $ 2,791.0 $ 2,809.6 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $18.6 million, or 0.7%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $124.5 million decrease in sales volumes of existing products, $97.0 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, a net decrease in sales volumes attributed to the Respiratory business divestiture. The decreases in revenue were partially offset by a $184.9 million increase in sales of new products and price increases. \n\nGross profit ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Gross profit \n\n$ 1,531.1 $ 1,549.6 Percentage of revenues \n\n54.9 % 55.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, gross margin decreased 30 basis points, or 0.5%, compared to the prior year period primarily due to continued cost inflation from macro-economic factors, specifically, logistics and distribution, raw materials and labor costs, partially offset by price increases and favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nSelling, general and administrative ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Selling, general and administrative \n\n$ 863.7 $ 860.1 Percentage of revenues \n\n30.9 % 30.6 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses across certain of our product portfolios, higher IT related costs, including support services, and operating expenses incurred by acquired businesses, primarily Standard Bariatrics. The increases in selling, general and administrative costs were partially offset by favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nResearch and development ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Research and development \n\n$ 153.8 $ 130.8 Percentage of revenues \n\n5.5 % 4.7 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to European Union Medical Device Regulation (\"EU MDR\") related costs and higher project spend within certain of our product portfolios. \n\nRestructuring and impairment charges \n\n2022 Restructuring plan \n\nOn November 15, 2022, we initiated a strategic restructuring plan designed to improve operating performance and position the organization to deliver long-term durable growth by creating efficiencies that align with our high growth strategic objectives (the &#8220;2022 restructuring plan&#8221;). The plan primarily involves the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations in addition to the streamlining of various business functions across the organization and related workforce reductions. These actions are expected to be substantially completed during 2023. \n\nWe estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2022 restructuring plan of $39 million to $48 million. We estimate that $26 million to $32 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, most of which are expected to be made in 2023. Additionally, we expect to incur approximately $2 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, most of which is expected to be incurred during 2023. \n\nWe currently expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2023 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $21 million to $23 million once the plan is fully implemented. \n\nRespiratory divestiture plan \n\nIn 2021, in connection with the Respiratory business divestiture, we committed to a restructuring plan designed to separate the manufacturing operations that will be transferred to Medline from those that will remain with Teleflex, which includes related workforce reductions (the &#8220;Respiratory divestiture plan&#8221;). The plan includes expanding certain of our existing locations to accommodate the transfer of capacity from the sites that will be transferred to Medline and replicating the manufacturing processes at alternate existing locations. We expect this plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2023. \n\nWe estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the Respiratory divestiture plan of $24 million to $30 million and substantially all of these charges will result in cash outlays. Additionally, we expect to incur $22 million to $28 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan. \n\n2019 Footprint realignment plan \n\nIn February 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations and related workforce reductions (the &#8220;2019 Footprint realignment plan\"). The plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan, if any, to be immaterial. \n\n2018 Footprint realignment plan \n\nIn May 2018, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain European manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the outsourcing of certain European distribution operations and related workforce reductions (the \"2018 Footprint realignment plan\"). The plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan, if any, to be immaterial. \n\n2014 Footprint realignment plan \n\nIn April 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities, and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain higher-cost locations to \n\nexisting lower-cost locations (the \"2014 Footprint realignment plan\"). The plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan, if any, to be immaterial. \n\nThe following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our restructuring programs, as well as impairment charges, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. The restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2022 Restructuring plan $ 15.5 $ &#8212; Respiratory divestiture plan 0.6 2.7 2021 Restructuring plan &#8212; 7.4 2019 Footprint realignment plan (1.0) 0.3 2018 Footprint realignment plan 2.1 2.5 Other restructuring programs 1.6 2.1 \n\nImpairment charges (1) \n\n1.5 6.7 Total $ 20.3 $ 21.7 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $1.5 million related to our decision to abandon certain assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $6.7 million related to our decision to abandon intellectual property and other assets primarily associated with our respiratory product portfolio that was not transferred to Medline as part of the Respiratory business divestiture. \n\nInterest expense ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Interest expense \n\n$ 54.3 $ 57.0 Average interest rate on debt during the year \n\n2.8 % 2.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding, partially offset by a higher average interest rate resulting from increases in interest rates associated with our variable interest rate debt instruments. \n\nGain on sale of assets and business ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Gain on sale of assets and business \n\n$ 6.5 $ 91.2 ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain related to a sale of a building. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain related to the Respiratory business divestiture. \n\nLoss on extinguishment of debt ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Loss on extinguishment of debt \n\n$ 0.5 $ 13.0 ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 we recognized a $0.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the write off of unamortized deferring financing costs related to the amendment of our senior credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate outstanding principal amount under our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\"). In addition to the prepayment of principal, we paid to the holders of the 2026 Notes a $9.8 million prepayment make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded the prepayment make-whole amount and a $3.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt. \n\nTaxes on income from continuing operations ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Effective income tax rate \n\n18.6 % 13.3 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2022 reflects tax expense resulting from a deferred charge relating to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and tax expense resulting from a U.S. law effective in 2022 requiring capitalization of certain research and development expenditures. The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflects tax expense associated with the Respiratory business divestiture. Additionally, the effective tax rates for both 2022 and 2021 reflect a net \n\nexcess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a tax benefit from research and development tax credits. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law, which, among other things, implemented a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations. We continue to evaluate the impact the law will have on consolidated results of operations, but it is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn December 2022, the EU adopted a directive that requires each EU Member State to enact national legislation establishing a 15% global minimum tax that is required to become effective in 2024. Although specific provisions of the proposed future laws of the individual Member States are not fully known at this time, we anticipate that potential enactments of these laws by the Member States could impact our tax obligations in future periods. \n\nSegment Results \n\nSegment Net Revenues \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31 % Increase/(Decrease) &#160; 2022 2021 2022 vs 2021 Americas $ 1,653.7 $ 1,659.3 (0.3) EMEA 558.4 606.8 (8.0) Asia 306.3 297.8 2.9 OEM 272.6 245.7 11.0 Segment Net Revenues $ 2,791.0 $ 2,809.6 (0.7) ##TABLE_END\n\nSegment Operating Profit \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, % Increase/(Decrease) &#160; 2022 2021 2022 vs 2021 Americas $ 452.0 $ 424.2 6.6 EMEA 42.5 94.9 (55.2) Asia 82.8 84.6 (2.2) OEM 65.4 56.2 16.3 Segment Operating Profit (1) \n\n$ 642.7 $ 659.9 (2.6) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment operating profit to our consolidated income from continuing operations before interest, loss on extinguishment of debt and taxes. \n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $5.6 million, or 0.3%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to a $192.9 million decrease in sales volume of existing products and, to a lesser extent, a net decrease in sales volumes attributed to the Respiratory business divestiture. The decreases in revenue were partially offset by a $175.1 million increase in sales of new products and price increases. \n\nAmericas operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $27.8 million, or 6.6%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to lower performance related employee-benefit expenses, a decrease in contingent consideration expense and lower general and administrative expenses. The increases in operating profit were partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses across certain of our product portfolios. \n\nEMEA \n\nEMEA net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $48.4 million, or 8.0%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to $63.9 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes of existing products. \n\nEMEA operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $52.4 million, or 55.2%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in EU MDR costs within research and development. \n\nIn 2015, the Italian parliament enacted legislation that, among other things, imposed a &#8220;payback&#8221; measure on medical device companies that supply goods and services to the Italian National Healthcare System. Under the measure, companies are required to make payments to the Italian government if medical device expenditures in a given year exceed regional expenditure ceilings established for that year. The payment amounts are calculated based on the amount by which the regional ceilings for the given year were exceeded. Considerable uncertainty exists related to the enforceability of and implementation process for the payback law. In response to decrees issued by the Italian Ministry of Health, the various Italian regions issued invoices to medical device companies, including Teleflex, under the payback measure in the fourth quarter of 2022 seeking payment with respect to excess expenditures for the years 2015 through 2018. Following the issuance of the invoices, we and numerous other medical device companies filed appeals with the Italian administrative courts challenging the enforceability of the payback measure, which appeals remain pending. As of December 31, 2022, our reserve for this matter is $10.9 million, $2.6 million of which was recorded as a reduction of revenue for 2022. If the payback was to ultimately be enforced in its existing form, we estimate that we would be required to remit payments in excess of our current reserve of up to $23 million. \n\nAsia \n\nAsia net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $8.5 million, or 2.9%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to a $30.1 million increase in sales volumes of existing products, partially offset by $23.7 million of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nAsia operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $1.8 million, or 2.2%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a benefit recognized in the prior year resulting from the reversal of a contingent liability related to tariffs imposed by Chinese authorities, which is described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, partially offset by an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales. \n\nOEM \n\nOEM net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $26.9 million, or 11.0% compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a $21.7 million increase in sales volumes of existing products and price increases, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nOEM operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $9.2 million, or 16.3%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales volume, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash flows provided by operating activities. Our cash flows provided by operating activities are reduced by cash used to, among other things, fulfill contractual obligations for minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases, which often extend beyond one year; the weighted average remaining lease term of our operating lease portfolio is 7.9 years. Our cash flows provided by operating activities are also reduced by cash used for unconditional legally binding commitments to purchase goods or services (i.e., purchase obligations), which are primarily related to inventory expected to be purchased within one year. \n\nOther significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include contractual obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness and tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, which will be paid annually over the next three years. We may also be obligated to make payments for contingent consideration due to past acquisitions, the timing and amount of which may be uncertain, and the magnitude of which can vary from year to year. Other significant factors that affect our liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends. See Note 10, Note 12 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nWe believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under the Credit Agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. \n\nOf our $292.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, $256.9 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis. \n\nWe have entered into cross-currency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements, we notionally exchanged in the aggregate $750 million for &#8364;653.1 million. The swap agreements, which begin to expire in October 2023, are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements. We and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. As a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination dates, between the U.S. dollar equivalent of the &#8364;653.1 million notional amount and the $750 million notional amount. If, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or declined by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements, we would receive from or be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately $75.0 million in respect of the notional settlement. As of December 31, 2022, we had $48.5 million in current assets and $11.9 million in non-current assets related to the fair value of our cross-currency swap agreements. The swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. However, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties, all of which are large, well-established financial institutions. \n\nWe may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases, via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise, at such price or prices as we deem appropriate. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time. \n\nSummarized Financial Information &#8211; Obligor Group \n\nThe 2027 Notes are issued by Teleflex Incorporated (the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;), and payment of the Parent Company's obligations under the 2027 Notes is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by an enumerated group of the Parent Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (each, a &#8220;Guarantor Subsidiary&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Guarantor Subsidiaries&#8221;). The guarantees are full and unconditional, subject to certain customary release provisions. Each Guarantor Subsidiary is directly or indirectly 100% owned by the Parent Company. Summarized financial information for the Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Obligor Group&#8221;) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 \n\nObligor Group Intercompany Obligor Group (excluding intercompany) Net revenue $ 1,983.0 $ 196.5 $ 1,786.5 Cost of goods sold 1,208.6 323.3 885.3 Gross profit 774.4 (126.8) 901.2 Income from continuing operations 292.7 125.4 167.3 Net income 292.4 125.4 167.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 \n\nObligor Group Intercompany Obligor Group (excluding intercompany) Total current assets $ 878.3 $ 110.5 $ 767.8 Total assets 3,420.3 1,510.9 1,909.4 Total current liabilities 882.9 627.9 255.0 Total liabilities 3,168.0 712.3 2,455.7 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe same accounting policies as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 are used by the Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries in connection with the summarized financial information presented above. The Intercompany column in the table above represents transactions between and among the Obligor Group and non-guarantor subsidiaries (i.e., those subsidiaries of the Parent Company that have not guaranteed payment of the 2027 Notes). Obligor \n\ninvestments in non-guarantor subsidiaries and any related activity are excluded from the financial information presented above. \n\nSee \"Financing Arrangements\" below as well as Note 10 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to our borrowings and financial instruments. \n\nCash Flows \n\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented: ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash flows from continuing operations provided by (used in): \n\nOperating activities \n\n$ 342.8 $ 652.1 Investing activities \n\n(259.4) 156.7 Financing activities \n\n(217.5) (715.8) Cash flows provided by (used in) discontinued operations \n\n0.8 (0.7) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents \n\n(19.8) (23.1) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents \n\n$ (153.1) $ 69.2 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $342.8 million during 2022, and $652.1 million during 2021. The $309.3 million decrease was primarily attributable to less favorable operating results and unfavorable changes in working capital. The unfavorable change in working capital was primarily attributable to a decrease in income taxes due to higher tax payments, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily due to higher payroll and benefit related payments, and an increase in inventories due to purchases to maintain customer service levels during a period of elevated global supply chain volatility. \n\nCash Flow from Investing Activities \n\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $259.4 million during 2022, primarily consisted of $198.4 million in net payments for businesses and intangibles acquired and $79.2 million of capital expenditures. \n\nCash Flow from Financing Activities \n\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $217.5 million during 2022, which primarily consisted of a net reduction in borrowings of $140.3 million resulting from payments made against our senior credit facility and $63.8 million in dividend payments. \n\nFor a discussion of our cash flow comparison for 2021 and 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed on March 1, 2022. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. This financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends and fund acquisitions. We also use this financial measure for internal managerial purposes and to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations \n\n$ 342.8 $ 652.1 Less: Capital expenditures \n\n79.2 71.6 Free cash flow \n\n$ 263.6 $ 580.5 ##TABLE_END\n\nFinancing Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Net debt includes: Current borrowings $ 87.5 $ 110.0 Long-term borrowings 1,624.0 1,740.1 Unamortized debt issuance costs 11.8 13.4 Total debt 1,723.3 1,863.5 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 292.0 445.1 Net debt 1,431.3 1,418.4 Total capital includes: &#160; &#160; Net debt 1,431.3 1,418.4 Shareholders&#8217; equity 4,022.0 3,754.7 Total capital $ 5,453.3 $ 5,173.1 Percent of net debt to total capital 26.2 % 27.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nFixed rate debt comprised 58.0% and 53.7% of total debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings as of December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year was due to payments made on our senior credit facility. \n\nSenior credit facility \n\nOn November 4, 2022, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement by entering into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $500.0 million. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, by a lien on substantially all of the assets owned by us and each guarantor. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility under the Credit Agreement is November 4, 2027. \n\nAt our option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.125% to 2.00% or at an alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (i) the &#8220;Prime Rate&#8221; in the U.S. last quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (ii) 0.50% above the greater of the federal funds rate and the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar transactions denominated in Dollars and (iii) 1.00% above the Term SOFR Rate for a one month interest period, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 1.00%, in each case subject to adjustments based on our total net leverage ratio. Overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus 2.00%. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $148.3 million in borrowings outstanding and $0.9 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and thresholds, (a) place limitations on us and our subsidiaries regarding the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional liens, fundamental changes, dispositions of property, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, restrictive agreements, changes in lines of business and swap agreements, and (b) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with sanction laws and other laws and agreements, to deliver financial information and certain other information and give notice of certain events, to maintain their existence and good standing, to pay their other obligations, to permit the administrative agent and the lenders to inspect their books and property, to use the proceeds of the Credit Agreement only for certain permitted purposes and to provide collateral in the future. Subject to certain exceptions, \n\nwe are required to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00. We are further required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement. \n\n2027 and 2028 Senior Notes \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of our 2027 Notes and 2028 Notes (collectively the \"Senior Notes\") was $500 million, respectively. The indenture governing the Senior Notes contains covenants that, among other things among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. The obligations under the Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the Credit Agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our Senior Notes. \n\nAccounts receivable securitization \n\nWe have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $75 million to a commercial paper conduit. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we borrowed the maximum amount available of $75 million under this facility. This facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. The agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. An occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred. \n\nFor additional information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions. \n\nWe have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nInventory Utilization \n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence. \n\nWe review the net realizable value of inventory each reporting period and adjust as necessary. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage. Our inventory reserve was $47.1 million and $42.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nLong-Lived Assets \n\nWe assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the \n\nasset. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. The recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development (\"IPR&#38;D\")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights and non-competition agreements) and are, generally, obtained through acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. Considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination. \n\nThe costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. Such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. For purposes of this assessment, our reporting units are our operating segments, or, in certain cases, a business one level below our operating segments. As the fair values of our reporting units are more likely than not greater than the carrying values, no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nIn applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test described below. Alternatively, we may test goodwill for impairment through the quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis. \n\nUnder a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. We calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the Income Approach) and one which is based on revenue and EBITDA of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the Market Approach). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. \n\nThe more significant judgments and assumptions in determining fair value using in the Income Approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) the discount rates that are used to estimate the present value of the future cash flows, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs. The more significant judgments and assumptions used in the Market Approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and EBITDA multiples used to estimate a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. There were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2022 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years. \n\nOur expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business \n\nplans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. Changes in assumptions underlying the Income Approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. While we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. In this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges. Moreover, changes in revenue and EBITDA multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges. \n\nOther Intangible Assets \n\n&#160; \n\nIntangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. Alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test. \n\nIn connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and quantitative impairment tests, we determine the estimated fair value using various methods under the Income Approach. The more significant judgments and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets may include revenue growth rates, royalty rate, discount rate, attrition rate, and EBITDA margin. Each of these factors and assumptions can significantly impact the value of the intangible asset. \n\nWe did not record any impairment charges related to intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $6.7 million related to our decision to abandon intellectual property and other assets primarily associated with our respiratory product portfolio that were not transferred to Medline as part of the Respiratory business divestiture. See \"Restructuring and impairment charges\" within \"Result of Operations\" above as well as Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these charges. \n\nContingent Consideration Liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\nIn connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. In a business combination, we record a contingent liability, as of the acquisition date, representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. We determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the Standard Bariatrics acquisition, which represented most of our contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2022, using a Monte Carlo valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. We determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration. Increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. Increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements; decreases may have the opposite effect. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nWe remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities' fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we accrued $44.0 million and $9.8 million of contingent consideration, respectively, related to completed business combinations. \n\nIf the transaction is determined to be an asset acquisition rather than a business combination, a contingent consideration liability is recognized when the specified objective is deemed probable and is estimable. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The difficulties inherent in such assessments, judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions. As a result, we are at times subject to tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. In connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters. \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and non-U.S. tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material. \n\nIn assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $91.5 million and $143.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. We are currently under examination in Ireland. Germany and France. The ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions. \n\nNew Accounting Standards \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nWe are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. \n\nWe also are exposed to changes in the market trading price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances. The table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates on December 31, 2022 were determined using a base rate of the one-month LIBOR rate plus the applicable spread. \n\n##TABLE_START Year of Maturity &#160; &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 500 $ 500.0 $ 1,000.0 Average interest rate &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 4.625 % 4.250 % 4.438 % Variable rate debt $ 87.5 $ 12.5 $ 25.0 $ 25.0 $ 573.3 $ &#8212; $ 723.3 Average interest rate 5.206 % 5.798 % 5.798 % 5.798 % 5.798 % &#8212; % 5.726 % ##TABLE_END\n\nA change of 1.0% in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by $7.2 million based on our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022. \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\nThe global nature of our operations exposes us to foreign currency risks. These risks include exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables as well as intercompany loans relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than a location&#8217;s functional currency and exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Mexican Peso, Malaysia Ringgit, Czech Koruna, Canadian Dollar, and British Pound. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts to attempt to minimize our exposure to these risks. Gains and losses on these contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total notional amount for the foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rates swap contracts, expressed in U.S. dollars, was $337.7 million and $750.0 million, respectively. A sensitivity analysis of changes in fair value of these contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022, while not predictive in nature, indicated that a hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these contracts by $68.2 million, the majority of which relates to the cross-currency interest rate swap contracts. \n\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the accounting treatment of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rates swap contracts. \n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide \n\nabsolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. We acquired Standard Bariatrics on September 27, 2022. Consistent with the guidance provided by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has excluded Standard Bariatrics from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The net revenues attributable to Standard Bariatrics from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022, represent, in the aggregate, less than 1% of our consolidated net revenues for the year then ended, and the total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) attributable to Standard Bariatrics represent, in the aggregate, less than 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022. \n\n(b) Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management&#8217;s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference herein. \n\n(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with our acquisition of Standard Bariatrics, we are in the process of evaluating the acquired company's internal controls to determine the extent to which modifications to Standard Bariatrics' internal controls would be appropriate. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

OTHER INFORMATION \n\nOn February 21, 2023, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved an amendment and restatement of our Bylaws to provide our stockholders with the right to call a special meeting of stockholders (the &#8220;Special Meeting Amendment&#8221;) and to make other administrative changes primarily to reflect recent Delaware law developments (the &#8220;Administrative Amendments&#8221;), in each case as further described below. \n\nSpecial Meeting Amendment \n\nPrior to this amendment, our Bylaws provided that only the Board could call a special meeting of stockholders. The Special Meeting Amendment generally provides one or more stockholders who have owned continuously for at least one year at least 20% of all outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock the right to call a special meeting of stockholders, subject to the requirements and procedures set forth in the Special Meeting Amendment. \n\nAdministrative Amendments \n\nThe Board also approved the Administrative Amendments to the Bylaws to conform the Company&#8217;s notice provision with the applicable Delaware statute and to incorporate a new Delaware law provision related to notices of adjournments, including with respect to remote meetings of stockholders. In addition, the Administrative Amendments provide that any stockholder soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which color is reserved for the exclusive use by the Board. \n\nThe foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference. \n\n"

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the framework established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective. \n\nThe Company acquired Standard Bariatrics on September 27, 2022. Management has excluded Standard Bariatrics from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The net revenues attributable to Standard Bariatrics from their respective dates of acquisition through December 31, 2022, represent, in the aggregate, less than 1% of our consolidated net revenues for the year then ended and total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) attributable to Standard Bariatrics represent, in the aggregate, less than 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START /s/ Liam J. Kelly /s/ Thomas E. Powell \n\nLiam J. Kelly \n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer \n\nThomas E. Powell \n\n&#160; \n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nF-2 \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex Incorporated \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule, of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Standard Bariatrics from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Standard Bariatrics from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Standard Bariatrics is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management&#8217;s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting \n\nF-3 \n\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAcquisition of Standard Bariatrics, Inc. - Valuation of Intellectual Property Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration \n\nAs described in Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Standard Bariatrics, Inc. (&#8220;Standard Bariatrics&#8221;) on September 27, 2022. The fair value of consideration transferred was $211.8 million, which included cash payments of $173.0 million and $38.8 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation approach. Inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities include revenue growth rates (based on internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans), revenue volatility, discount rates, probability of payment and projected payment dates. Identifiable intangible assets acquired included $128.3 million of intellectual property intangible assets. As disclosed by management, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value using various methods under the income approach. The more significant judgments and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets may include revenue growth rates, royalty rate, discount rate, attrition rate, and EBITDA margin. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of intellectual property intangible assets and contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Standard Bariatrics is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the intellectual property intangible assets and contingent consideration; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rate, and EBITDA margin for the intellectual property intangible assets and revenue growth rates, revenue volatility, discount rate, probability of payment and projected payment dates for the contingent consideration; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing of the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management&#8217;s valuation of the intellectual property intangible assets and contingent consideration related to the acquisition. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement and (ii) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the fair value estimates of the intellectual property intangible assets and contingent consideration. Testing management&#8217;s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the valuation methods, and evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant assumptions. Evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, revenue volatility and EBITDA margins involved considering the current and past performance of the Standard Bariatrics business, the consistency with economic and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumption related to projected \n\nF-4 \n\npayment dates involved evaluating whether the assumption used was reasonable considering the terms of the purchase agreement. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods and the reasonableness of the discount rate for the intellectual property intangible assets and the revenue volatility, probability of payment and discount rate for the contingent consideration. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1962. \n\nF-5 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME ##TABLE_START &#160;

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and reflect management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. \n\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nCash and cash equivalents: All highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates the current market value. \n\nAccounts receivable: Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers related to the sale of products and provision of services. Our allowance for credit losses is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable and losses expected to be incurred over the life of our receivables. Considerations to determine credit losses include our historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer, information provided by credit rating services, as well as the consideration of events or circumstances indicating historic collection rates may not be indicative of future collectability. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 8.6 million and $ 10.8 million, respectively. The current portion of the allowance for credit losses, which was $ 4.9 million and $ 6.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, was recognized as a reduction of accounts receivable, net. \n\nInventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of our inventories is determined using the average cost method. Elements of cost in inventory include raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In estimating net realizable value, we evaluate inventory for excess and obsolete quantities based on estimated usage and sales, among other factors. \n\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage generally are capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements result in additional functionality. Other additions and those improvements which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful lives of the assets are also capitalized. Composite useful lives for categories of property, plant and equipment, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis, are as follows: buildings &#8212; 30 years; machinery and equipment &#8212; 3 to 15 years; computer equipment and software &#8212; 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful lives of the leasehold improvements or the remaining lease term. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Impairment losses, if any, are included in income from operations. The goodwill impairment test is applied to each of our reporting units. For purposes of this assessment, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business one level below an operating segment (also known as a component) if discrete financial information is prepared for that business and regularly reviewed by segment management. However, separate components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. \n\nIn performing the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment \n\nF-11 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\ntest, described below. Alternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. Under a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the reporting unit fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We did not record a goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nOur intangible assets consist of customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights, in-process research and development (\"IPR&#38;D\"), trade names and non-competition agreements. We define IPR&#38;D as the value of technology acquired for which the related projects have substance and are incomplete. IPR&#38;D acquired in a business acquisition is recognized at fair value and is required be capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion of the IPR&#38;D project or upon abandonment. Upon completion of the development project (generally when regulatory approval to market the product that utilizes the technology is obtained), an impairment assessment is performed prior to amortizing the asset over its estimated useful life. If the IPR&#38;D projects are abandoned, the related IPR&#38;D assets would be written off. \n\nWe test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. \n\nIntangible assets that do not have indefinite lives, consisting of intellectual property, customer relationships, distribution rights, certain trade names and non-competition agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows: intellectual property, 5 to 20 years; customer relationships, 8 to 27 years; distribution rights, 10 years; trade names, 10 to 30 years; non-compete agreement, 6 years. The weighted average remaining amortization period with respect to our intangible assets is approximately 15 years. We periodically evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. \n\nLong-lived assets: We assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The assessment is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate, as applicable, the impact of the asset on the existing business. Therefore, the evaluation involves significant management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. \n\nForeign currency translation: Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-United States dollar denominated functional currencies are translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nDerivative financial instruments: We use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as other comprehensive income (loss), if the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item. Gains or losses on derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which such gains and losses occur. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which either such event occurs. For non-designated derivatives, gains and losses are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of cash flows in a manner consistent with the recognition of the underlying transactions. \n\nShare-based compensation: We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest, which is derived, in \n\nF-12 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\npart, following consideration of estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. Share-based compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to the expected life of the options, volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. The expected life of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock, which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than would be the case if we only used historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on United States (or \"U.S.\") Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on management&#8217;s expectations regarding the extent to which awards ultimately will vest and are adjusted for actual forfeitures when they occur. \n\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, and to reflect operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except to the extent that such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Interest accrued with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and income tax related penalties are both included in taxes on income from continuing operations. We periodically assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to an adjustment become known. \n\nPensions and other postretirement benefits: We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including benefits available pursuant to pension and postretirement healthcare benefits plans. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. The effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. \n\nRestructuring costs: We primarily recognize employee termination benefits when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable because they are provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement and are based on existing plans, historical experience and negotiated settlements of prior plans. Termination benefits provided under one-time termination benefits arrangements, if any, are recognized upon communication to the employee. We recognize charges ratably over the future service period if the employee is required to render service until termination. Other restructuring costs may include facility closure, employee relocation, equipment relocation and outplacement costs and are recognized in the period they are incurred. \n\nContingent consideration related to business acquisitions: In connection with business acquisitions, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. In a business combination, we record a contingent liability, as of the acquisition date, representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration that we expect to pay. We remeasure the fair value of our contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period and, based on new developments, record changes in fair value until either the contingent consideration obligation is satisfied through payment upon the achievement of, or the obligation no longer exists due to the failure to achieve, the specified objectives. The change in the fair value is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. A contingent consideration payment is classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows to the extent it was recorded as a liability as of the acquisition date. Any additional amount paid in excess of the amount initially accrued is classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. \n\nF-13 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nIf the transaction is determined to be an asset acquisition rather than a business combination, a contingent consideration liability is recognized when the specified objective is deemed probable and is estimable. \n\nRevenue recognition: We primarily generate revenue from the sale of medical devices including single use disposable devices and, to a lesser extent, reusable devices, instruments and capital equipment. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; this occurs upon the transfer of control of the products. Generally, transfer of control to the customer occurs at the point in time when our products are shipped from the manufacturing or distribution facility. For the OEM segment, most revenue is recognized over time because the OEM segment generates revenue from the sale of custom products that have no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment to the extent that performance has been completed. We market and sell products through our direct sales force and distributors to customers within the following end markets: (1) hospitals and healthcare providers; (2) other medical device manufacturers; and (3) home care providers, which represented 88 %, 10 % and 2 % of our consolidated net revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods. With respect to the custom products sold in the OEM segment, revenue is measured using the units produced output method. Payment is generally due 30 days from the date of invoice. \n\nWe have made the following revenue accounting policy elections and elected to use certain practical expedients: (1) we account for amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes, net of related amounts remitted to tax authorities; (2) we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because, at contract inception, we expect the period between the time when we transfer a promised good or service to the customer and the time when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less; (3) we expense costs to obtain a contract as they are incurred if the expected period of benefit, and therefore the amortization period, is one year or less; (4) we account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control transfers to the customer as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service; (5) we classify shipping and handling costs within cost of goods sold; and (6) with respect to the OEM segment, we have applied the practical expedient to exclude disclosure of remaining performance obligations as the contracts typically have a term of one year or less. \n\nThe amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies as a result of changes in customer sales incentives, including discounts and rebates, and returns offered to customers. The estimate of revenue is adjusted upon the earlier of the following events: (i) the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received changes or (ii) the consideration becomes fixed. Our policy is to accept returns only in cases in which the product is defective and covered under our standard warranty provisions. When we give customers the right to return products, we estimate the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience. The liability for returns and allowances was $ 17.9 million and $ 15.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In estimating customer rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer&#8217;s rebate claim, customer-specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, historical experience with respect to specific customers (as we have a history of providing similar rebates on similar products to similar customers) and other relevant information. The reserve for customer incentive programs, including customer rebates, was $ 29.0 million and $ 26.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect the amounts subject to the reserve as of December 31, 2022 to be paid within 90 days subsequent to period-end. \n\nLeases: We have made an accounting policy election not to apply the lease accounting recognition provisions to short term leases (leases with a lease term of 12 months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise); instead, we will recognize the lease payments for short term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have made an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components and instead will account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. \n\nNote 2 &#8212; Recently issued accounting standards \n\nFrom time to time, new accounting guidance issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies is adopted as of the specified effective date or, when permitted by the guidance and as determined by us, as of an earlier date. We have assessed recently issued guidance that is not yet effective and believe the new guidance that we have assessed will not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. \n\nF-14 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNote 3 - Net revenues \n\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by global product category for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Vascular access $ 683,612 &#160; $ 700,240 &#160; $ 657,703 &#160; Anesthesia 388,890 &#160; 380,140 &#160; 302,293 &#160; Interventional 445,018 &#160; 427,500 &#160; 382,435 &#160; Surgical 392,917 &#160; 377,756 &#160; 317,200 &#160; Interventional urology 322,832 &#160; 341,661 &#160; 290,022 &#160; OEM 272,624 &#160; 245,681 &#160; 220,246 &#160; \n\nOther (1) \n\n285,148 &#160; 336,585 &#160; 367,257 &#160; Net revenues (2) \n\n$ 2,791,041 &#160; $ 2,809,563 &#160; $ 2,537,156 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes revenues generated from sales of our respiratory and urology products (other than interventional urology products). Certain product lines within the respiratory product category were sold during 2021. See Note 4 for additional information related to the Respiratory business divestiture. \n\n(2) The product categories listed above are presented on a global basis, while each of our reportable segments other than the OEM reportable segment are defined based on the geographic location of its operations; the OEM reportable segment operates globally. Each of the geographically based reportable segments includes net revenues from each of the non-OEM product categories listed above. \n\nNote 4 &#8212; Acquisitions and Divestiture \n\nOn September 27, 2022, the second day of the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Standard Bariatrics, Inc. (&#8220;Standard Bariatrics&#8221;), a privately-held medical device company that commercialized a powered stapling technology for bariatric surgery that complements our surgical product portfolio. The fair value of consideration transferred was $ 211.8 million, which included cash payments of $ 173.0 million and $ 38.8 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of our obligations, under the acquisition agreement, to make three milestone payments up to $ 130 million in aggregate if certain commercial milestones are met. The milestone payments are based on net sales growth over the three-year period following the closing of the transaction. The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation approach. See Note 12 for additional information on the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration. The acquisition was financed using borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. \n\nThe following table presents the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with respect to the Standard Bariatrics acquisition: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in thousands) Assets Current assets $ 8,028 &#160; Property, plant and equipment 3,342 &#160; Intangible assets 154,450 &#160; Goodwill 71,420 &#160; Other assets 2,122 &#160; Total assets acquired 239,362 &#160; Less: Current liabilities 2,661 &#160; Other liabilities 24,896 &#160; Liabilities assumed 27,557 &#160; Net assets acquired $ 211,805 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-15 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe goodwill resulting from the Standard Bariatrics acquisition primarily reflects synergies currently expected to be realized from the integration of the acquired business and is not tax deductible. \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the ranges of the useful lives as of the date of the Standard Bariatrics acquisition: \n\n##TABLE_START Standard Bariatrics Fair value Useful life (years) Intellectual property $ 128,300 &#160; 15 Trade names 22,500 &#160; 25 Customer relationships 3,650 &#160; 11 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $ 1.3 million in transaction expenses associated with the Standard Bariatrics acquisition, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Pro forma information for the Standard Bariatrics acquisition is not presented as the operations of Standard Bariatrics are not deemed to be significant to our overall operations. \n\nAsset Acquisition \n\nOn June 13, 2022, we acquired a privately-owned catheter company for an initial cash payment of $ 22.8 million. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we may become obligated to make additional cash payments up to $ 26.2 million if certain commercial and revenue goals are met. The acquisition, which complements our interventional product portfolio, principally consisted of a proprietary catheter design and other related intellectual property, being amortized over a useful life of 15 years. \n\nDivestiture \n\nOn May 15, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain product lines within our global respiratory product portfolio (the \"Divested respiratory business\") to Medline Industries, Inc. (&#8220;Medline&#8221;) for consideration of $ 286.0 million, reduced by $ 12.0 million in working capital not transferring to Medline, which is subject to customary post close adjustments (the \"Respiratory business divestiture\"). In connection with the Respiratory business divestiture, we also entered into several ancillary agreements with Medline to help facilitate the transfer of the business, which provide for transition support, quality, supply and manufacturing services, including a manufacturing and supply transition agreement (the \"MSTA\"). \n\nOn June 28, 2021, we completed the initial phase of the Respiratory business divestiture, pursuant to which we received cash proceeds of $ 259.0 million. The second phase of the Respiratory business divestiture will occur once we transfer certain additional manufacturing assets to Medline. Our receipt of $ 15.0 million in additional cash proceeds is contingent upon the transfer of these manufacturing assets and is expected to occur prior to the end of 2023. We plan to recognize the contingent consideration, and any gain on sale resulting from the second phase of the divestiture, when it becomes realizable. \n\nNet revenues attributable to our divested respiratory business recognized prior to the Respiratory business divestiture are included within each of our geographic segments and were $ 60.7 million and $ 138.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net revenues attributed to services provided to Medline in accordance with the MSTA, which are presented within our Americas reporting segment, were $ 79.1 million and $ 51.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nSupplemental cash flow information \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Non cash investing and financing activities of continuing operations: Acquisition of businesses $ 43,168 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nF-16 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nNote 5 &#8212; Restructuring and impairment charges \n\n2022 restructuring plan \n\nOn November 15, 2022, we initiated a strategic restructuring plan designed to improve operating performance and position the organization to deliver long-term durable growth by creating efficiencies that align with our high growth strategic objectives (the &#8220;2022 restructuring plan&#8221;). The plan primarily involves the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations in addition to the streamlining of various business functions across the organization and related workforce reductions. These actions are expected to be substantially completed during 2023. \n\nThe following table provides a summary of the cost estimates by major type of expense associated with the 2022 restructuring plan: \n\n##TABLE_START Total estimated amount expected to be incurred Plan expense estimates: (Dollars in millions) Termination benefits $ 18 million to $ 22 million \n\nOther costs (1) \n\n$ 1 million to $ 1 million \n\nRestructuring Charges $ 19 million to $ 23 million \n\nRestructuring related charges (2) \n\n$ 20 million to $ 25 million \n\nTotal restructuring and restructuring related charges $ 39 million to $ 48 million \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes facility closure and outplacement costs. \n\n(2) Restructuring related charges represent costs that are directly related to the program and principally comprise costs to transfer manufacturing operations to the existing lower-cost locations, project management costs and accelerated depreciation. The plan also includes an $ 8.1 million non cash tax related charge arising from establishing a valuation allowance against a local deferred tax asset, which is no longer expected to be utilized as a result of the transfer. Excluding this tax charge, the majority of the restructuring related charges are expected to be recognized within cost of goods sold. \n\nWe estimate that $ 26 million to $ 32 million of the restructuring and restructuring related charges will result in cash outlays, most of which are expected to be made in 2023. Additionally, we expect to incur approximately $ 2 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan, most of which is expected to be incurred during 2023. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $ 10.1 million in restructuring related charges, which were recognized in cost of goods sold and taxes on income from continuing operations. \n\nRespiratory divestiture plan \n\nDuring 2021 and in connection with the Respiratory business divestiture, we committed to a restructuring plan designed to separate the manufacturing operations to be transferred to Medline from those that will remain with Teleflex, which includes related workforce reductions (the &#8220;Respiratory divestiture plan&#8221;). The plan includes expanding certain of our existing locations to accommodate the transfer of capacity from the sites being transferred to Medline and replicating the manufacturing processes at alternate existing locations. We expect this plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2023. The following table provides a summary of our cost estimates by major type of expense associated with the Respiratory divestiture plan: \n\n##TABLE_START Total estimated amount expected to be incurred Plan expense estimates: (Dollars in millions) \n\nRestructuring charges (1) \n\n$ 5 million to $ 8 million \n\nRestructuring related charges (2) \n\n$ 19 million to $ 22 million \n\nTotal restructuring and restructuring related charges $ 24 million to $ 30 million \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Substantially all of the charges consist of employee termination benefit costs. \n\n(2) Consist of charges that are directly related to the Respiratory divestiture plan and principally constitute costs to transfer manufacturing operations to other locations and project management costs. Substantially all of the charges are expected to be recognized within costs of goods sold. \n\nWe expect substantially all of the restructuring and restructuring related charges will result in future cash outlays. Additionally, we expect to incur $ 22 million to $ 28 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred $ 8.9 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively, in pre-tax restructuring related charges, all of which were recognized in cost of goods sold. \n\nF-17 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have incurred net aggregate restructuring expenses related to the Respiratory divestiture plan of $ 3.3 million. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we have incurred net aggregate restructuring related charges in connection with the Respiratory divestiture plan of $ 12.2 million, which were primarily included in cost of goods sold . \n\n2019 Footprint realignment plan \n\nIn February 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations and related workforce reductions (the &#8220;2019 Footprint realignment plan\").

The maturity date of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility under the Credit Agreement is November 4, 2027. \n\nAt our option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.125 % to 2.00 % or at an alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (i) the &#8220;Prime Rate&#8221; in the U.S. last quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (ii) 0.50 % above the greater of the federal funds rate and the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar transactions denominated in Dollars and (iii) 1.00 % above the Term SOFR Rate for a one month interest period, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125 % to 1.00 %, in each case subject to adjustments based on our total net leverage ratio. Overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus 2.00 %. \n\nThe obligations to extend credit under the Credit Agreement are subject to customary conditions for transactions of this type. \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and thresholds, (a) place limitations on us and our subsidiaries regarding the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional liens, fundamental changes, dispositions of property, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, restrictive agreements, changes in lines of business and swap agreements, and (b) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with sanction laws and other laws and agreements, to deliver financial information and certain other information and give notice of certain events, to maintain their existence and good standing, to pay their other obligations, to permit the administrative agent and the lenders to inspect their books and property, to use the proceeds of the Credit Agreement only for certain permitted purposes and to provide collateral in the future. Subject to certain exceptions, we are required to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00. We are further required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00. \n\nWe capitalized transaction fees of $ 4.7 million, including underwriters' discounts and commissions, incurred in connection with the third amendment to the Credit Agreement.

In addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2023, we may, on one or more occasions, redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes redeemed, plus a &#8220;make-whole&#8221; premium and any accrued and unpaid interest.

Accordingly, the assets of the SPE are not available to satisfy the obligations of Teleflex or any of its subsidiaries. The SPE sells undivided interests in those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit for consideration of up to the maximum available capacity. This facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. The agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. An occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of its counterparty to terminate this facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants, and none of the termination events had occurred. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 75.0 million (the maximum amount available) of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility. \n\nFair value of long-term debt \n\nTo determine the fair value of our debt for which quoted prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow technique that incorporates a market interest yield curve with adjustments for duration, optionality and risk profile. Our implied credit rating is a factor in determining the market interest yield curve. The following table provides the fair value of our debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which is valued based on Level 2 inputs within the hierarchy used to measure fair value (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information): \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fair value of debt $ 1,674,232 &#160; $ 1,893,518 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDebt Maturities \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amounts of long-term debt, demand loans and debt under our securitization program that will mature during each of the next four years and thereafter were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 $ 87,500 &#160; 2024 12,500 &#160; 2025 25,000 &#160; 2026 25,000 &#160; 2027 and thereafter 1,573,250 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental cash flow information ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash interest paid $ 70,918 &#160; $ 73,598 &#160; $ 79,533 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 11 &#8212; Financial instruments \n\nForeign currency forward contracts \n\nWe use derivative instruments for risk management purposes. Foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flows hedges are used to manage foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are used to manage exposure related to near term foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We enter into the non-designated foreign currency forward contracts for periods consistent with the currency exposures, which generally approximate one month. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized losses related to non-designated foreign currency forward contracts of $ 3.0 million and $ 8.9 million, respectively. \n\nF-24 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nThe total notional amount for all open foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 184.8 million and $ 149.5 million, respectively. The total notional amount for all open non-designated foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 152.9 million and $ 161.2 million, respectively. All open foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2022 have durations of 12 months or less. \n\nCross-currency interest rate swaps \n\nDuring 2019, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements with five different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements, we have notionally exchanged $ 250 million at an annual interest rate of 4.8750 % for &#8364; 219.2 million at an annual interest rate of 2.4595 %. The swap agreements are designed as net investment hedges and expire on March 4, 2024. \n\nDuring 2018, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements with six different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreements, we have notionally exchanged $ 500 million at an annual interest rate of 4.625 % for &#8364; 433.9 million at an annual interest rate of 1.942 %. The swap agreements are designated as net investment hedges and expire on October 4, 2023. \n\nThe swap agreements described above require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements. We and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. \n\nThe cross-currency swaps are marked to market at each reporting date and any changes in fair value are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\") while the accrued interest is recognized in interest expense in the statement of operations. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange gains and losses recognized within AOCI and the interest benefit recognized within interest expense related to cross currency swap for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Foreign exchange gains $ 22,399 &#160; $ 34,849 &#160; Interest benefit 20,880 &#160; 19,296 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nBalance sheet presentation \n\nThe following table presents the locations in the consolidated balance sheets and fair value of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Asset derivatives: Designated foreign currency forward contracts $ 3,154 &#160; $ 1,957 &#160; Non-designated foreign currency forward contracts 41 &#160; 56 &#160; Cross-currency interest rate swap 48,503 &#160; 21,718 &#160; Prepaid expenses and other current assets 51,698 &#160; 23,731 &#160; Cross-currency interest rate swap 11,912 &#160; 9,560 &#160; Other assets 11,912 &#160; 9,560 &#160; Total asset derivatives $ 63,610 &#160; $ 33,291 &#160; Liability derivatives: Designated foreign currency forward contracts $ 983 &#160; $ 993 &#160; Non-designated foreign currency forward contracts 477 &#160; 147 &#160; Other current liabilities 1,460 &#160; 1,140 &#160; Total liability derivatives $ 1,460 &#160; $ 1,140 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 13 for information on the location and amount of gains and losses attributable to derivatives that were reclassified from AOCI to expense (income), net of tax. \n\nF-25 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there was no ineffectiveness related to our hedging derivatives. \n\nNote 12 &#8212; Fair value measurement \n\nFair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Under GAAP, there is a three-level hierarchy of the inputs (i.e., assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability) used to measure fair value. The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the entire fair value measurement. \n\nThe levels of inputs within the hierarchy used to measure fair value are as follows: \n\nLevel 1 &#8212; inputs to the fair value measurement that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\nLevel 2 &#8212; inputs to the fair value measurement that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. \n\nLevel 3 &#8212; inputs to the fair value measurement that are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. \n\nThe following tables provide information regarding our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Basis of fair value measurement December 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Investments in marketable securities $ 10,097 &#160; $ 10,097 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative assets 63,610 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 63,610 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivative liabilities 1,460 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,460 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration liabilities 44,022 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 44,022 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Basis of fair value measurement December 31, 2021 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Investments in marketable securities $ 19,186 &#160; $ 19,186 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative assets 33,291 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 33,291 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivative liabilities 1,140 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,140 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contingent consideration liabilities 9,814 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9,814 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThere were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nValuation Techniques \n\nOur financial assets valued based upon Level 1 inputs are comprised of investments in marketable securities held in trust, which are available to satisfy benefit obligations under Company benefit plans and other arrangements. The investment assets of the trust are valued using quoted market prices. \n\nOur financial assets and liabilities valued based upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements. We use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage foreign currency transaction exposure as well as exposure to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We measure the fair value of the foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap agreements by calculating the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities, based on quoted market prices, and taking into account the creditworthiness of the counterparties. \n\nOur financial liabilities valued based upon Level 3 inputs are comprised of contingent consideration arrangements pertaining to our acquisitions. \n\nF-26 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\nContingent consideration \n\nContingent consideration liabilities, which primarily consist of payment obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of revenue-based goals, but also can be based on other milestones such as regulatory approvals, are remeasured to fair value each reporting period using assumptions including revenue growth rates (based on internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans), revenue volatility, discount rates, probability of payment and projected payment dates. \n\nWe determine the fair value of certain contingent consideration liabilities using a Monte Carlo simulation (which involves a simulation of future revenues during the earn-out period using management's best estimates) or discounted cash flow analysis. Increases in projected revenues, estimated cash flows and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. Increases in the discount rates in periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements and decreases in the discount rates may have the opposite effect. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum amount we could be required to pay under the contingent consideration arrangements related to the Standard Bariatrics acquisition was $ 130.0 million. \n\nThe table below provides additional information regarding the valuation technique and inputs used in determining the fair value of our significant contingent consideration liabilities. \n\n##TABLE_START Contingent Consideration Liability Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Revenue-based Monte Carlo simulation Revenue volatility 31.8 &#160; % Risk free rate Cost of debt structure Projected year of payment 2024 - 2026 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides information regarding changes in our contingent consideration liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Contingent consideration 2022 2021 Beginning balance &#8211; January 1 $ 9,814 &#160; $ 36,633 &#160; Initial estimate upon acquisition 38,800 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Payments ( 6,975 ) ( 31,678 ) Revaluations and other adjustments 2,350 &#160; 4,895 &#160; Translation adjustment 33 &#160; ( 36 ) Ending balance &#8211; December 31 $ 44,022 &#160; $ 9,814 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNote 13 &#8212; Shareholders' equity \n\nOur authorized capital is comprised of 200 million common shares, $ 1 par value, and 500,000 preference shares.

The Plan provides for several different kinds of awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and other stock-based awards to directors, officers and key employees. Under the Plan, we are authorized to issue up to 5.3 million shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with special share counting rules in the Plan. Options granted under the Plan have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the common stock on the date of the grant. In 2022, we granted, under the Plan, non-qualified options to purchase 156,918 shares of common stock and granted restricted stock units relating to 85,780 shares of common stock under the Plan. We also granted performance share units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;), as described in the following paragraph. \n\nIn 2018, we began granting PSUs to specified senior managers. The PSUs are designed to provide further incentive to our senior management with respect to the achievement of our long term financial objectives. The PSU component of the equity incentive program is designed to provide shares of our common stock to the holder based upon our achievement of certain financial performance criteria during a designated performance period of three years . The number of shares to be awarded under the PSUs granted are subject to modification based upon our \n\nF-28 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued) \n\ntotal stockholder return relative to a designated group of public companies. Assuming target performance is achieved, a total of 25,131 shares of common stock would be issuable in respect of the PSUs granted and a maximum of 62,927 shares would be issuable in respect of such PSUs upon achievement of maximum performance levels.

It is not practical to determine the deferred income tax liability on these earnings if, in the future, they are remitted to the U.S. because the income tax liability to be incurred, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when remittance occurs. \n\nF-30 \n\nThe following table summarizes the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income from continuing operations before taxes: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 U.S. $ 164,151 &#160; $ 209,231 &#160; $ 233,034 &#160; Non-U.S. 281,768 &#160; 350,237 &#160; 124,698 &#160; $ 445,919 &#160; $ 559,468 &#160; $ 357,732 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nReconciliations between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Federal statutory rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % Tax effect of international items ( 4.6 ) ( 6.0 ) ( 5.3 ) Foreign merger - deferred taxes &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation ( 0.3 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 4.9 ) State taxes, net of federal benefit 3.4 &#160; 0.1 &#160; ( 0.3 ) Uncertain tax contingencies ( 0.4 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 0.5 ) Contingent consideration 0.1 &#160; 0.2 &#160; ( 2.2 ) Intellectual property impairment charge &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1.2 ) Research and development tax credit ( 1.0 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 1.1 ) Other, net 0.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.6 &#160; 18.6 &#160; % 13.3 &#160; % 6.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2022 was 18.6 % compared to 13.3 % for 2021. The effective income tax rate for 2022 reflects tax expense resulting from a deferred charge relating to the 2022 Restructuring Plan and from a U.S. law effective in 2022 requiring capitalization of certain research and development expenditures. The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflects tax expense associated with the Respiratory business divestiture. Additionally, the effective tax rates for both 2022 and 2021 reflect a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a tax benefit from research and development tax credits. \n\nWe are routinely subject to examinations by various taxing authorities. In conjunction with these examinations and as a regular practice, we establish and adjust reserves with respect to its uncertain tax positions to address developments related to those positions. We realized a net benefit of $ 2.0 million, $ 0.8 million and $ 1.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively, as a result of reducing our reserves with respect to uncertain tax positions, principally due to the expiration of a number of applicable statutes of limitations. \n\nF-31 \n\nThe following table summarizes significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Tax loss and credit carryforwards $ 110,857 &#160; $ 168,113 &#160; Lease Liabilities 32,339 &#160; 32,127 &#160; Pension 1,163 &#160; 350 &#160; Reserves and accruals 64,498 &#160; 64,421 &#160; Other 24,013 &#160; 4,379 &#160; Less: valuation allowances ( 91,531 ) ( 143,177 ) Total deferred tax assets 141,339 &#160; 126,213 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment 25,427 &#160; 24,479 &#160; Intangibles &#8212; stock acquisitions 379,298 &#160; 352,139 &#160; Unremitted non-U.S. earnings 67,833 &#160; 73,385 &#160; Lease Assets 32,339 &#160; 32,127 &#160; Other 18,926 &#160; 7,387 &#160; Total deferred tax liabilities 523,823 &#160; 489,517 &#160; Net deferred tax liability $ ( 382,484 ) $ ( 363,304 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nUnder the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward, subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 31, 2022, the tax effect of such carryforwards approximated $ 110.9 million. Of this amount, $ 16.0 million has no expiration date, $ 20.1 million expires after 2022 but before the end of 2027 and $ 74.8 million expires after 2027. A portion of these carryforwards consists of tax losses and credits obtained by us as a result of acquisitions; the utilization of these carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits a company&#8217;s ability to deduct prior net operating losses following a more than 50 percent change in ownership. It is not expected that the Section 382 limitation will prevent us ultimately from utilizing the applicable loss carryforwards. The determination of state net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the U.S. subsidiaries&#8217; taxable income or loss, the state&#8217;s proportion of each subsidiary's taxable net income and the application of state laws, which can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforward. \n\nThe valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $ 91.5 million and $ 143.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions : The following table is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 \n\n$ 6,105 &#160; $ 7,230 &#160; $ 7,561 &#160; Increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years \n\n215 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,286 &#160; Decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years \n\n( 761 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Reductions in unrecognized tax benefits due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations \n\n( 1,117 ) ( 956 ) ( 1,864 ) (Decrease) increase in unrecognized tax benefits due to foreign currency translation \n\n( 182 ) ( 169 ) 247 &#160; Balance at December 31 \n\n$ 4,260 &#160; $ 6,105 &#160; $ 7,230 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total liabilities associated with the unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate for continuing operations, were $ 2.7 million at December 31, 2022. \n\nF-32 \n\nWe accrue interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income, and the corresponding liability is included in the consolidated balance sheets. The net interest expense (benefit) and penalties reflected in income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $ 0.2 million and $( 0.2 ) million, respectively; for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $ 0.2 million and $( 0.3 ) million, respectively; and for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 0.2 million and $( 0.5 ) million, respectively. The liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for interest and penalties at December 31, 2022 were $ 0.6 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2021 were $ 0.8 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively. \n\nThe taxable years for which the applicable statute of limitations remains open by major tax jurisdictions are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Beginning Ending U.S. 2019 2022 Canada 2018 2022 China 2017 2022 Czech Republic 2019 2022 France 2019 2022 Germany 2011 2022 India 2002 2022 Ireland 2018 2022 Italy 2017 2022 Malaysia 2015 2022 Singapore 2018 2022 ##TABLE_END\n\nWe are routinely subject to income tax examinations by various taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2022, the most significant tax examinations in process were in Ireland, Germany and France. The date at which these examinations may be concluded and the ultimate outcome of the examinations are uncertain. As a result of the uncertain outcome of these ongoing examinations, future examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken could materially change from those recorded as liabilities at December 31, 2022. Due to the potential for resolution of certain examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next year by a range of zero to $ 2.0 million. \n\nSupplemental cash flow information ##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Income taxes paid, net of refunds $ 162,046 &#160; $ 108,609 &#160; $ 77,163 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 16 &#8212; Pension and other postretirement benefits \n\nWe have a number of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees&#8217; pay near retirement. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under non-U.S. plans are systematically provided for by depositing funds with trustees or by book reserves. As of December 31, 2022, no further benefits are being accrued under the U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans, other than certain postretirement benefit plans covering employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement. \n\nTeleflex and certain of our subsidiaries provide medical, dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners or their survivors.

The weighted average discount rates for U.S. pension plans and other benefit plans of 5.20 % and 5.13 %, respectively, were established by comparing the projection of expected benefit payments to the AA Above Median yield curve as of December 31, 2022. The expected benefit payments are discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield curve. For payments beyond 30 years, we extend the curve assuming that the discount rate derived in year 30 is extended to the end of the plan&#8217;s payment expectations. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments is established, we determine the single rate on the yield curve that, when applied to all obligations of the plan, will exactly match the previously determined present value. \n\nAs part of the evaluation of pension and other postretirement assumptions, we applied assumptions for mortality and healthcare cost trends that incorporate generational white and blue collar mortality trends. In determining its benefit obligations, we used generational tables that take into consideration increases in plan participant longevity. \n\nOur assumption for the expected return on plan assets is primarily based on the determination of an expected return for its current portfolio. This determination is made using assumptions for return and volatility of the portfolio. Asset class assumptions are set using a combination of empirical and forward-looking analysis. To the extent historical results have been affected by unsustainable trends or events, the effects of those trends are quantified and removed. We apply a variety of models for filtering historical data and isolating the fundamental characteristics of asset classes. These models provide empirical return estimates for each asset class, which are then reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of long term relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is finalized. The qualitative analysis is intended to provide an additional means for addressing the effect of unrealistic or unsustainable short-term valuations or trends, resulting in return levels and behavior we believe are more likely to prevail over long periods. Effective in 2022, we changed the expected return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans from 5.80 % to 7.40 % due to modifications to the investment strategy in order to reflect expected return assumptions based on recent capital market movements. \n\nF-36 \n\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans was $ 356.3 million and $ 474.1 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. All of the pension plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of their respective plan assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, with the exception of one foreign plan that had plan assets of $ 0.8 million and $ 2.0 million in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nOur investment objective is to achieve an enhanced long-term rate of return on plan assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the availability of benefits for participants. These investments are primarily comprised of equity and fixed income mutual funds. Our other investments are largely comprised of a hedge fund of funds and a structured credit fund. The equity funds are diversified in terms of domestic and international equity securities, as well as small, middle and large capitalization stocks. Our target allocation percentage is as follows: equity securities ( 26 %) and fixed-income securities ( 74 %). Equity funds are held for their expected return over inflation. Fixed-income funds are held for diversification relative to equities and as a partial hedge of interest rate risk with respect to plan liabilities. The other investments are held to further diversify assets within the plans and are designed to provide a mix of equity and bond like return with a bond like risk profile. The plans may also hold cash to meet liquidity requirements. Actual performance may not be consistent with the respective investment strategies. Investment risks and returns are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements and investment portfolio reviews to determine whether the asset allocation targets continue to represent an appropriate balance of expected risk and reward. \n\nThe following table provides the fair values of the pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 by asset category: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements Asset Category (a) Total Quoted Prices in \n\nActive Markets for \n\nIdentical Assets \n\n(Level 1) \n\nSignificant \n\nObservable \n\nInputs \n\n(Level 2) \n\nSignificant \n\nUnobservable \n\nInputs \n\n(Level 3) \n\nCash $ 769 &#160; $ 769 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Money market funds 13 &#160; 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Equity securities: Managed volatility (b) 46,721 &#160; 46,721 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. small/mid-cap equity (c) 6,054 &#160; 6,054 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; World equity (excluding U.S.) (d) 28,159 &#160; 28,159 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income securities: Intermediate duration fund (e) 105,865 &#160; 105,865 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long duration bond fund (f) 87,018 &#160; 87,018 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate bond fund (g) 6,092 &#160; 6,092 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Emerging markets debt fund (h) 6,284 &#160; 6,284 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate, government and foreign bonds 58,572 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 58,572 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Absolute return credit fund (i) 427 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 427 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Asset backed &#8211; home loans 153 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 153 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other types of investments: Structured credit (j) 29 &#160; 29 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Contract with insurance company (k) 11,114 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 11,114 &#160; Total investments at fair value $ 357,270 &#160; $ 287,004 &#160; $ 59,152 &#160; $ 11,114 &#160; Total $ 357,270 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-37 \n\nThe following table provides the fair values of the pension plan assets at December 31, 2021 by asset category: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fair Value Measurements Asset Category (a) Total Quoted Prices in \n\nActive Markets for \n\nIdentical Assets \n\n(Level 1) \n\nSignificant \n\nObservable \n\nInputs \n\n(Level 2) \n\nSignificant \n\nUnobservable \n\nInputs \n\n(Level 3) \n\nCash $ 923 &#160; $ 923 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Money market funds 6 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Equity securities: Managed volatility (b) 57,252 &#160; 57,252 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. small/mid-cap equity (c) 7,532 &#160; 7,532 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; World equity (excluding U.S.) (d) 34,287 &#160; 34,287 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income securities: Intermediate duration fund (e) 101,363 &#160; 101,363 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long duration bond fund (f) 171,919 &#160; 171,919 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate bond fund (g) 7,607 &#160; 7,607 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Emerging markets debt fund (h) 7,605 &#160; 7,605 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate, government and foreign bonds 50,599 &#160; 50,599 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Absolute return credit fund (i) 671 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 671 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Asset backed &#8211; home loans 208 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 208 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other types of investments: Contract with insurance company (k) 19,130 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 19,130 &#160; Other 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Total investments at fair value $ 459,105 &#160; $ 439,093 &#160; $ 879 &#160; $ 19,133 &#160; Investments measured at Net asset value (l) 10,688 &#160; Total $ 469,793 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Information on asset categories described in notes (b)-(l) is derived from prospectuses and other material provided by the respective funds comprising the respective asset categories. \n\n(b) This category comprises mutual funds that invest in securities of U.S. and non-U.S. companies of all capitalization ranges that exhibit relatively low volatility. \n\n(c) This category comprises a mutual fund that invests at least 80 % of its net assets in equity securities of small and mid-sized companies. The fund invests in common stocks or exchange traded funds holding common stock of U.S. companies with market capitalizations in the range of companies in the Russell 2500 Index. \n\n(d) This category comprises a mutual fund that invests at least 80 % of its net assets in equity securities of foreign companies. These securities may include common stocks, preferred stocks, warrants, exchange traded funds based on an international equity index, derivative instruments whose value is based on an international equity index and derivative instruments whose value is based on an underlying equity security or a basket of equity securities. The fund invests in securities of foreign issuers located in developed and emerging market countries. However, the fund will not invest more than 35 % of its assets in the common stocks or other equity securities of issuers located in emerging market countries. \n\n(e) This category comprises a mutual fund that invests in instruments or derivatives having economic characteristics similar to fixed income securities. The fund invests in investment grade fixed income instruments, including U.S. and foreign corporate obligations, fixed income securities issued by sovereigns or agencies in both developed and emerging foreign markets, debt obligations issued by governments or other municipalities, and securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government and its agencies. The fund will seek to maintain an effective average duration between three and ten years , and uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and credit default swaps, for the purpose of managing the overall duration and yield curve exposure of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio of fixed income securities. \n\n(f) This category comprises a mutual fund that invests in instruments or derivatives having economic characteristics similar to fixed income securities. The fund invests in investment grade fixed income instruments, including securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government and its agencies and instrumentalities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, exchange traded funds, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage-backed securities. The fund invests primarily in long duration government and corporate fixed income securities, and uses derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and Treasury futures contracts, for the purpose of managing the overall duration and yield curve exposure of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio of fixed income securities. \n\n(g) This category comprises funds that invest primarily in higher-yielding fixed income securities, including corporate bonds and debentures, convertible and preferred securities and zero coupon obligations. \n\nF-38 \n\n(h) This category comprises a mutual fund that invests at least 80 % of its net assets in fixed income securities of emerging market issuers, primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated debt of foreign governments, government-related and corporate issuers in emerging market countries and entities organized to restructure the debt of those issuers. \n\n(i) This category comprises a mutual fund that invests primarily in investment grade bonds and similar fixed income and floating rate securities. \n\n(j) This category comprises a fund that invests primarily in collateralized debt obligations and other structured credit vehicles and may include fixed income securities, loan participations, credit-linked notes, medium-term notes, pooled investment vehicles and derivative instruments. \n\n(k) This category comprises the asset established out of an agreement to purchase a bulk-annuity policy from an insurer to fully cover the liabilities for members of the pension plan. The asset value is based on the fair value of the contract as determined by the insurance company using inputs that are not observable. \n\n(l) This category comprises pooled institutional investments, primarily collective investment trusts. These funds are not listed on an exchange or traded in an active market and these investments are valued using their net asset value, which is generally based on the underlying asset values of the pooled investments held in the trusts. This category comprises the following funds: \n\n&#8226; a fund that invests primarily in collateralized debt obligations and other structured credit vehicles and may include fixed income securities, loan participations, credit-linked notes, medium-term notes, pooled investment vehicles and derivative instruments. \n\n&#8226; a hedge fund that invests in various other hedge funds. \n\n&#8226; funds that invest in underlying funds that acquire, manage, and dispose of real estate properties, with a focus on properties in the U.S. and the UK markets. \n\nOur contributions to U.S. and foreign pension plans during 2023 are expected to be approximately $ 1.4 million. Contributions to postretirement healthcare plans during 2023 are expected to be approximately $ 2.2 million. \n\nThe following table provides information about the expected benefit payments under its U.S. and foreign plans for each of the five succeeding years and the aggregate of the five years thereafter, net of the annual average Medicare Part D subsidy of approximately $ 0.1 million: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Other Benefits 2023 $ 23,081 &#160; $ 2,174 &#160; 2024 23,445 &#160; 2,014 &#160; 2025 23,934 &#160; 1,986 &#160; 2026 24,564 &#160; 1,783 &#160; 2027 24,940 &#160; 1,576 &#160; Years 2028 &#8212; 2032 127,978 &#160; 6,509 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe maintain a number of defined contribution savings plans covering eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. We partially match employee contributions. Costs related to these plans were $ 24.3 million, $ 23.2 million and $ 21.7 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nNote 17 &#8212; Commitments and contingent liabilities \n\nEnvironmental: We are subject to contingencies as a result of environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take further action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum substances by us or other parties. Much of this liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, often referred to as Superfund, the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar state laws. These laws require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where Company-generated waste was disposed. \n\nRemediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. The nature of these activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, the regulatory agencies involved and their enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of other potentially responsible parties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded $ 2.5 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, in accrued liabilities and $ 3.2 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively in other liabilities relating to these matters. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these liabilities, and if adverse changes in circumstances occur, potential liability may exceed the amount accrued as of December 31, 2022. The time frame over which the accrued amounts may be paid out, based on past history, is estimated to be 10 - 15 years. \n\nF-39 \n\nLegal matters: We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability, intellectual property, employment, environmental and other matters. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded accrued liabilities of $ 0.5 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively, in connection with such contingencies, representing our best estimate of the cost within the range of estimated possible losses that will be incurred to resolve these matters. \n\nIn August 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice through the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Georgia (collectively, the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) closed the Civil Investigative Demand (a &#8220;CID&#8221;) of one of our subsidiaries, NeoTract, Inc., under the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. &#167;3729. The CID, which began in 2020, related to the DOJ&#8217;s investigation of a single NeoTract customer and certain rebate programs offered to that customer in addition to communications and activities occurring both prior to our acquisition of NeoTract in October 2017 and thereafter. As part of the investigation the DOJ also opened an investigation into NeoTract&#8217;s operations broadly. \n\nBased on information currently available, advice of counsel, established reserves and other resources, we do not believe that the outcome of any outstanding litigation and claims is likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period incurred. \n\nOther: We have been subject to an investigation by Chinese authorities related to a technical error regarding our country of origin designation for certain products we imported into China. Had the error not been made, we would have been obligated to make increased tariff payments in late 2018 through the first quarter of 2021. In addition to the tariffs and related interest, the Chinese authorities may impose a penalty for the unpaid tariffs. \n\nTo date, we have remitted payment for the requested amounts of the increased tariffs, and we believe this to be the final action required to close the case. However, we have not received confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the case is closed and as a result, it remains possible that they may request payment for penalties and interest in the future. We believe the range of penalties could be between 30 % and 200 % of the increased tariff amount or between $ 3 million and $ 20 million. \n\nIn 2015, the Italian parliament enacted legislation that, among other things, imposed a &#8220;payback&#8221; measure on medical device companies that supply goods and services to the Italian National Healthcare System. Under the measure, companies are required to make payments to the Italian government if medical device expenditures in a given year exceed regional expenditure ceilings established for that year. The payment amounts are calculated based on the amount by which the regional ceilings for the given year were exceeded. Considerable uncertainty exists related to the enforceability of and implementation process for the payback law. In response to decrees issued by the Italian Ministry of Health, the various Italian regions issued invoices to medical device companies, including Teleflex, under the payback measure in the fourth quarter of 2022 seeking payment with respect to excess expenditures for the years 2015 through 2018. Following the issuance of the invoices, we and numerous other medical device companies filed appeals with the Italian administrative courts challenging the enforceability of the payback measure, which appeals remain pending. As of December 31, 2022, our reserve for this matter is $ 10.9 million, $ 2.6 million of which was recorded as a reduction of revenue for 2022. If the payback was to ultimately be enforced in its existing form, we estimate that we would be required to remit payments in excess of our current reserve of up to $ 23.0 million. \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Business segments and other information \n\nAn operating segment is a component (a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. We do not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information. \n\nWe have four reportable segments: Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), Asia (Asia Pacific) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer and Development Services). \n\nOur reportable segments, other than the OEM segment, design, manufacture and distribute medical devices primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and generally serve two end-markets: hospitals and \n\nF-40 \n\nhealthcare providers, and home health. The products of these segments are most widely used in the acute care setting for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and in general and specialty surgical applications. The OEM segment designs, manufactures and supplies devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers. \n\nThe following tables present our segment results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Americas $ 1,653,724 &#160; $ 1,659,309 &#160; $ 1,465,035 &#160; EMEA 558,373 &#160; 606,807 &#160; 584,859 &#160; Asia 306,320 &#160; 297,766 &#160; 267,016 &#160; OEM 272,624 &#160; 245,681 &#160; 220,246 &#160; Net revenues $ 2,791,041 &#160; $ 2,809,563 &#160; $ 2,537,156 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Americas $ 452,030 &#160; $ 424,225 &#160; $ 401,391 &#160; EMEA 42,465 &#160; 94,865 &#160; 81,348 &#160; Asia 82,786 &#160; 84,648 &#160; 51,238 &#160; OEM 65,379 &#160; 56,210 &#160; 44,852 &#160; Total segment operating profit (1) \n\n642,660 &#160; 659,948 &#160; 578,829 &#160; \n\nUnallocated expenses (2) \n\n( 142,935 ) ( 31,853 ) ( 155,761 ) Income from continuing operations before interest, loss on extinguishment of debt and taxes \n\n$ 499,725 &#160; $ 628,095 &#160; $ 423,068 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1 ) Segment operating profit includes segment net revenues from external customers reduced by its standard cost of goods sold, adjusted for fixed manufacturing cost absorption variances, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate expenses. Commencing on January 1, 2022, all corporate expenses are allocated amongst the segments in proportion to the respective amounts of net revenues. The change in the measure of segment operating profit does not impact period over period comparability because the change was immaterial. For the year ended December 31, 2021, corporate expenses were allocated among the segments in proportion to the respective amounts of one of several items (such as sales, numbers of employees, and amount of time spent), depending on the category of expense involved. \n\n(2) Unallocated expenses primarily include manufacturing variances other than fixed manufacturing cost absorption variances, restructuring and impairment charges and gain on sale of business. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Americas $ 162,898 &#160; $ 164,102 &#160; $ 151,111 &#160; EMEA 39,957 &#160; 45,022 &#160; 47,012 &#160; Asia 10,107 &#160; 11,140 &#160; 13,594 &#160; OEM 17,628 &#160; 17,098 &#160; 15,535 &#160; Consolidated depreciation and amortization $ 230,590 &#160; $ 237,362 &#160; $ 227,252 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-41 \n\nGeographic data \n\nThe following tables provide total net revenues and total net property, plant and equipment by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net revenues (based on selling location): U.S. $ 1,786,467 &#160; $ 1,769,488 &#160; $ 1,567,144 &#160; Europe 622,343 &#160; 665,000 &#160; 646,577 &#160; Asia Pacific 270,749 &#160; 263,022 &#160; 230,267 &#160; All other 111,482 &#160; 112,053 &#160; 93,168 &#160; $ 2,791,041 &#160; $ 2,809,563 &#160; $ 2,537,156 &#160; As of December 31, Net property, plant and equipment: 2022 2021 U.S. $ 193,618 &#160; $ 206,876 &#160; Malaysia 73,441 &#160; 72,541 &#160; Mexico 82,334 &#160; 69,471 &#160; All other 97,812 &#160; 94,870 &#160; $ 447,205 &#160; $ 443,758 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-42 \n\nTELEFLEX INCORPORATED \n\nSCHEDULE II &#8212; VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS \n\n(Dollars in thousands) \n\nALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS \n\n##TABLE_START Balance at \n\nBeginning of \n\nYear \n\n(Reversals) additions Charged to Income Accounts \n\nReceivable \n\nWrite-offs \n\nTranslation \n\nand Other \n\nBalance at \n\nEnd of \n\nYear \n\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 10,799 &#160; $ ( 786 ) $ ( 1,750 ) $ 299 &#160; $ 8,562 &#160; December 31, 2021 $ 12,875 &#160; $ 1,542 &#160; $ ( 3,001 ) $ ( 617 ) $ 10,799 &#160; December 31, 2020 $ 9,055 &#160; $ 3,798 &#160; $ ( 1,336 ) $ 1,358 &#160; $ 12,875 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE \n\n##TABLE_START Balance at \n\nBeginning of Year \n\nAdditions \n\nCharged to \n\nExpense \n\nReductions \n\nCredited to \n\nExpense \n\nTranslation \n\nand Other \n\nBalance at \n\nEnd of Year \n\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 143,177 &#160; $ 8,489 &#160; $ ( 59,520 ) $ ( 615 ) $ 91,531 &#160; December 31, 2021 $ 155,008 &#160; $ 7,770 &#160; $ ( 15,384 ) $ ( 4,217 ) $ 143,177 &#160; December 31, 2020 $ 119,233 &#160; $ 30,640 &#160; $ ( 59 ) $ 5,194 &#160; $ 155,008 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-43 \n\n"
