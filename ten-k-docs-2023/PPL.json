BUSINESS \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral \n\n&#160; \n\n(All Registrants) \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL, headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a utility holding company, incorporated in 1994 to serve as the holding company for the regulated utility that is now PPL Electric and pursue other business activities in the deregulated power sector. PPL, through its regulated utility subsidiaries, delivers electricity to customers in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia, and Rhode Island; delivers natural gas to customers in Kentucky and Rhode Island; and generates electricity from power plants in Kentucky. \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL's principal subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 are shown below (* denotes a Registrant). \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Corporation* &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Capital Funding \n\nProvides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Electric* \n\nEngages in the regulated transmission and distribution of electricity in Pennsylvania \n\n&#160; &#160; LKE \n\nA holding company that owns regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, LG&#38;E and KU \n\n&#160; &#160; RIE \n\nEngages in the regulated transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Rhode Island \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LG&#38;E* \n\nEngages in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky \n\n&#160; &#160; KU* \n\nEngages in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, primarily in Kentucky \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated Segment &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated Segment &#160; &#160; Rhode Island Regulated Segment &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to PPL, the other Registrants included in this filing are as follows. \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL Electric , headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a wholly owned subsidiary of PPL and a regulated public utility that is an electricity transmission and distribution service provider in eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric is subject to regulation as a public utility by the PAPUC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. PPL Electric delivers electricity in its Pennsylvania service area and provides electricity supply to retail customers in that area as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. PPL Electric was organized in 1920 as Pennsylvania Power &#38; Light Company. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a wholly owned subsidiary of LKE and a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&#38;E is subject to regulation as a public utility by the KPSC, and certain of its transmission activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. LG&#38;E was incorporated in 1913. \n\nKU, headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, is a wholly owned subsidiary of LKE and a regulated utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and Virginia. KU is subject to regulation as a public utility by the KPSC and the VSCC, and certain of its transmission and wholesale power activities are subject to the jurisdiction \n\nof the FERC under the Federal Power Act. KU serves its Kentucky customers under the KU name and its Virginia customers under the Old Dominion Power name. KU was incorporated in Kentucky in 1912 and in Virginia in 1991. \n\n&#160; \n\nSegment Information \n\n&#160; \n\n(PPL) \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: Kentucky Regulated, which primarily represents the results of LG&#38;E and KU, Pennsylvania Regulated, which primarily represents the results of PPL Electric, and Rhode Island Regulated, which primarily represents the results of RIE. \"Corporate and Other\" primarily includes financing and other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain non-recoverable costs resulting from commitments made to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island in conjunction with the acquisition of Narragansett Electric. \n\nA comparison of PPL's Regulated segments is shown below. \n\n##TABLE_START Kentucky Pennsylvania Rhode Island Regulated Regulated Regulated (a) For the year ended December 31, 2022: &#160; &#160; Operating Revenues (in billions) $ 3.8 $ 3.0 $ 1.0 Net Income (in millions) $ 507 $ 525 $ (44) Electricity delivered (GWh) 30,892 37,593 4,494 Natural gas delivered (Bcf) 31 &#8212; 14 At December 31, 2022: &#160; &#160; Regulatory Asset Base (in billions) (b) $ 11.7 $ 9.3 $ 3.2 Service area (in square miles) 8,000 10,000 1,200 Customers (in millions) 1.3 1.5 0.8 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) On May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric. The results of RIE are included in PPL&#8217;s Rhode Island Regulated segment. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(b) Represents capitalization for Kentucky Regulated, rate base for Pennsylvania Regulated and Rhode Island Regulated. The amount for Rhode Island Regulated excludes acquisition-related adjustments for non-earning assets. \n\nSee Note 2 to the Financial Statements for additional financial information by segment. \n\nBeginning on January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment will consist primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&#38;E and KU, as well as LG&#38;E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment also included the financing activities of LKE. The financing activity of LKE will be presented in Corporate and Other beginning on January 1, 2023. As a result of this change, beginning on January 1, 2023, PPL&#8217;s segments will consist of the regulated operations of Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and will exclude any incremental financing activities of holding companies, which Management believes is a more meaningful presentation as it provides information on the core regulated operations of PPL. \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nPPL Electric has two operating segments, distribution and transmission, which are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LG&#38;E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments. \n\nKentucky Regulated Segment (PPL) \n\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&#38;E and KU, as well as LG&#38;E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, the Kentucky Regulated segment includes certain financing and other costs at LKE. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, also Virginia. LG&#38;E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&#38;E provides electric service to approximately 433,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 334,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 541,000 customers in 77 counties in central, \n\nsoutheastern and western Kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information. \n\n&#160; \n\nFranchises and Licenses \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&#38;E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompetition \n\nThere are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LG&#38;E and KU. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LG&#38;E and KU, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated. \n\n&#160; \n\nAlternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&#38;E's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&#38;E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&#38;E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&#38;E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. \n\nPower Supply \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, LG&#38;E owned generating capacity of 2,760 MW and KU owned generating capacity of 4,775 MW. See \"Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment\" for a complete list of generating facilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe system capacity of LG&#38;E's and KU's owned generation is based upon several factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring 2022, LG&#38;E's and KU's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity: \n\n##TABLE_START GWh Fuel Source LG&#38;E KU Coal 10,488 13,880 Oil &#8212; 6 Gas 1,816 5,039 Hydro 278 61 Solar 8 12 Total (a) 12,590 18,998 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) This generation represents an increase for LG&#38;E of 5% and a decrease for KU of 1% from 2021 output. \n\nThe majority of LG&#38;E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. When LG&#38;E has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&#38;E and vice versa. \n\n&#160; \n\nDue to environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, as of December 31, 2022, LG&#38;E and KU have retired approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generation plants since 2010. \n\nLG&#38;E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW Solar Share facility to service a Solar Share program. The Solar Share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the Solar Share facility. Construction \n\ncommences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. Construction of five 500-kilowatt phases was completed as of December 31, 2022. LG&#38;E and KU continue to market the program and have started receiving subscriptions for the sixth 500-kilowatt phase. \n\nOn January 23, 2020, LG&#38;E and KU applied to the KPSC for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 MW of solar power in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&#38;E and KU would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility and resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. In 2020, the KPSC approved LG&#38;E&#8217;s and KU&#8217;s applications. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition. \n\nOn October 6, 2021, LG&#38;E and KU entered into an agreement to purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed 125 MW third-party solar generation facility in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&#38;E and KU would purchase output of the facility and resell power as renewable energy to certain large customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU do not anticipate that this agreement will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition. \n\nOn December 15, 2022, LG&#38;E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction of two 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine facilities, one at LG&#38;E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky and the other at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky, including on-site natural gas and electric transmission construction associated with those facilities and site compatibility certificates. LG&#38;E and KU also applied for a CPCN to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, and for a CPCN to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky. LG&#38;E and KU further applied for a CPCN to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station and for approval of their proposed 2024-2030 DSM programs. The plan includes adding 14 new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs, which would reduce LG&#38;E's and KU's overall need by approximately 100 MW each. Finally, LG&#38;E and KU requested a declaratory order to confirm that their entry into non-firm energy-only power-purchase agreements for the output of four solar photovoltaic facilities with a combined capacity of 637 MW does not require KPSC approval and that LG&#38;E and KU may recover the costs of the solar PPAs through their fuel adjustment clause mechanisms as previously approved for a prior solar PPA. LG&#38;E and KU plan to accrue AFUDC on the constructed NGCCs, solar facility in Mercer County, Kentucky and the battery energy storage system facility and have requested regulatory asset treatment to recover the financing costs of these projects. \n\nThe new NGCC would be jointly owned by LG&#38;E (31%) and KU (69%) and the solar units would be jointly owned by LG&#38;E (37%) and KU (63%), the battery storage unit would be owned by LG&#38;E, and the proposed PPA transactions and DSM programs would be entered into or conducted jointly by LG&#38;E and KU, consistent with LG&#38;E and KU's shared dispatch, cost allocation, tariff or other frameworks. \n\nThe filing also notes planned retirement dates for certain existing coal-fired generation units, including Mill Creek 1 (300 MW) in 2024 and E.W. Brown 3 (412 MW) in 2028 , and updates and advances the planned retirement dates for Mill Creek 2 (297 MW) to 2027 and Ghent 2 (486 MW) to 2028 . LG&#38;E and KU anticipate the recovery of associated retirement costs, including the remaining net book value, for these coal-fired generating units through the RAR or other rate mechanisms. \n\nThe KPSC accepted the filing as of January 6, 2023 and has indicated its intention to issue an order on all issues by November 6, 2023. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters. \n\nFuel Supply \n\n&#160; \n\nCoal and natural gas are expected to be the predominant fuels used by LG&#38;E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&#38;E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers. \n\n&#160; \n\nFuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by several factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues, high or low river level events, lock outages and other supplier or transporter operating or financial difficulties. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2027 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor their existing units, LG&#38;E and KU expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. LG&#38;E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail. \n\n&#160; \n\nTo enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&#38;E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity services with contracts of various durations through 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as two other simple cycle units at the Paddy's Run site. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility's connection to two interstate pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 through October 2024. The bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. \n\n(PPL and LG&#38;E) \n\nNatural Gas Distribution Supply \n\n&#160; \n\nFive underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used to provide natural gas service to LG&#38;E's firm sales customers. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&#38;E would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the cost of natural gas supply and pipeline transportation services are expected to be higher. At December 31, 2022, LG&#38;E had 10 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $68 million. LG&#38;E will continue work in 2023 on a multi-year project to retire one of its underground natural gas storage fields with a working natural gas capacity of 4 Bcf, with plans to complete by no later than 2025. \n\nLG&#38;E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&#38;E's natural gas customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&#38;E has a set of contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&#38;E between 2025 and 2028. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. LG&#38;E has two additional contracts with this same pipeline. One contract is for pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. The other contract is for pipeline capacity through 2028 for 30,000 MMBtu/day during the winter season. LG&#38;E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2030. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas. \n\n&#160; \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nTransmission \n\nLG&#38;E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization. \n\n&#160; \n\nRates \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC. LG&#38;E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff. \n\n&#160; \n\nLG&#38;E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&#38;E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky. \n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. \n\n&#160; \n\nKU's rates to two municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. \n\nSee \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on current rate proceedings and rate mechanisms. \n\nPennsylvania Regulated Segment (PPL) \n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of PPL Electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.5 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties within eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information. \n\nFranchise, Licenses and Other Regulations \n\nPPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies that it has succeeded, and as a result of certification by the PAPUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth. \n\nCompetition \n\nPursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PAPUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities. \n\nThe PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM. \n\nRates and Regulation \n\nTransmission \n\nPPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S. \n\nPJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff. \n\nAs a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric&#8217;s annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC&#8217;s Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Any change in the prior year PPL zonal peak load billing factor applied on January 1 of each year will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update is effective on June 1 of that same year. \n\nAs a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See \"PLR\" below. \n\nSee \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters. \n\nDistribution \n\nPPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PAPUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes. \n\nPennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electric distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PAPUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS. \n\nAct 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS. \n\nAct 11 authorizes the PAPUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013. \n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and legislative and regulatory matters. \n\nPLR \n\nThe Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PAPUC, to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PAPUC regulations. In 2022, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 37% of residential, 76% of small commercial and industrial and 95% of large commercial and industrial customers. \n\nPPL Electric&#8217;s electricity generation costs are established based upon the results of a competitive solicitation process. In December 2020, the PAPUC approved PPL Electric&#8217;s default service plan for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. Through December 31, 2022, four auctions of the plan were completed. This plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July. Through January 2023, four alternative energy credit solicitations have been completed. \n\nPursuant to the plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers who elect to take default service from PPL Electric. These solicitations contain a mix of products including 5-year block energy contracts for residential customers, 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers, and alternative energy credit contracts for residential, commercial and industrial customers. These contracts fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR. \n\nNumerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. \n\nRhode Island Regulated Segment (PPL) \n\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations and regulated distribution and sale of natural gas conducted by RIE. \n\nRIE is engaged in the regulated transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Rhode Island. RIE provides electric service to approximately 480,000 customers and natural gas service to approximately 270,000 customers. RIE's service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information. \n\nFranchises and Licenses \n\nRIE provides electricity delivery service and natural gas distribution service in its service territory pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by the Rhode Island state legislature, cities or municipalities or other entities. \n\nCompetition \n\nThere are currently no other electric or gas public utilities operating within the service area of RIE. \n\nAlternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact RIE's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. RIE's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact RIE's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass RIE's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems. \n\nRates and Regulation \n\nIn general, RIE operates subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, the RIPUC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. \n\nDistribution \n\nRIE owns and maintains electric and natural gas distribution networks in Rhode Island. Distribution revenues are primarily from the sale of electricity, natural gas, and related services to retail customers. Distribution sales are regulated by the RIPUC, which is responsible for approving the rates and other terms of services as part of the rate making process. Natural gas and electric distribution revenues are derived from the regulated sale and distribution of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within RIE&#8217;s service territory under the tariff rates. The tariff rates approved by the RIPUC are designed to recover the costs incurred by RIE for products and services provided, along with a return on investment. \n\nTransmission \n\nRIE owns an electric transmission system in Rhode Island. RIE&#8217;s transmission services are regulated by the FERC and coordinated with ISO &#8211; New England. Additionally, RIE makes available its transmission facilities to NEP, for operation and \n\ncontrol pursuant to an integrated facilities agreement, Service Agreement No. 23 (Integrated Facilities Agreement or IFA). These revenues arise under tariff/rate agreements. \n\nDeferral Mechanisms \n\nRIE records revenues in accordance with accounting principles for rate-regulated operations for arrangements between RIE and the applicable regulator. These include various deferral mechanisms such as capital trackers, energy efficiency programs, and other programs that qualify as Alternative Revenue Programs (ARPs). ARPs enable RIE to adjust rates in the future, in response to past activities or completed events. RIE&#8217;s electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to the RIE&#8217;s delivery rates, as a result of the reconciliation between allowed revenue and billed revenue. RIE also has other ARPs related to the achievement of certain objectives, demand side management initiatives, and certain other rate making mechanisms. RIE recognizes ARPs with a corresponding offset to a regulatory asset or liability account when the regulatory specified events or conditions have been met, when the amounts are determinable, and are probable of recovery (or payment) through future rate adjustments. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, all of RIE&#8217;s regulatory assets are authorized to earn a rate of return except $98 million of environmental response costs, $77 million of postretirement benefits and $61 million of net metering deferral costs. \n\nLast Resort Service \n\nRIE is required by the RIPUC and by statute to provide Last Resort Service. Last Resort Service is available to all customers who have not elected to receive their electric supply from a non-regulated power producer or any customer who, for any reason, has stopped receiving generation service from a non-regulated power producer. \n\nThe charge for Last Resort Service is the sum of the applicable Last Resort Service charges in addition to all appropriate Retail Delivery charges as stated in the applicable tariff. The monthly charge for Last Resort Service also includes the costs incurred by RIE to comply with the Renewable Energy Standard, established in Rhode Island General Laws Section 39-26-1 and the costs to comply with the RIPUC&#8217;s Rules Governing Energy Source Disclosure. The charge for Last Resort Service includes the administrative costs associated with the procurement of Last Resort Service, including an adjustment for uncollectible accounts as approved by the RIPUC. \n\nNumerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in RIE's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for RIE, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. \n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters. \n\nNatural Gas Distribution Supply \n\nTo meet the projected annual gas supply requirements of approximately 37 Bcf, RIE has a portfolio of gas supply arrangements of varying contractual terms and durations to provide service to its customers. These natural gas supply arrangements include contracts with natural gas producers and marketers that reflect market price signals. RIE also has firm pipeline and underground storage capacity contracts to support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its customers. To manage the winter peak requirements for RIE customers, RIE contracts for liquified natural gas (LNG) service and owns and operates certain LNG storage facilities. \n\nThe RIE gas supply portfolio includes contracts for firm transportation service with eleven interstate pipeline companies and natural gas storage operators. These contracts have various termination dates with certain contracts being subject to evergreen renewal provisions providing RIE with flexibility in managing its upstream resource portfolio. \n\nRIE has purchased and expects to continue to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions accessed by its pipeline capacity portfolio in South Texas, East Texas, and Louisiana, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas. RIE expects to purchase certain natural gas supplies that originate in Canada and from regional LNG import terminals. \n\nCorporate and Other (PPL) \n\nPPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs. \n\nPPL Capital Funding provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL utilizes PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in financings, in addition to continued direct financing by certain operating subsidiaries. \n\nUnlike those of PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisition of LKE and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated Segment. Prior to 2021, the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, were assigned to the relevant segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. Beginning in 2021, corporate level financing costs are no longer allocated to the reportable segments. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters, and may be subject to different and more stringent such laws and regulations enacted in the future. The EPA and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters have issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. Due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. The Biden administration is currently undertaking changes in a wide range of environmental programs. \n\nSee &#8220;Legal Matters&#8221; in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. \n\nLG&#38;E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon KPSC review. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG&#38;E and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery at the discretion of the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. Because PPL Electric and RIE do not own any generating plants, they have less exposure to related environmental compliance costs. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities. \n\nAir \n\nNAAQS (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nApplicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the NAAQS, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. States that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish \"good neighbor\" state implementation plans. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional EPA program known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). \n\nThe Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to establish and review NAAQS for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change, but the EPA subsequently announced reconsideration of those decisions in June 2021. On January 6, 2023, the EPA released a pre-publication proposed revision to the particulate matter standard that would lower the primary standard for fine particulates to a level to be determined after review of additional public comments. Depending on the final standard adopted by the EPA, the EPA could potentially designate Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the new particulate matter standard and require additional particulate matter reductions from sources including LG&#38;E&#8217;s Mill Creek Station. PPL, LG&#38;E, and KU are unable to predict the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards. \n\nIn January 2018, the EPA designated Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015 ozone standard. In 2020 and 2021, LG&#38;E entered into agreements with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District for temporary nitrogen oxide emission limits at LG&#38;E's Mill Creek Station during those years to facilitate compliance with the ozone standard. In October 2022, Jefferson County was &#8220;bumped up&#8221; to the moderate nonattainment classification, but the Louisville Air Pollution Control District has applied to the EPA for Jefferson County to be redesignated as in attainment. Although PPL and LG&#38;E expect Jefferson County to be redesignated as in attainment, if the EPA declines to issue such a redesignation, Jefferson County could be subject to additional requirements including requirements for installation of reasonably available control technology on coal-fired generating units. Compliance with such requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions. PPL and LG&#38;E are unable to determine the impact on operations until certain compliance determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky. \n\nIn March 2021, the EPA released final revisions to the CSAPR, aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS and providing for reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years from sources in 12 states, including Kentucky. Additionally, the EPA reversed its previous approval of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan with respect to these requirements. In February 2022, the EPA Administrator released a proposed Federal Implementation Plan under the Good Neighbor provisions of the Clean Air Act providing for significant additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions for compliance with the revised 2015 ozone NAAQS. The proposed reductions in Kentucky state-wide nitrogen oxide budgets are scheduled to commence in 2023, with the largest reductions planned for 2026, based on the installation time frame for certain selective catalytic reduction controls, subject to future specific allowance calculations. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU are currently assessing the potential impact of the proposed Good Neighbor Plan revisions on operations. The current and proposed rules provide for reduced availability of nitrogen oxide allowances that have historically permitted operational flexibility for fossil units and could potentially result in constraints that may require implementation of additional emission controls or accelerate implementation of lower emission generation technologies. Pursuant to the President&#8217;s executive order, the EPA is currently reviewing its previous determinations made in December 2020 to retain the existing NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter without change, including a pre-publication proposed revision that was released by the EPA on January 6, 2023. \n\nPPL, LG&#38;E, and KU are unable to predict future emission reductions that may be required by future federal rules or state implementation actions. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, inclusive of retirements, the costs of which PPL, LG&#38;E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery. \n\nClimate Change (All Registrants) \n\nThe Biden administration is undertaking wide-ranging efforts to address climate change. Recent government actions and policy developments, including the President&#8217;s announced goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035, could have far-reaching impacts on PPL&#8217;s business operations, products, and services. On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that provisions of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, premised on generation shifting from coal-fired plants to lower emitting natural gas-fired plants and renewables, exceeded the authority granted to the EPA under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has announced that it plans on issuing new greenhouse gas rules in the future. It is uncertain how the Supreme Court ruling may impact future EPA rulemaking. All of these developments are preliminary or ongoing in nature and the Registrants cannot predict the final outcome or ultimate impact on operations. \n\nPPL has adopted a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which PPL expects will include continuing to retire coal-fired generation and investing in research and innovation that will help to achieve this goal, while maintaining reliable and affordable energy in our service territories. The net-zero goal relates to direct and indirect carbon emissions consistent with Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance and referenced by the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership. Through 2021, PPL reduced carbon emissions nearly 60% from 2010 levels and is targeting a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035 and an 80% reduction by 2040. \n\nPPL is also aware of the various risks associated with climate change, including increased frequency and severity of severe weather. To address these risks, PPL continues to work to advance grid modernization and improve the Company's equipment to help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and improve reliability. \n\nWater/Waste \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nClean Water Act \n\nRegulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects that impact \"Waters of the United States\". Many other requirements relate to power plant operations, including the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, and standards intended to protect aquatic organisms that become trapped at or pulled through cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. These requirements could impose significant costs for LG&#38;E and KU, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery. \n\nClean Water Act Jurisdiction \n\nEnvironmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the \"Waters of the United States,\" including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. PPL, LG&#38;E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. Any associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of future regulatory proceedings and litigation. \n\nWaters of the United States \n\nPPL, LG&#38;E, and KU are subject to permitting and mitigation requirements for certain construction activities that impact \"Waters of the United States.\" On April 21, 2020, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule revising the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" to exclude jurisdiction over certain surface waters. On August 30, 2021, a U.S. District Court in Arizona vacated and remanded the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed to repeal the rule and restore the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" that was in place prior to 2015. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case raising the issue of the appropriate scope of the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act. On January 18, 2023, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final revision to the rule broadening the definition of Waters of the United States and reverting to the pre-2015 regulatory framework. Although the broader definition incorporates additional water bodies, any resulting permitting, construction, and operational expenses are expected to be immaterial and subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of current or future litigation or regulatory proceedings, but do not expect a material impact on operations. \n\nSuperfund and Other Remediation \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nFrom time to time, PPL's subsidiaries undertake testing, monitoring or remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary to comply with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. \n\nFuture cleanup or remediation work at sites not yet identified may result in significant additional costs for the Registrants. Insurance policies maintained by LG&#38;E and KU may be available to cover certain of the costs or other obligations related to these matters, but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured. \n\nSee &#8220;Legal Matters&#8221; in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nSEASONALITY \n\nThe demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. As a result, the Registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when unpredictable weather conditions make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n\nSee \"Financial Condition\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for this information. \n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS \n\nSee \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information concerning projected capital expenditure requirements for 2023 through 2025. See \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information concerning the potential impact on capital expenditures from environmental matters. \n\nHUMAN CAPITAL \n\nPPL, together with its subsidiaries, is committed to fostering an exceptional workplace for employees. PPL pledges to enable the success of its current and future workforce by cultivating a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture, fostering professional development, encouraging employee engagement, and ensuring a safe and healthy work environment. Matters related to these priorities and corporate culture are overseen by PPL's senior management, which provides updates to the PPL Board of Directors (the Board). Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also periodically reviews and assesses the Company's strategy for human capital management. PPL's investment in the success of our workforce is embodied in the following areas with dedicated leadership and Board oversight: \n\n&#8226; Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) - Foster an inclusive, respectful and diverse workplace through a comprehensive DEI strategy and commitments. PPL created a chief diversity officer position in 2022 to lead the company's DEI efforts. Senior management reviews demographic metrics, DEI objectives and associated programs semi-annually. The Board also receives periodic updates from senior management on PPL's DEI strategy and initiatives. \n\n&#8226; Employee engagement - Create a workplace that fosters an engaged, high-quality workforce. PPL's operating companies regularly conduct assessments related to employee engagement, safety and culture. Senior management reviews corporate culture with the Board annually. \n\n&#8226; Professional development - Invest in our current and future workforce through training and development, succession planning and creation of a pipeline for internal advancement. Senior management reviews succession planning with the Compensation Committee of the Board on an annual basis. \n\n&#8226; Comprehensive benefits - In addition to challenging careers and competitive salaries, PPL offers competitive benefits programs to attract and retain talent and support employees' well-being. PPL offers competitive vacation time, expanded leave for new parents, retirement programs, and internal and external development opportunities, including tuition reimbursement offerings for undergraduate and certain graduate degrees. Senior management conducts annual benchmarking of employee compensation and benefits. \n\n&#8226; Safety and Compliance - PPL is also committed to maintaining an ethical and safe workplace culture. Additional steps to ensure Board oversight in these areas include: \n\n&#8226; Safety &#8211; PPL carries out programs focused on health and safety, including emergency preparedness, vehicle safety and accident prevention. Employees receive safety training and are encouraged to share, implement, and follow best practices. Senior management receives monthly safety data updates to determine whether additional safety measures should be implemented. The Board annually reviews the company's safety programs and results. The Board is also immediately engaged in the event of a fatality. \n\n&#8226; Compliance &#8211; The Corporate Compliance Committee, including senior executives, meets quarterly to discuss metrics and other matters related to the compliance and ethics culture. Among the items discussed are \n\nstatistics regarding Ethics Helpline reports and employee concerns. This information is also reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board quarterly. \n\nPPL will continue to engage with employees and to assess these priorities as we work to best position individuals and the company for future success. PPL had a turnover rate of 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Looking forward, we will maintain our strong focus on workforce planning to address future talent needs. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, PPL and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees and employees represented by labor unions: \n\n##TABLE_START Total Full-Time Employees Number of Union Employees Percentage of Total Workforce PPL 6,527 2,411 37 % PPL Electric 1,382 913 66 % LG&#38;E 964 618 64 % KU 807 109 14 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nIn March 2022, members of the IBEW Local 1600 ratified a new five-year labor agreement with PPL and PPL Electric. The contract covers over 900 employees and was effective May 16, 2022. The current five-year agreement expires in May 2027. The terms of the new labor agreement are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial results of PPL or PPL Electric. \n\n(PPL and KU) \n\nLabor agreement negotiations with the KU USW are expected to commence in July 2023. The current contract covers over 40 employees and is scheduled to expire in August 2023. \n\n(PPL and LG&#38;E) \n\nLabor agreement negotiations with the LG&#38;E IBEW are expected to commence in October 2023. The current contract covers over 600 employees and is scheduled to expire in November 2023. \n\nCYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT \n\nThe Registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. The frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. PPL has adopted a variety of measures to monitor and address cyber-related risks and continues to implement and explore additional cybersecurity measures. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of PPL's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at Board of Directors meetings. PPL's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within PPL's enterprise risk management processes. PPL's Vice President and Chief Security Officer (CSO), who reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. In addition, among other things, the CSO and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the Registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, conduct incident response exercises and internal ethical phishing campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior and foster a culture of security. The cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. In addition, PPL has a formal internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis. \n\nIn addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, PPL's Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC and approved by the FERC to protect grid security and reliability. LG&#38;E is also subject to certain security directives related to cybersecurity issued by the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Transportation Security Administration in 2021. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on these directives. Finally, PPL purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the Registrants' businesses or operations or that PPL's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident. \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\nPPL's Internet website is www.pplweb.com. Under the Investors heading of that website, PPL provides access to SEC filings of the Registrants (including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(d) or 15(d)) free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC. The information contained on, or available through, PPL's Internet website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference into this report.

Our businesses, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. In addition, this report also contains forward-looking and other statements about our businesses that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. See \"Forward-Looking Information,\" \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information concerning the risks described below and for other risks, uncertainties and factors that could impact our businesses and financial results. \n\nAs used in this Item 1A., the terms \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" generally refer to PPL and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, or PPL Electric and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Pennsylvania Regulated segment discussion, LKE and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Kentucky Regulated segment discussion, and RIE and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole within the Rhode Island Regulated segment discussion. \n\nOrder of Subsection Presentation \n\nA. Risks Related to Registrant Holding Company \n\nB. Risks Related to Regulated Utility Operations \n\nC. Risks Specific to Kentucky Regulated Segment \n\nD. Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment \n\nE. Risks Specific to Rhode Island Regulated Segment \n\nF. Risks Related to All Segments \n\n(PPL) \n\nA. Risk Related to Registrant Holding Company \n\nPPL is a holding company and its cash flows and ability to meet its obligations with respect to indebtedness and under guarantees, and its ability to pay dividends, largely depends on the financial performance of its respective subsidiaries and, as a result, is effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of those subsidiaries. \n\nPPL is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through subsidiaries. Substantially all of the consolidated assets of PPL are held by its subsidiaries. Accordingly, PPL's cash flows and ability to meet debt and guaranty obligations, as well as PPL's ability to pay dividends, are largely dependent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, advances or repayment of loans and advances. The subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends or distributions to their parents or to make funds available for such a payment. The ability of PPL's subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions in the future will depend on the subsidiaries' future earnings and cash flows and the needs of their businesses, and may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding debt and other creditors, as well as any contractual or legal restrictions in effect at such time, including the requirements of state corporate law applicable to payment of dividends and distributions, and regulatory requirements, including restrictions on the ability of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E, KU, and RIE to pay dividends under Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act. \n\nBecause PPL is a holding company, its debt and guaranty obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries. Although certain agreements to which certain subsidiaries are parties limit their ability to incur additional indebtedness, PPL and its subsidiaries retain the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness and other liabilities. Therefore, PPL's rights and the rights of its creditors, including rights of debt holders, to participate in the assets of any of its subsidiaries, in the event that such a subsidiary is liquidated or reorganized, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors. \n\n( All Registrants ) \n\nB. Risks Related to Regulated Utility Operations \n\nOur regulated utility businesses face many of the same risks, in addition to those risks that are unique to each of the Kentucky Regulated, Pennsylvania Regulated and Rhode Island Regulated segments. Set forth below are risk factors common to the regulated segments, followed by sections identifying separately the risks specific to each of these segments. \n\nOur profitability is highly dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn an adequate return on our capital investments. Regulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged. \n\nThe rates we charge our utility customers must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC and RIPUC. Although rate regulation is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full or timely recovery of our costs or an adequate return on our capital investments. Federal or state agencies, intervenors and other permitted parties may challenge our current or future rate requests, structures or mechanisms, and ultimately reduce, alter or limit the rates we receive. Although our rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a base year or on future projected costs, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. Our regulated utility businesses are subject to substantial capital expenditure requirements over the next several years, which may require rate increase requests to the regulators in the future. If our costs are not adequately recovered through rates, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nOur utility businesses are subject to significant and complex governmental regulation. \n\nIn addition to regulating the rates we charge, various federal and state regulatory authorities regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; the terms and conditions of our service and operations; \n\n&#8226; financial and capital structure matters; \n\n&#8226; siting, construction and operation of facilities; \n\n&#8226; mandatory reliability and safety standards under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other standards of conduct; \n\n&#8226; accounting, depreciation and cost allocation methodologies; \n\n&#8226; tax matters; \n\n&#8226; affiliate transactions; \n\n&#8226; acquisition and disposal of utility assets and issuance of securities; and \n\n&#8226; various other matters, including energy efficiency. \n\nSuch regulations or changes thereto may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures and failure to comply could result in sanctions or possible penalties which may not be recoverable from customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur regulated businesses undertake significant capital projects and these activities are subject to unforeseen costs, delays or failures, as well as risk of inadequate recovery of resulting costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe regulated utility businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in energy generation (in the case of LG&#38;E and KU) and transmission, distribution and other infrastructure projects, such as projects for environmental compliance and system reliability. The completion of these projects without delays or cost overruns is subject to risks in many areas, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; approval, licensing and permitting; \n\n&#8226; land acquisition and the availability of suitable land; \n\n&#8226; skilled labor or equipment shortages; \n\n&#8226; construction problems or delays, including disputes with third-party intervenors; \n\n&#8226; increases in commodity prices or labor rates; \n\n&#8226; potential supply chain disruptions or delays; and \n\n&#8226; contractor performance. \n\nFailure to complete our capital projects on schedule or on budget, or at all, could adversely affect our financial performance, operations and future growth if such expenditures are not granted rate recovery by our regulators. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are or may be subject to costs of remediation of environmental contamination at facilities owned or operated by our former subsidiaries. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may be subject to liability for the costs of environmental remediation of property now or formerly owned by us with respect to substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned \n\nor operated the facilities. We also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of manufactured gas for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. Remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant operations are one source of such costs. Citizen groups or others may bring litigation regarding environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. We cannot predict the amount and timing of future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although they could be material. \n\nC. Risks Specific to Kentucky Regulated Segment \n\n&#160; \n\n( PPL, LG&#38;E and KU ) \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to financial, operational, regulatory and other risks related to requirements, developments and uncertainties in environmental regulation, including those affecting coal-fired generation facilities. \n\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to LG&#38;E's and KU's generation supply, including its air emissions, water discharges (ELGs) and the management of hazardous and solid wastes (CCRs), among other business-related activities, and the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted and could be material. In addition, our costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws, regulations or similar rules are expanded or changed as the environmental standards governing LG&#38;E&#8217;s and KU&#8217;s businesses, particularly as applicable to coal-fired generation and related activities, continue to be subject to uncertainties due to rulemaking and other regulatory developments, legislative activities and litigation, administrative and permit challenges. The Biden administration is considering a wide range of potential policies, executive orders, rules, legislation and other initiatives in connection with climate change that may affect these costs. Depending on the extent, frequency and timing of such changes, LG&#38;E and KU may face higher risks of unsuccessful implementation of environmental-related business plans, noncompliance with applicable environmental rules, delayed or incomplete rate recovery or increased costs of implementation. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or forfeitures, operational changes, permit limitations or other restrictions. At some of our older generating facilities it may be uneconomic for us to install necessary pollution control equipment, which could cause us to retire those units. Market prices for energy and capacity also affect this cost-effectiveness analysis. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of our key suppliers or customers, such as coal producers, power producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs of their products and demand for our services. \n\n( PPL and LG&#38;E ) \n\nWe are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding natural gas supply infrastructure. \n\nA natural gas pipeline explosion or associated incident could have a significant impact on LG&#38;E&#8217;s natural gas operations or result in significant damages and penalties that could have an adverse impact on LG&#38;E&#8217;s financial position and results of operations. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration enforces regulations that govern the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties against LG&#38;E. These regulations require, among other things, that pipeline operators take certain measures with respect to pipeline integrity. Depending on the results of integrity tests and other integrity program activities, we could incur significant and unexpected costs to perform remedial activities on our natural gas infrastructure to ensure our continued safe and reliable operation. Recent pipeline incidents in the U.S. have also led to the introduction of proposed rules and possible federal legislative actions which could impose restrictions on LG&#38;E&#8217;s operations or require more stringent testing to ensure pipeline integrity. Implementation of these regulations could increase our costs to comply with pipeline integrity and safety regulations. \n\nD. Risks Specific to Pennsylvania Regulated Segment \n\n( PPL and PPL Electric ) \n\nWe face competition for transmission projects, which could adversely affect our rate base growth. \n\nFERC Order 1000, issued in July 2011, establishes certain procedural and substantive requirements relating to participation, cost allocation and non-incumbent developer aspects of regional and inter-regional electricity transmission planning activities. The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to \n\ncompetition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM. Increased competition can result in lower rate base growth. \n\nWe could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to Pennsylvania Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs. \n\nPPL Electric is subject to Act 129, which contains requirements for energy efficiency and conservation programs and for the use of smart metering technology, imposes PLR electricity supply procurement rules, provides remedies for market misconduct, and made changes to the existing Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard. The law also requires electric utilities to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. Utilities not meeting these Act 129 requirements are subject to significant penalties that cannot be recovered in rates. Numerous factors outside of our control could prevent compliance with these requirements and result in penalties to us. \n\nE. Risks Related to the Rhode Island Regulated Segment \n\n( PPL ) \n\nPPL may not realize the anticipated benefits of the RIE acquisition, which could materially adversely affect PPL's business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nPPL may not realize the anticipated financial and operational benefits from the RIE acquisition if the business is not integrated in an efficient and effective manner or if integration takes longer than anticipated. These integration risks include potential difficulties in conversion of systems and information, difficulties in harmonizing inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices and policies, disruption from the acquisition making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers, and diversion of management time and attention to integration and other acquisition-related issues. In addition, PPL has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs in connection with the integration, and additional unanticipated costs may arise. No assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits from the acquisition will be achieved or, if achieved, the timing of their achievement. These risks and their consequences could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could have a material adverse effect on PPL's business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to operational, regulatory and other risks regarding natural gas supply infrastructure in Rhode Island. \n\nA natural gas pipeline explosion or associated incident could have a significant impact on RIE's natural gas operations or result in significant damages and penalties that could have an adverse impact on RIE&#8217;s financial position and results of operations. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration enforces regulations that govern the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties against RIE. These regulations require, among other things, that pipeline operators take certain measures with respect to pipeline integrity. Depending on the results of integrity tests and other integrity program activities, we could incur significant and unexpected costs to perform remedial activities on our natural gas infrastructure to ensure our continued safe and reliable operation. \n\nF. Risks Related to All Segments \n\n( All Registrants ) \n\nCOVID-19 or other pandemics and resultant impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect our business. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. and global economies. While its impact is waning in many respects, a resurgence, new variant or other pandemic and related remediation efforts could present challenges to businesses, communities, workforces, markets and supply chains. The COVID-19 virus continues to pose risks to the health and welfare of the Registrants&#8217; customers, employees, contractors and suppliers, and to affect the conduct of their business. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a contributing factor to certain supply chain shortages that have created risks of potential equipment and fuel supply chain disruptions. These issues may continue or become worse, as a result of pandemics and other factors, and Registrants may be forced to rely on a larger pool of suppliers, which could pose operational risks. These factors have the potential to materially and adversely affect the Registrants&#8217; business and operations, especially if they are exacerbated by a resurgence or other pandemics. At this time, the Registrants&#8217; cannot predict the extent to which these or other pandemic-related factors may affect their business, earnings or other financial results. \n\nOur business operations are continually subject to cyber-based security and data integrity risks from vulnerabilities related to our IT systems, operational technology infrastructure and supply chain relationships. \n\nNumerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. The operation of our transmission and distribution systems, including gas distribution systems, as well as our generation plants, are all reliant on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, subject to the risk that these systems could be the target of disruptive actions by terrorists, nation state actors or criminals or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. Attacks may come through ransomware, software updates or patches, use of opensource software, firmware that hackers can manipulate to include malicious codes for exploitation at a later date, or the compromising of hardware by bad actors, creating serious risks to our security, the security of our customers' information, and potentially to our ability to provide power. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information lost or stolen, causing us to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to our reputation. Threats to our systems and operations continue to emerge as new ways to compromise components of our systems or networks are developed. Additionally, cybersecurity risks also threaten our supply chains, including aspects that are not under our control, such as the incorporation of opensource software in systems or software that we use, that despite our efforts do not meet our current security standards. \n\nIn addition, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, users, owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including PPL Electric, LG&#38;E, KU and RIE, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by the FERC. As an operator of natural gas distribution systems, LG&#38;E is also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation and is also subject to certain security directives related to cybersecurity issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in 2021. The TSA has determined that LG&#38;E is critical, while RIE has not been notified of this distinction and is therefore not currently subject to the security directives. Failure to comply with these standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of the standards. \n\nWe are subject to risks associated with federal and state tax laws and regulations. \n\nChanges in tax law as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. We are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, property, gross receipts, franchise, sales and use, employment-related and other taxes. We also estimate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and tax credits. Dependent upon the revenue needs of the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate, various tax and fee increases may be proposed or considered. We cannot predict changes in tax law or regulation or the effect of any such changes on our businesses. Any such changes could increase tax expense and could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. The effects of the TCJA have been reflected in our financial statements, and we continue to evaluate the application of the law in calculating income tax expense. \n\nIncreases in electricity prices and/or a weak economy can lead to changes in legislative and regulatory policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency, conservation and distributed generation or self-generation, which may adversely impact our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnergy consumption is significantly impacted by overall levels of economic activity and costs of energy supplies. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to changes in or the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable energy sources, and distributed or self-generation by customers. This focus on conservation, energy efficiency and self-generation may result in a decline in electricity demand, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nWe could be negatively affected by rising interest rates, downgrades to our credit ratings, adverse credit market conditions or other negative developments in our ability to access capital markets. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur businesses are capital-intensive and, in the ordinary course of business, we are reliant upon adequate long-term and short-term financing to fund our significant capital expenditures, debt service and operating needs. As a result, we are sensitive to developments in interest rates, credit rating considerations, insurance, security or collateral requirements, market liquidity and credit availability and refinancing opportunities necessary or advisable to respond to credit market changes. Changes in these conditions could result in increased costs and decreased availability of credit. In addition, certain sources of debt and equity capital have expressed reservations about investing in companies that rely on fossil fuels. If sources of our capital are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. \n\n&#160; \n\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining our credit facilities and any new debt. \n\n&#160; \n\nCredit ratings assigned by Moody's and S&#38;P to our businesses and their financial obligations have a significant impact on the cost of capital incurred by our businesses. A ratings downgrade could increase our short-term borrowing costs and negatively affect our ability to fund liquidity needs and access new long-term debt at acceptable interest rates. See \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ratings Triggers\" for additional information on the financial impact of a downgrade in our credit ratings. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur operating revenues could fluctuate on a seasonal basis, especially as a result of extreme weather conditions, including conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur businesses are subject to seasonal demand cycles. For example, in some markets demand for, and market prices of, electricity peak during hot summer months, while in other markets such peaks occur in cold winter months. As a result, our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis if weather conditions diverge adversely from seasonal norms. The effects of climate change may accelerate or magnify fluctuations in our operating results. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating expenses could be affected by weather conditions, including storms, as well as by significant man-made or accidental disturbances, including terrorism or natural disasters. \n\n&#160; \n\nWeather and other factors can significantly affect our profitability or operations by causing outages, damaging infrastructure and requiring significant repair costs. Storm outages and damage often directly decrease revenues and increase expenses, due to reduced usage and restoration costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change. \n\n&#160; \n\nClimate change may produce changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and thus may impact consumer demand for electricity. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the cost of electricity, particularly power generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could have a depressive effect on regional economies. Reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas -- both generally and specific to certain industries and consumers accustomed to previously lower cost power -- could reduce demand for the power we generate, market and deliver. Also, demand for our energy-related services could be similarly lowered by consumers' preferences or market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage. The Registrants' responses to such climate-related risks include compliance with evolving governmental policy and developing and implementing strategies designed to meet net zero carbon emissions goals, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings or investigations related to our businesses in which we are periodically involved. An unfavorable outcome or determination in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation and periodically are subject to state and federal investigations arising out of our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in Item 1. Business and \"Regulatory Matters\" in Note 7 to the Financial Statements and in \"Legal Matters\" and \"Regulatory Issues\" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, nor can we reasonably estimate the costs or liabilities that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case. \n\n&#160; \n\nSignificant increases in our operation and maintenance expenses, including health care and pension costs, could adversely affect our future earnings and liquidity. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe continually focus on limiting and reducing our operation and maintenance expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures in our operations. Increased costs of materials and labor may result from general inflation, increased regulatory requirements (especially in respect of environmental regulations), the need for higher-cost expertise in the workforce or other factors. In addition, pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of health care and pension benefits to certain current employees and retirees. These benefits give rise to significant expenses. Due to general inflation with respect to such costs, the aging demographics of our workforce and other \n\nfactors, we have experienced significant health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken and expect to take to require employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs with respect to the defined benefit pension plans for our employees and retirees. The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations, costs and liabilities is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, most of which relate to factors beyond our control. These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, health care cost trends, inflation rates, benefit improvements, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs and cash contribution requirements to fund these benefits could increase significantly. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may incur liabilities in connection with divestitures. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn connection with various divestitures, and certain other transactions, we have indemnified or guaranteed parties against certain liabilities. These indemnities and guarantees relate, among other things, to liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we or our subsidiaries operated a divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we or our subsidiaries made commitments in connection with a divestiture. See \"Guarantees and Other Assurances\" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements. \n\nWe are subject to liability risks relating to our generation, transmission and distribution operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe conduct of our physical and commercial operations subjects us to many risks, including risks of potential physical injury, property damage or other financial liability, caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors, contractual or financial counterparties and other third parties. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur facilities may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses and decrease our revenues and have an adverse effect on our financial performance. \n\n&#160; \n\nOperation of power plants, transmission and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other assets and activities subjects us to a variety of risks, including the breakdown or failure of equipment, accidents, security breaches, viruses or outages affecting information technology systems, labor disputes, obsolescence, delivery/transportation problems and disruptions of fuel supply and performance below expected levels. These events may impact our ability to conduct our businesses efficiently and lead to increased costs, expenses or losses. Operation of our delivery systems below our expectations may result in lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance costs, which may not be recoverable from customers. Planned and unplanned outages at our power plants may require us to purchase power at then-current market prices to satisfy our commitments or, in the alternative, pay penalties and damages for failure to satisfy them. \n\n&#160; \n\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks, we do not carry insurance for all of these risks and no assurance can be given that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us in the event losses occur. \n\nWe are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals. \n\nWe are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from governmental agencies. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which a permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. In addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, may result in delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our power delivery and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. Although various regulators routinely renew existing licenses, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure; failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions; local community, political or other opposition; and executive, legislative or regulatory action. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur cost or inability to obtain and comply with the permits and approvals required for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows. In addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. In addition to the possible imposition of fines in such cases, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in pollution control technology and obtain additional operating permits or approvals, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nWar, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nWar, terrorist attacks and unrest have caused and may continue to cause instability in the world's financial and commercial markets. In addition, unrest could lead to acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, and acts of terrorism could be directed against companies such as ours. Armed conflicts and terrorism and their effects on us or our markets may significantly affect our business and results of operations in the future. In addition, we may incur increased costs for security, including additional physical plant security and security personnel or increased capability following a terrorist incident. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to counterparty performance, credit or other risk in the provision of goods or services to us, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or conduct business activities. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe purchase from a variety of suppliers energy, capacity, fuel, natural gas, transmission service and certain commodities used in the physical operation of our businesses, as well as goods or services, including information technology rights and services, used in the administration of our businesses. Delivery of these goods and services is dependent on the continuing operational performance and financial viability of our contractual counterparties and also the markets, infrastructure or third parties they use to provide such goods and services to us. As a result, we are subject to risks of disruptions, curtailments or increased costs in the operation of our businesses if such goods or services are unavailable or become subject to price spikes or if a counterparty fails to perform. Such disruptions could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities or deliver services and collect revenues, which could result in lower sales and/or higher costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. The performance of coal markets and producers may be the subject of increased counterparty risk to LG&#38;E and KU currently due to weaknesses in such markets and suppliers. The coal industry is subject to increasing competitive pressures from natural gas markets, political pressures and new or more stringent environmental regulation, including regulation of combustion byproducts and water inputs or discharges. \n\nWe are subject to the risk that our workforce and its knowledge base may become depleted in coming years. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe experience attrition due primarily to retiring employees, with the risk that critical knowledge will be lost and that it may be difficult to replace departed personnel, and to attract and retain new personnel, with appropriate skills and experience. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

Combined Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022. \n\nOverview \n\n&#160; \n\nFor a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see \"Item 1. Business.\" \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL operates four fully regulated high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Rhode Island, constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes. \n\nPPL's strategy, which is supported by the other Registrants and subsidiaries, is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in areas that we serve. \n\nCentral to PPL's and the other Registrants' strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms \n\nand other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, in addition to FERC formula rates, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Rhode Island, FERC formula rates, the gas cost adjustment, net metering, infrastructure, safety and reliability (ISR) and revenue decoupling mechanisms and other rate adjustment mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. \n\nFinancial and Operational Developments \n\n(PPL) \n\nAcquisition of Narragansett Electric \n\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S. (the Acquisition). The consideration for the Acquisition consisted of approximately $3.8 billion in cash and approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt assumed through the transaction. The $3.8 billion total cash consideration paid was funded with proceeds from PPL's 2021 sale of its U.K. utility business. The Acquisition resulted in $1.6 billion of goodwill. The results of RIE are reported in PPL's Rhode Island Regulated segment. \n\nThe acquisition of Narragansett Electric was deemed an asset acquisition for federal and state income tax purposes, as a result of PPL and National Grid making a tax election under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) &#167;338(h)(10). Accordingly, the tax bases of substantially all of the assets acquired were increased to fair market value, which equaled net book value, thereby eliminating the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. This election resulted in tax goodwill that will be amortized for tax purposes over 15 years. \n\nSee Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nSale of Safari Holdings \n\nOn September 29, 2022, PPL signed a definitive agreement to sell all of Safari Holdings membership interests to Aspen Power Services, LLC. On November 1, 2022, PPL completed the sale (the Transaction). \n\nA loss on sale of $60 million ($46 million net of tax benefit) was recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the Transaction, $53 million of goodwill previously presented in the Corporate and Other category for segment reporting purposes was written-off. \n\nSee Note 9 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nPennsylvania State Tax Reform (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nOn July 8, 2022, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Pennsylvania House Bill 1342 (H.B. 1342). Among other changes to the state tax code, the bill reduces the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% beginning January 1, 2023, and further reduces the rate annually by half a percentage point until the rate reaches 4.99% in 2031. \n\nGAAP requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary book-to-tax differences are expected to be realized or settled. In 2022, PPL and PPL Electric recorded an increase in regulatory liabilities of $270 million for the remeasurement of regulated accumulated deferred tax balances and a deferred tax benefit of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, associated with the remeasurement of non-regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances. The amounts recorded are estimates that will be updated quarterly to reflect revised forecast, actual activity, and applicable orders from regulatory authorities. \n\nInflation Reduction Act (All Registrants) \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA enacted a new 15% corporate \"book minimum tax,\" which is based on adjusted GAAP pre-tax income and is only applicable to corporations whose pre-tax income exceeds a certain threshold. PPL continues to assess the impacts of the IRA on the financial statements of PPL and the other Registrants and will monitor guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury in the future. PPL does not anticipate a material cash tax impact in the foreseeable future. In addition, the IRA enacted numerous new tax credits, largely associated with renewable energy. PPL continues to assess the applicability of these provisions to PPL and its subsidiaries. \n\nRegulatory Requirements \n\n( All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations. \n\nEnvironmental Considerations for Coal-Fired Generation (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nThe businesses of LG&#38;E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See Notes 7, 14 and 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LG&#38;E and KU to retire approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2010 . As part of the long-term generation planning process, LG&#38;E and KU evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets. \n\nAs a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, LG&#38;E anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the Mill Creek Plant and KU anticipates retiring one coal-fired unit at each of the E.W. Brown and Ghent plants. Mill Creek Unit 1, with 300 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2, with 297 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2027. E.W. Brown Unit 3, with 412 MW of capacity, and Ghent Unit 2, with 486 MW of capacity, are expected to be retired in 2028. LG&#38;E and KU anticipate the recovery of associated retirement costs, including the remaining net book value, for these coal-fired generating units through the RAR or other rate mechanisms. \n\nCPCN (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nOn December 15, 2022, LG&#38;E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction of two 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine facilities, one at LG&#38;E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky and the other at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky, including on-site natural gas and electric transmission construction associated with those facilities and site compatibility certificates. LG&#38;E and KU also applied for a CPCN to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, and for a CPCN to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky. LG&#38;E and KU further applied for a CPCN to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station and for approval of their proposed 2024-2030 DSM programs. The plan includes adding 14 new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs, which would reduce LG&#38;E's and KU's overall need by approximately 100 MW each. Finally, LG&#38;E and KU requested a declaratory order to confirm that their entry into non-firm energy-only power-purchase agreements for the output of four solar photovoltaic facilities with a combined capacity of 637 MW does not require KPSC approval and that LG&#38;E and KU may recover the costs of the solar PPAs through their fuel adjustment clause mechanisms as previously approved for a prior solar PPA. LG&#38;E and KU plan to accrue AFUDC on the constructed NGCCs, solar facility in Mercer County, Kentucky and the battery energy storage system facility and have requested regulatory asset treatment to recover the financing costs of these projects. \n\nThe plan is consistent with PPL's goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The replacement strategy, if approved, would reduce the carbon intensity of LG&#38;E and KU's generation fleet and result in nearly a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions from existing levels. \n\nThe KPSC accepted the filing as of January 6, 2023 and has indicated its intention to issue an order on all issues by November 6, 2023. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters. \n\nFERC Transmission Rate Filing (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nIn 2018, LG&#38;E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&#38;E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&#38;E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&#38;E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&#38;E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&#38;E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&#38;E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&#38;E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&#38;E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. On August 4, 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings at the FERC on remand. LG&#38;E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms and such rate recovery would be anticipated to be adjusted consistent with potential changes or terminations of the waivers and credits, as such become effective. \n\nRate Case Proceedings (KU) \n\nOn August 31, 2021, KU filed a request with the VSCC for an annual increase in Virginia base electricity rates of approximately $12 million, based on an authorized 10.4% return on equity. On March 11, 2022, KU, certain intervenors and the VSCC staff reached a partial stipulation and recommendation agreement providing KU with an increase in base electricity rates of approximately $7 million based on an authorized 9.4% return on equity. A hearing on open issues occurred on March 17, 2022. On May 25, 2022, the VSCC issued an order approving the proposed agreement. New rates became effective June 1, 2022. \n\nResults of Operations \n\n(PPL) \n\n&#160; \n\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing 2022 with 2021. The \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Adjusted Gross Margins\" discussions for PPL provide a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Adjusted Gross Margins,\" and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n\n&#160; \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\n&#160; \n\nA \"Statement of Income Analysis\" is presented separately for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. The \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2022 with 2021.

The loss on extinguishment activity included the tender premium, make-whole premiums, accrued interest, bank fees and unamortized fees, hedges and discounts. \n\n(b) The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to PPL Capital Funding debt that was redeemed in June and July 2021, partially offset by increases at LG&#38;E, KU and PPL Electric. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Change in pre-tax income $ 128 Valuation allowance adjustments (a) (39) Impact of U.K. Finance Acts (b) (383) Other (8) Total $ (302) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) In 2021, PPL recorded a $31 million state deferred tax benefit on a net operating loss and an offsetting valuation allowance in connection with the loss on extinguishment associated with a tender offer to purchase and retire PPL Capital Funding's outstanding Senior Notes. \n\n(b) The U.K. Finance Act 2021, formally enacted on June 10, 2021, increased the U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The primary impact of the corporation tax rate increase was an increase in deferred tax liabilities of the U.K. utility business, which was sold on June 14, 2021, and a corresponding deferred tax expense of $383 million, which was recognized in continuing operations in 2021. \n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. \n\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) \n\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) decreased $1,540 million in 2022 compared with 2021. The decrease was due to the completion of the U.K. utility business in the second quarter of 2021. See \"Discontinued Operations\" in Note 9 to the Financial Statements for summarized results of the operations of the U.K. utility business. \n\nSegment Earnings \n\nPPL's Net Income (Loss) by reportable segments was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Change &#160; 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Kentucky Regulated $ 507 $ 468 $ 39 Pennsylvania Regulated 525 445 80 Rhode Island Regulated (a) (44) &#8212; (44) Corporate and Other (b) (274) (895) 621 Discontinued Operations (a) 42 (1,498) 1,540 Net Income (Loss) $ 756 $ (1,480) $ 2,236 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(b) Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. \n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations \n\nManagement utilizes \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. \n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as: \n\n&#8226; Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. \n\n&#8226; Impairment charges. \n\n&#8226; Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. \n\n&#8226; Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. \n\n&#8226; Significant losses on early extinguishment of debt. \n\n&#8226; Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations. \n\nPPL's Earnings from Ongoing Operations by reportable segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\", \"Depreciation\" and \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations. \n\n&#8226; \"Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance,\" (which are primarily Act 129, Storm Damage and Universal Service program costs), \"Depreciation\" (which is primarily related to the Act 129 Smart Meter program) and \"Taxes, other than income,\" (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's electricity delivery operations. \n\n&#8226; \"Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Rhode Island Regulated segment, as well as the Rhode Island Regulated segment's \n\ndistribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance\" (which are primarily regional network transmission service, energy efficiency and storm cost related) and \"Taxes, other than income\" (which is primarily gross earnings tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from Rhode Island Regulated segment's electricity and gas delivery operations. \n\nThese measures are not intended to replace \"Operating Income,\" which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget. \n\nChanges in Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nThe following table shows Adjusted Gross Margins by PPL's reportable segment and by component, as applicable, for the year ended December 31 as well as the changes between periods. The factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Change &#160; 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Kentucky Regulated &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins $ 2,460 $ 2,255 $ 205 Pennsylvania Regulated &#160; &#160; &#160; Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins &#160; &#160; &#160; Distribution $ 962 $ 915 $ 47 Transmission 739 674 65 Total Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins $ 1,701 $ 1,589 $ 112 Rhode Island Regulated Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins $ 441 $ &#8212; $ 441 ##TABLE_END\n\nKentucky Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nKentucky Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher base rates of $105 million, environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates of $66 million and higher sales volumes primarily due to weather of $29 million. \n\nThe increase in base rates was the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2021. The environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates were the result of the transfer of certain ECR and GLT expenses into base rates as a result of the 2020 Kentucky rate case. This transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the ECR and GLT programs being excluded from margins for all twelve months in 2022 compared to six months in 2021. \n\nPennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nDistribution \n\nDistribution Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher sales volumes of $17 million which included favorable weather of $11 million. Late payment charges increased $10 million as a result of not charging late payment fees for much of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. TCJA margins increased $11 million due to lower taxable income associated with the mechanism. Merchant Function Charge, which is added to the PTC rates to offset uncollectible expenses, increased by $8 million largely due to the energy price increases. \n\nTransmission \n\nTransmission Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $29 million increase as a result of a higher annual PPL zonal peak load billing factor in 2022 and $38 million of returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability. \n\nRhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nRhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins increased for 2022 compared with 2021, due to the acquisition of Narragansett Electric on May 25, 2022. \n\nReconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Operating Income\" for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins (a) Other (b) Operating Income (c) Operating Revenues $ 3,811 $ 3,030 $ 1,088 $ (27) $ 7,902 Operating Expenses Fuel 931 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 931 Energy purchases 273 1,048 365 &#8212; 1,686 Other operation and maintenance 92 111 249 1,946 2,398 Depreciation 53 28 &#8212; 1,100 1,181 Taxes, other than income 2 142 33 155 332 Total Operating Expenses 1,351 1,329 647 3,201 6,528 Total $ 2,460 $ 1,701 $ 441 $ (3,228) $ 1,374 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 2021 Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins Other (b) Operating Income (c) Operating Revenues $ 3,348 $ 2,430 $ &#8212; $ 5 $ 5,783 Operating Expenses Fuel 710 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 710 Energy purchases 186 566 &#8212; &#8212; 752 Other operation and maintenance 88 111 &#8212; 1,409 1,608 Depreciation 105 52 &#8212; 925 1,082 Taxes, other than income 4 112 &#8212; 91 207 Total Operating Expenses 1,093 841 &#8212; 2,425 4,359 Total $ 2,255 $ 1,589 $ &#8212; $ (2,420) $ 1,424 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Operating revenue excludes a $50 million customer bill credit to all electric and natural gas distribution customers that was treated as a special item.

The decrease in non-cash charges was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the impairment of solar panels in 2021, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits. \n\n&#8226; The $414 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory liabilities (primarily due to PPL Electric&#8217;s transmission formula rate return on equity reduction and the timing of rate recovery mechanisms) and a decrease in other current assets, partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather and rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in accounts receivable (primarily due to pricing) and an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to timing). \n\n&#8226; The $41 million decrease in defined benefit plan funding was primarily due to a decrease in contribution to pension plans in 2022, as PPL's defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements. \n\n&#8226; The $16 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was driven by an increase in non-current liabilities (primarily related to an increase in ARO expenditures and an increase in non-current regulatory liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accrued pension and postretirement obligations). \n\n(PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric's cash provided by operating activities in 2022 decreased $212 million compared with 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net income increased $80 million between the periods and included a decrease in non-cash components of $21 million. The decrease in non-cash components was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense (primarily related to a decrease in software and computer hardware depreciation as a result of end-of-life retirements). \n\n&#8226; The $262 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory liabilities (primarily due to refunds to customers related to the transmission formula rate return on equity reduction), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather and rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in accounts payable (due to timing) and an increase in accounts receivable (due to pricing). \n\n&#8226; The $21 million of activity in defined benefit plan funding was primarily due to a decrease in contribution to its pension plans in 2022, as PPL Electric's defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements. \n\n&#8226; The $30 million decrease in cash provided by other operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in non-current assets (primarily related to cloud computing and a decrease in medical claim payments). \n\n(LG&#38;E) \n\nLG&#38;E's cash provided by operating activities in 2022 increased $85 million compared with 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net income increased $23 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of $11 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements and higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2021), partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax expense (primarily due to book versus tax plant timing differences). \n\n&#8226; Cash from changes in working capital increased by $50 million. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory assets and liabilities, net (primarily due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in accounts payable to affiliates and other current liabilities (primarily due to timing of payments), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather and higher commodity costs). \n\n(KU) \n\nKU's cash provided by operating activities in 2022 increased $53 million compared with 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net income increased $26 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of $32 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements and higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2021). \n\n&#8226; Cash from changes in working capital increased $2 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, an increase in accounts payable with affiliates, an increase in taxes payable and a decrease in other current liabilities (primarily due to timing of payments) and other insignificant changes, partially offset by an increase in fuels, materials and supplies (primarily due to higher commodity costs and the accumulation of inventory for upcoming transmission and distribution products) and an increase in unbilled revenues and accounts receivable (primarily due to weather and higher commodity costs). \n\nInvesting Activities \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU 2022 vs. 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change - Cash Provided (Used): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Expenditures for PP&#38;E $ (182) $ 12 $ 95 $ 13 Proceeds from sale of Safari Holdings, net of cash divested 146 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Proceeds from sale of U.K. utility business, net of cash divested (10,560) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Acquisition of Narragansett Electric, net of cash acquired (3,660) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Notes receivable from affiliate &#8212; 998 &#8212; &#8212; Other investing activities 38 3 11 (4) Total $ (14,218) $ 1,013 $ 106 $ 9 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor PPL, in 2022 compared with 2021, the increase in expenditures was due to expenditures at RIE, partially offset by a decrease in expenditures at LG&#38;E.

See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(g) Represents construction commitments, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. \n\nDividends/Distributions \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts intended to maintain a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. In November 2022, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 3, 2023, at 22.50 cents per share (equivalent to $0.90 per annum). On February 17, 2023, PPL announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 24.00 cents per share, payable April 3, 2023, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2023. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. \n\nSubject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067. At December 31, 2022, no interest payments were deferred. \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nFrom time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends, distributions or return capital, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries. \n\nPurchase or Redemption of Debt Securities \n\nThe Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material. \n\nRating Agency Actions \n\nMoody's and S&#38;P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. \n\nA credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&#38;P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. \n\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing \n\ncosts and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt. \n\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Senior Unsecured &#160; Senior Secured &#160; Commercial Paper Issuer &#160; Moody's &#160; S&#38;P &#160; Moody's &#160; S&#38;P &#160; Moody's &#160; S&#38;P PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Capital Funding &#160; Baa1 &#160; BBB+ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; P-2 &#160; A-2 Rhode Island Energy A3 A- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL and PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A1 &#160; A+ &#160; P-2 &#160; A-1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL, LG&#38;E and KU &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LG&#38;E &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A1 &#160; A &#160; P-2 &#160; A-2 KU &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A1 &#160; A &#160; P-2 &#160; A-2 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries. \n\n(PPL) \n\nIn June 2022, Moody&#8217;s affirmed its commercial paper rating for PPL Capital Funding and upgraded the following ratings with a \n\nstable outlook: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer rating from Baa2 to Baa1 for PPL; \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured rating from Baa2 to Baa1 for PPL Capital Funding; \n\n&#8226; the junior subordinated rating from Baa3 to Baa2 for PPL Capital Funding; and \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured bank credit facility rating from Baa2 to Baa1 for PPL Capital Funding. \n\nIn June 2022, Moody&#8217;s upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer rating from Baa1 to A3 for RIE; \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured rating from Baa1 to A3 for RIE; and \n\n&#8226; the preferred stock rating from Baa3 to Baa2 for RIE. \n\nIn June 2022, S&#38;P upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer rating from BBB+ to A- for RIE; \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured rating from BBB+ to A- for RIE; and \n\n&#8226; the preferred stock rating from BBB- to BBB for RIE. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nIn May 2022, S&#38;P upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook for PPL Electric: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer credit rating from A- to A; \n\n&#8226; the issue-level senior secured rating from A to A+; and \n\n&#8226; the short-term and commercial paper ratings from A-2 to A-1. \n\nRatings Triggers (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nVarious derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, and interest rate instruments, contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LG&#38;E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of \"Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features,\" including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL and LG&#38;E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2022. \n\nGuarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL) \n\nPPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees. \n\nOther Contingent Obligations (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nRisk Management \n\nMarket Risk \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nSee Notes 1, 17 and 18 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. \n\nThe forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. \n\nThe following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) Maturities Ranging Through Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) PPL and LG&#38;E &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Economic hedges &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest rate swaps (c) $ 64 $ (7) $ (1) 2033 $ 64 $ (19) $ (1) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes accrued interest, if applicable. \n\n(b) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates. \n\n(c) Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. \n\nThe Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt and interest expense at December 31 is shown below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 10% Adverse Movement in Rates on Fair Value of Debt 10% Adverse Movement in Rates on Interest Expense For Floating Exposure &#160; 2022 2021 2022 2021 PPL $ 495 $ 394 $ 16 $ &#8212; PPL Electric 178 164 6 &#8212; LG&#38;E 84 74 3 &#8212; KU 127 115 2 &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nPPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below. \n\n&#8226; PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. \n\n&#8226; LG&#38;E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&#38;E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs. \n\n&#8226; RIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC- approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices. \n\nVolumetric Risk \n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below. \n\n&#8226; PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases. \n\n&#8226; RIE is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates. \n\nDefined Benefit Plans - Equity Securities Price Risk \n\nSee \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits\" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets. \n\nCredit Risk \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance. \n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below. \n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E or KU defaults on its contractual obligation, those Registrants would need to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities. \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit. \n\n&#160; \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nRelated Party Transactions \n\nThe Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions, Development and Divestitures \n\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures, and development projects. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on acquisition and divestiture activity. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the Registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. \n\nSee \"Legal Matters\" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental claims. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. See \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information. \n\nSustainability \n\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of &#8220;sustainability&#8221;, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer&#8217;s business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8217;34 Act), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their &#8217;34 Act reports. In March 2022, the SEC proposed broad-based climate disclosure requirements for public companies. The proposed rule would require public companies to disclose direct and indirect GHG emissions, strategic insights, and certain financial implications in public disclosures. The proposed rulemaking elicited significant debate and comment. While a final rulemaking is currently expected to be issued in the spring of 2023, PPL cannot predict the final legal requirements or when the requirements will be effective. \n\nAs has been PPL&#8217;s practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants&#8217; financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric and gas utility industry. Additionally, PPL consults widely used reporting frameworks for discrete sustainability topics, including corporate political contributions and climate-related issues.

The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them. \n\nDefined Benefits \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 7 and 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits. \n\nA summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Plan Sponsor PPL &#160; PPL Electric &#160; LG&#38;E &#160; KU PPL Services S &#160; P &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LKE &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; P &#160; P ##TABLE_END\n\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on \n\nestimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are: \n\n&#8226; Discount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio. \n\n&#8226; Expected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption. \n\n&#8226; Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices. \n\nSee Note 12 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. \n\nThe following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption. \n\n##TABLE_START Increase (Decrease) Actuarial assumption &#160; Discount Rate (0.25 %) Expected Return on Plan Assets (0.25 %) Rate of Compensation Increase 0.25 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Increase) Decrease Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Actuarial assumption Defined Benefit Asset Defined Benefit Liabilities AOCI (pre-tax) Net Regulatory Assets Defined Benefit Costs PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rates $ (14) $ (78) $ 27 $ 65 $ 14 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a n/a n/a 10 Rate of compensation increase (2) (6) 2 6 3 PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rates &#8212; (34) &#8212; 34 5 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a &#8212; n/a 4 Rate of compensation increase &#8212; (2) &#8212; 2 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LG&#38;E Discount rates (9) 1 n/a 10 2 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a n/a n/a 1 Rate of compensation increase (1) &#8212; n/a 1 &#8212; KU Discount rates (8) 1 n/a 9 2 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a n/a n/a 1 Rate of compensation increase (1) &#8212; n/a 1 &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants) \n\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. \n\nAdditionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. \n\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. When evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such factors is also considered by management. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. \n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities (All Registrants) \n\nPPL Electric, LG&#38;E, KU and RIE are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. \n\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets. \n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices. \n\nPrice Risk Management (PPL) \n\nSee \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above. \n\nGoodwill Impairment (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting units of PPL include the Kentucky Regulated reporting unit, the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting unit, and the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. LG&#38;E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments and each are single reporting units. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. \n\nManagement assigned the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the RIE acquisition to the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, RIE goodwill of $1,586 million was assigned to PPL&#8217;s reporting units. To determine the amount of the RIE goodwill assigned to PPL&#8217;s reporting units, management calculated the fair value of the Kentucky Regulated and the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit to those reporting units. The difference in the fair values of the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit from the acquisition of RIE represents goodwill derived from the acquisition and was assigned to the respective reporting units. The remainder of the RIE goodwill was assigned to the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. \n\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. \n\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually LG&#38;E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances by reportable segment at December 31, 2022. \n\nAs of October 1, 2022, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&#38;E and KU, elected to perform quantitative annual goodwill impairment tests. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of reporting units. Significant assumptions used in these approaches included discount and growth rates, projected outcomes of future rate filings, projected operating and capital cash flows, and select market data. Projected operating and capital cash flows are based on the internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain future events. \n\nThere were no indicators of impairment for any of the reporting units as the fair value of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations (LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the asset's useful life. \n\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. \n\nSee \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations\" in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 20 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Most Significant AROs Total ARO Recorded Amount Recorded % of Total Description LG&#38;E $ 86 $ 65 76 Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains KU 82 55 67 Ponds and landfills ##TABLE_END\n\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. At December 31, 2022, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $7 million at LG&#38;E and $10 million at KU. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $5 million at LG&#38;E and $1 million at KU and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million at LG&#38;E. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (All Registrants) \n\nFor RIE, LG&#38;E and KU, revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. \n\nFor PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff. In the fourth quarter of 2022, PPL Electric estimated deliveries to customers due to a temporary technical system issue. These estimates took into consideration factors similar to those considered by RIE, LG&#38;E and KU discussed above. The technical system issue has been resolved and unbilled revenues are expected to resume being calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nOther Information (All Registrants) \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL's Audit Committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules. The audit and audit-related services include services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings, reviews of offering documents and registration statements, and internal control reviews. \n\n"

Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" is separately filed by PPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. Information contained herein relating to any individual Registrant is filed by such Registrant solely on its own behalf, and no Registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other Registrant. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrant's related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for individual Registrants when significant. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following should be read in conjunction with the Registrants' Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. Capitalized terms and abbreviations are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. \n\n&#160; \n\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" includes the following information: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; \"Overview\" provides a description of each Registrant's business strategy and a discussion of important financial and operational developments. \n\n&#8226; \"Results of Operations\" for all Registrants includes a \"Statement of Income Analysis,\" which discusses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2022 with 2021.

Combined Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022. \n\nOverview \n\n&#160; \n\nFor a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see \"Item 1. Business.\" \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL operates four fully regulated high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Rhode Island, constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes. \n\nPPL's strategy, which is supported by the other Registrants and subsidiaries, is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in areas that we serve. \n\nCentral to PPL's and the other Registrants' strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms \n\nand other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, in addition to FERC formula rates, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Rhode Island, FERC formula rates, the gas cost adjustment, net metering, infrastructure, safety and reliability (ISR) and revenue decoupling mechanisms and other rate adjustment mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. \n\nFinancial and Operational Developments \n\n(PPL) \n\nAcquisition of Narragansett Electric \n\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S. (the Acquisition). The consideration for the Acquisition consisted of approximately $3.8 billion in cash and approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt assumed through the transaction. The $3.8 billion total cash consideration paid was funded with proceeds from PPL's 2021 sale of its U.K. utility business. The Acquisition resulted in $1.6 billion of goodwill. The results of RIE are reported in PPL's Rhode Island Regulated segment. \n\nThe acquisition of Narragansett Electric was deemed an asset acquisition for federal and state income tax purposes, as a result of PPL and National Grid making a tax election under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) &#167;338(h)(10). Accordingly, the tax bases of substantially all of the assets acquired were increased to fair market value, which equaled net book value, thereby eliminating the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. This election resulted in tax goodwill that will be amortized for tax purposes over 15 years. \n\nSee Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nSale of Safari Holdings \n\nOn September 29, 2022, PPL signed a definitive agreement to sell all of Safari Holdings membership interests to Aspen Power Services, LLC. On November 1, 2022, PPL completed the sale (the Transaction). \n\nA loss on sale of $60 million ($46 million net of tax benefit) was recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the Transaction, $53 million of goodwill previously presented in the Corporate and Other category for segment reporting purposes was written-off. \n\nSee Note 9 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nPennsylvania State Tax Reform (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nOn July 8, 2022, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Pennsylvania House Bill 1342 (H.B. 1342). Among other changes to the state tax code, the bill reduces the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% beginning January 1, 2023, and further reduces the rate annually by half a percentage point until the rate reaches 4.99% in 2031. \n\nGAAP requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary book-to-tax differences are expected to be realized or settled. In 2022, PPL and PPL Electric recorded an increase in regulatory liabilities of $270 million for the remeasurement of regulated accumulated deferred tax balances and a deferred tax benefit of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, associated with the remeasurement of non-regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances. The amounts recorded are estimates that will be updated quarterly to reflect revised forecast, actual activity, and applicable orders from regulatory authorities. \n\nInflation Reduction Act (All Registrants) \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA enacted a new 15% corporate \"book minimum tax,\" which is based on adjusted GAAP pre-tax income and is only applicable to corporations whose pre-tax income exceeds a certain threshold. PPL continues to assess the impacts of the IRA on the financial statements of PPL and the other Registrants and will monitor guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury in the future. PPL does not anticipate a material cash tax impact in the foreseeable future. In addition, the IRA enacted numerous new tax credits, largely associated with renewable energy. PPL continues to assess the applicability of these provisions to PPL and its subsidiaries. \n\nRegulatory Requirements \n\n( All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations. \n\nEnvironmental Considerations for Coal-Fired Generation (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nThe businesses of LG&#38;E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See Notes 7, 14 and 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LG&#38;E and KU to retire approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2010 . As part of the long-term generation planning process, LG&#38;E and KU evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets. \n\nAs a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, LG&#38;E anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the Mill Creek Plant and KU anticipates retiring one coal-fired unit at each of the E.W. Brown and Ghent plants. Mill Creek Unit 1, with 300 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2, with 297 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2027. E.W. Brown Unit 3, with 412 MW of capacity, and Ghent Unit 2, with 486 MW of capacity, are expected to be retired in 2028. LG&#38;E and KU anticipate the recovery of associated retirement costs, including the remaining net book value, for these coal-fired generating units through the RAR or other rate mechanisms. \n\nCPCN (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nOn December 15, 2022, LG&#38;E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction of two 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine facilities, one at LG&#38;E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky and the other at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky, including on-site natural gas and electric transmission construction associated with those facilities and site compatibility certificates. LG&#38;E and KU also applied for a CPCN to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, and for a CPCN to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky. LG&#38;E and KU further applied for a CPCN to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station and for approval of their proposed 2024-2030 DSM programs. The plan includes adding 14 new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs, which would reduce LG&#38;E's and KU's overall need by approximately 100 MW each. Finally, LG&#38;E and KU requested a declaratory order to confirm that their entry into non-firm energy-only power-purchase agreements for the output of four solar photovoltaic facilities with a combined capacity of 637 MW does not require KPSC approval and that LG&#38;E and KU may recover the costs of the solar PPAs through their fuel adjustment clause mechanisms as previously approved for a prior solar PPA. LG&#38;E and KU plan to accrue AFUDC on the constructed NGCCs, solar facility in Mercer County, Kentucky and the battery energy storage system facility and have requested regulatory asset treatment to recover the financing costs of these projects. \n\nThe plan is consistent with PPL's goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The replacement strategy, if approved, would reduce the carbon intensity of LG&#38;E and KU's generation fleet and result in nearly a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions from existing levels. \n\nThe KPSC accepted the filing as of January 6, 2023 and has indicated its intention to issue an order on all issues by November 6, 2023. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters. \n\nFERC Transmission Rate Filing (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nIn 2018, LG&#38;E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&#38;E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&#38;E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&#38;E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&#38;E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&#38;E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&#38;E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&#38;E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&#38;E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. On August 4, 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings at the FERC on remand. LG&#38;E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms and such rate recovery would be anticipated to be adjusted consistent with potential changes or terminations of the waivers and credits, as such become effective. \n\nRate Case Proceedings (KU) \n\nOn August 31, 2021, KU filed a request with the VSCC for an annual increase in Virginia base electricity rates of approximately $12 million, based on an authorized 10.4% return on equity. On March 11, 2022, KU, certain intervenors and the VSCC staff reached a partial stipulation and recommendation agreement providing KU with an increase in base electricity rates of approximately $7 million based on an authorized 9.4% return on equity. A hearing on open issues occurred on March 17, 2022. On May 25, 2022, the VSCC issued an order approving the proposed agreement. New rates became effective June 1, 2022. \n\nResults of Operations \n\n(PPL) \n\n&#160; \n\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing 2022 with 2021. The \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Adjusted Gross Margins\" discussions for PPL provide a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Adjusted Gross Margins,\" and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. \n\n&#160; \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\n&#160; \n\nA \"Statement of Income Analysis\" is presented separately for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. The \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2022 with 2021. The results of operations section for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instructions (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. \n\nPPL: Statement of Income Analysis, Segment Earnings and Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nStatement of Income Analysis \n\nNet income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results: \n\n##TABLE_START Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Operating Revenues $ 7,902 $ 5,783 $ 2,119 Operating Expenses Operation Fuel 931 710 221 Energy purchases 1,686 752 934 Other operation and maintenance 2,398 1,608 790 Depreciation 1,181 1,082 99 Taxes, other than income 332 207 125 Total Operating Expenses 6,528 4,359 2,169 Other Income (Expense) - net 54 15 39 Interest Expense 513 918 (405) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 915 521 394 Income Taxes 201 503 (302) Income from Continuing Operations After Income Taxes 714 18 696 \n\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) (Note 9) \n\n42 (1,498) 1,540 Net Income (Loss) $ 756 $ (1,480) $ 2,236 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Revenues \n\nThe increase (decrease) in operating revenues was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 PPL Electric distribution price (a) $ (19) PPL Electric distribution volume (b) 20 PPL Electric PLR (c) 520 PPL Electric transmission formula rate (d) 92 LG&#38;E fuel and other energy prices (e) 142 LG&#38;E retail rates (f) 50 LG&#38;E volumes 28 KU retail rates (f) 55 KU fuel and other energy prices (e) 160 KU volumes 29 Rhode Island Energy 1,038 Other 4 Total $ 2,119 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Distribution price variance was primarily due to reconcilable cost recovery mechanisms approved by the PAPUC. \n\n(b) The increase was due to colder weather combined with higher non-residential customer volumes. \n\n(c) The increase was primarily the result of higher energy prices, lower volumes of shopping customers and higher customer volumes due to colder weather. \n\n(d) The increase was primarily due to returns on additional transmission capital investments, a higher PPL zonal peak load billing factor in 2022 and the \n\nreduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity recorded in 2021. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the \n\ntransmission formula rate return on equity reduction. \n\n(e) The increase was primarily due to higher recoveries of fuel and energy purchases due to higher commodity costs. \n\n(f) The increase was due to new base rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2021. \n\nFuel \n\nFuel increased $221 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to an $81 million increase at LG&#38;E and a $140 million increase at KU, primarily due to higher commodity costs. \n\nEnergy Purchases \n\nEnergy purchases increased $934 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher PLR prices of $419 million and higher PLR volumes of $58 million at PPL Electric and a $78 million increase at LG&#38;E, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs and an additional $365 million due to the operations of RIE. \n\nOther Operation and Maintenance \n\nThe increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 PPL Electric Act 129 smart meter program $ 7 PPL Electric storm costs (10) PPL Electric IT cloud amortization costs 12 PPL Electric vegetation management costs 12 PPL Electric bad debts 14 PPL Electric canceled projects 8 LG&#38;E storm restoration costs 6 LG&#38;E natural gas inventory losses 4 KU plant outages 9 KU vegetation management costs 10 Rhode Island Energy (a) 684 Stock compensation expense 5 Sale of Safari Holdings (b) 60 Solar panel impairment (37) Charges related to the sale of the U.K. utility business (15) Other 21 Total $ 790 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes activity associated with the operations of RIE and integration and related costs. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(b) Loss on sale of Safari Holdings. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nDepreciation \n\nThe increase (decrease) in depreciation was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Additions to PP&#38;E, net (a) $ (3) Depreciation rate change (b) 12 Rhode Island Energy 92 Other (2) Total $ 99 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The decrease was primarily due to decreases in software and computer hardware depreciation at PPL Electric, as a result of end-of-life retirements, partially offset by additional assets placed into service, net of retirements at PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. \n\n(b) The increase was due to higher depreciation rates at LG&#38;E and KU effective July 2021. \n\nTaxes, Other Than Income \n\nThe increase (decrease) in taxes, other than income was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 State gross receipts tax (a) $ 63 Domestic property tax expense (a) 59 Other 3 Total $ 125 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Increase primarily due to the acquisition of RIE. \n\nOther Income (Expense) - net \n\nThe increase (decrease) in other income (expense) - net was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Defined benefit plans - non-service credits (Note 12) $ 26 Interest income (8) AFUDC - equity component 4 Other 17 Total $ 39 ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest Expense \n\nThe increase (decrease) in interest expense was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 vs. 2021 Loss on extinguishment of debt (a) $ (395) Long-term debt (b) (53) Rhode Island Energy 39 Other 4 Total $ (405) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) In June and July 2021, in connection with a tender offer, PPL Capital Funding retired $3,034 million combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Senior Notes for $3,426 million aggregate cash purchase price. The loss on extinguishment activity included the tender premium, make-whole premiums, accrued interest, bank fees and unamortized fees, hedges and discounts. \n\n(b) The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to PPL Capital Funding debt that was redeemed in June and July 2021, partially offset by increases at LG&#38;E, KU and PPL Electric. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Change in pre-tax income $ 128 Valuation allowance adjustments (a) (39) Impact of U.K. Finance Acts (b) (383) Other (8) Total $ (302) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) In 2021, PPL recorded a $31 million state deferred tax benefit on a net operating loss and an offsetting valuation allowance in connection with the loss on extinguishment associated with a tender offer to purchase and retire PPL Capital Funding's outstanding Senior Notes. \n\n(b) The U.K. Finance Act 2021, formally enacted on June 10, 2021, increased the U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The primary impact of the corporation tax rate increase was an increase in deferred tax liabilities of the U.K. utility business, which was sold on June 14, 2021, and a corresponding deferred tax expense of $383 million, which was recognized in continuing operations in 2021. \n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes. \n\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) \n\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) decreased $1,540 million in 2022 compared with 2021. The decrease was due to the completion of the U.K. utility business in the second quarter of 2021. See \"Discontinued Operations\" in Note 9 to the Financial Statements for summarized results of the operations of the U.K. utility business. \n\nSegment Earnings \n\nPPL's Net Income (Loss) by reportable segments was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Change &#160; 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Kentucky Regulated $ 507 $ 468 $ 39 Pennsylvania Regulated 525 445 80 Rhode Island Regulated (a) (44) &#8212; (44) Corporate and Other (b) (274) (895) 621 Discontinued Operations (a) 42 (1,498) 1,540 Net Income (Loss) $ 756 $ (1,480) $ 2,236 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(b) Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. \n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations \n\nManagement utilizes \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. \n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as: \n\n&#8226; Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. \n\n&#8226; Impairment charges. \n\n&#8226; Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. \n\n&#8226; Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. \n\n&#8226; Significant losses on early extinguishment of debt. \n\n&#8226; Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations. \n\nPPL's Earnings from Ongoing Operations by reportable segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the commitments made as a condition of the acquisition. \n\nAdjusted Gross Margins \n\nManagement also utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses. \n\n&#8226; \"Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\", \"Depreciation\" and \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations. \n\n&#8226; \"Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance,\" (which are primarily Act 129, Storm Damage and Universal Service program costs), \"Depreciation\" (which is primarily related to the Act 129 Smart Meter program) and \"Taxes, other than income,\" (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's electricity delivery operations. \n\n&#8226; \"Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Rhode Island Regulated segment, as well as the Rhode Island Regulated segment's \n\ndistribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance\" (which are primarily regional network transmission service, energy efficiency and storm cost related) and \"Taxes, other than income\" (which is primarily gross earnings tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from Rhode Island Regulated segment's electricity and gas delivery operations. \n\nThese measures are not intended to replace \"Operating Income,\" which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget. \n\nChanges in Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nThe following table shows Adjusted Gross Margins by PPL's reportable segment and by component, as applicable, for the year ended December 31 as well as the changes between periods. The factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; Change &#160; 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Kentucky Regulated &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins $ 2,460 $ 2,255 $ 205 Pennsylvania Regulated &#160; &#160; &#160; Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins &#160; &#160; &#160; Distribution $ 962 $ 915 $ 47 Transmission 739 674 65 Total Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins $ 1,701 $ 1,589 $ 112 Rhode Island Regulated Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins $ 441 $ &#8212; $ 441 ##TABLE_END\n\nKentucky Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nKentucky Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher base rates of $105 million, environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates of $66 million and higher sales volumes primarily due to weather of $29 million. \n\nThe increase in base rates was the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2021. The environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates were the result of the transfer of certain ECR and GLT expenses into base rates as a result of the 2020 Kentucky rate case. This transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the ECR and GLT programs being excluded from margins for all twelve months in 2022 compared to six months in 2021. \n\nPennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nDistribution \n\nDistribution Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher sales volumes of $17 million which included favorable weather of $11 million. Late payment charges increased $10 million as a result of not charging late payment fees for much of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. TCJA margins increased $11 million due to lower taxable income associated with the mechanism. Merchant Function Charge, which is added to the PTC rates to offset uncollectible expenses, increased by $8 million largely due to the energy price increases. \n\nTransmission \n\nTransmission Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $29 million increase as a result of a higher annual PPL zonal peak load billing factor in 2022 and $38 million of returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability. \n\nRhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nRhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins increased for 2022 compared with 2021, due to the acquisition of Narragansett Electric on May 25, 2022. \n\nReconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margins \n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Operating Income\" for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins (a) Other (b) Operating Income (c) Operating Revenues $ 3,811 $ 3,030 $ 1,088 $ (27) $ 7,902 Operating Expenses Fuel 931 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 931 Energy purchases 273 1,048 365 &#8212; 1,686 Other operation and maintenance 92 111 249 1,946 2,398 Depreciation 53 28 &#8212; 1,100 1,181 Taxes, other than income 2 142 33 155 332 Total Operating Expenses 1,351 1,329 647 3,201 6,528 Total $ 2,460 $ 1,701 $ 441 $ (3,228) $ 1,374 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 2021 Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins Rhode Island Adjusted Gross Margins Other (b) Operating Income (c) Operating Revenues $ 3,348 $ 2,430 $ &#8212; $ 5 $ 5,783 Operating Expenses Fuel 710 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 710 Energy purchases 186 566 &#8212; &#8212; 752 Other operation and maintenance 88 111 &#8212; 1,409 1,608 Depreciation 105 52 &#8212; 925 1,082 Taxes, other than income 4 112 &#8212; 91 207 Total Operating Expenses 1,093 841 &#8212; 2,425 4,359 Total $ 2,255 $ 1,589 $ &#8212; $ (2,420) $ 1,424 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Operating revenue excludes a $50 million customer bill credit to all electric and natural gas distribution customers that was treated as a special item.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the \n\ntransmission formula rate return on equity reduction. \n\n(e) The increase was primarily due to higher late payment charges in 2022, which were not billed until the fourth quarter 2021 due to the COVID pandemic. &#160; \n\nEnergy Purchases \n\nEnergy purchases increased $482 million in 2022 compared with 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher PLR prices of $419 million and higher PLR volumes of $58 million. \n\nOther Operation and Maintenance \n\nThe increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Act 129 smart meter program $ 7 Storm costs (10) IT cloud amortization costs 12 Vegetation management costs 12 Bad debts 14 Canceled projects 8 Support costs (9) Other 14 Total $ 48 ##TABLE_END\n\nDepreciation \n\nDepreciation decreased $31 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $38 million decrease in software and computer hardware depreciation as a result of end-of-life retirements, partially offset by $11 million of additional assets placed into service, net of retirements. \n\nLG&#38;E: Statement of Income Analysis \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results: \n\n##TABLE_START Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Operating Revenues Retail and wholesale $ 1,762 $ 1,545 $ 217 Electric revenue from affiliate 36 24 12 Total Operating Revenues 1,798 1,569 229 Operating Expenses Operation Fuel 346 265 81 Energy purchases 245 167 78 Energy purchases from affiliates 25 23 2 Other operation and maintenance 416 400 16 Depreciation 298 279 19 Taxes, other than income 48 46 2 Total Operating Expenses 1,378 1,180 198 Other Income (Expense) - net 4 (5) 9 Interest Expense 89 81 8 Income Taxes 63 54 9 Net Income $ 272 $ 249 $ 23 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\nThe increase (decrease) in operating revenues was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Fuel and other energy prices (a) $ 149 Retail rates (b) 50 Volumes 33 Other (3) Total $ 229 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The increase was primarily due to higher recoveries of fuel and energy purchases due to higher commodity costs. \n\n(b) The increase was due to new base rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2021. \n\nFuel \n\nFuel increased $81 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $67 million increase in commodity costs and a $14 million increase in volumes driven by weather. \n\nEnergy Purchases \n\nEnergy purchases increased $78 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs. \n\nOther Operation and Maintenance \n\nOther operation and maintenance increased $16 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $6 million increase in storm restoration costs and a $4 million increase in natural gas inventory losses. \n\nDepreciation \n\nDepreciation increased $19 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $12 million increase driven by additional assets placed into service, net of retirements, and an $8 million increase driven by higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2021. \n\nKU: Statement of Income Analysis \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results: \n\n##TABLE_START Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Operating Revenues Retail and wholesale $ 2,049 $ 1,803 $ 246 Electric revenue from affiliate 25 23 2 Total Operating Revenues 2,074 1,826 248 Operating Expenses Operation Fuel 585 445 140 Energy purchases 28 19 9 Energy purchases from affiliates 36 24 12 Other operation and maintenance 487 463 24 Depreciation 386 366 20 Taxes, other than income 45 41 4 Total Operating Expenses 1,567 1,358 209 Other Income (Expense) - net 8 4 4 Interest Expense 117 109 8 Income Taxes 76 67 9 Net Income $ 322 $ 296 $ 26 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Revenues \n\nThe increase (decrease) in operating revenues was due to: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Retail rates (a) $ 55 Fuel and energy prices (b) 165 Volumes 24 Other 4 Total $ 248 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The increases were due to new base rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2021. \n\n(b) The increases were primarily due to higher recoveries of fuel and energy purchases due to higher commodity costs. \n\nFuel \n\nFuel increased $140 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to an increase in commodity costs. \n\nOther Operation and Maintenance \n\nOther operations and maintenance increased $24 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $10 million increase in vegetation management expenses and a $9 million increase in plant outage expenses. \n\nDepreciation \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation increased $20 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to a $12 million increase driven by additional assets placed into service, net of retirements, and a $4 million increase driven by higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2021. \n\nFinancial Condition \n\n&#160; \n\nThe remainder of this Item 7 in this Form 10-K is presented on a combined basis, providing information, as applicable, for all Registrants. \n\n&#160; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants' cash flows from operations and access to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties.

The decrease in non-cash charges was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the impairment of solar panels in 2021, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits. \n\n&#8226; The $414 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory liabilities (primarily due to PPL Electric&#8217;s transmission formula rate return on equity reduction and the timing of rate recovery mechanisms) and a decrease in other current assets, partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather and rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in accounts receivable (primarily due to pricing) and an increase in accounts payable (primarily due to timing). \n\n&#8226; The $41 million decrease in defined benefit plan funding was primarily due to a decrease in contribution to pension plans in 2022, as PPL's defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements. \n\n&#8226; The $16 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was driven by an increase in non-current liabilities (primarily related to an increase in ARO expenditures and an increase in non-current regulatory liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accrued pension and postretirement obligations). \n\n(PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric's cash provided by operating activities in 2022 decreased $212 million compared with 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net income increased $80 million between the periods and included a decrease in non-cash components of $21 million. The decrease in non-cash components was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense (primarily related to a decrease in software and computer hardware depreciation as a result of end-of-life retirements). \n\n&#8226; The $262 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory liabilities (primarily due to refunds to customers related to the transmission formula rate return on equity reduction), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather and rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in accounts payable (due to timing) and an increase in accounts receivable (due to pricing). \n\n&#8226; The $21 million of activity in defined benefit plan funding was primarily due to a decrease in contribution to its pension plans in 2022, as PPL Electric's defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements. \n\n&#8226; The $30 million decrease in cash provided by other operating activities was driven primarily by an increase in non-current assets (primarily related to cloud computing and a decrease in medical claim payments). \n\n(LG&#38;E) \n\nLG&#38;E's cash provided by operating activities in 2022 increased $85 million compared with 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net income increased $23 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of $11 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements and higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2021), partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax expense (primarily due to book versus tax plant timing differences). \n\n&#8226; Cash from changes in working capital increased by $50 million. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory assets and liabilities, net (primarily due to the timing of rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in accounts payable to affiliates and other current liabilities (primarily due to timing of payments), partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather and higher commodity costs). \n\n(KU) \n\nKU's cash provided by operating activities in 2022 increased $53 million compared with 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net income increased $26 million between the periods and included an increase in non-cash components of $32 million. The increase in non-cash components was primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense (primarily due to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements and higher depreciation rates effective July 1, 2021). \n\n&#8226; Cash from changes in working capital increased $2 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, an increase in accounts payable with affiliates, an increase in taxes payable and a decrease in other current liabilities (primarily due to timing of payments) and other insignificant changes, partially offset by an increase in fuels, materials and supplies (primarily due to higher commodity costs and the accumulation of inventory for upcoming transmission and distribution products) and an increase in unbilled revenues and accounts receivable (primarily due to weather and higher commodity costs). \n\nInvesting Activities \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU 2022 vs. 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Change - Cash Provided (Used): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Expenditures for PP&#38;E $ (182) $ 12 $ 95 $ 13 Proceeds from sale of Safari Holdings, net of cash divested 146 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Proceeds from sale of U.K. utility business, net of cash divested (10,560) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Acquisition of Narragansett Electric, net of cash acquired (3,660) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Notes receivable from affiliate &#8212; 998 &#8212; &#8212; Other investing activities 38 3 11 (4) Total $ (14,218) $ 1,013 $ 106 $ 9 ##TABLE_END\n\nFor PPL, in 2022 compared with 2021, the increase in expenditures was due to expenditures at RIE, partially offset by a decrease in expenditures at LG&#38;E. The decrease in expenditures at LG&#38;E was primarily due to lower spending on ELG projects and other projects that are not individually significant. \n\nSee \"Forecasted Uses of Cash\" for detail regarding projected capital expenditures for the years 2023 through 2025. \n\nFor PPL Electric, the changes in \"Notes receivable from affiliate\" activity resulted from payments received on the short-term note between affiliates in 2022, issued to support general corporate purposes.

The following commercial paper programs were in place at: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 Capacity Commercial Paper Issuances (c) Unused Capacity PPL Capital Funding $ 1,350 $ 561 $ 789 PPL Electric 650 145 505 LG&#38;E (a) 500 180 320 KU (b) 400 101 299 Total PPL $ 2,900 $ 987 $ 1,913 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) In August 2022, the capacity for the LG&#38;E commercial paper program was increased to $500 million. \n\n(b) In August 2022, the capacity for the KU commercial paper program was increased to $400 million. \n\n(c) Commercial paper issued reflects the undiscounted face value of the issuance. \n\nLong-term Debt and Equity Securities \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries are authorized to issue, at the discretion of management and subject to market conditions, up to $3.50 billion of long-term debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. RIE is authorized to issue, at the discretion of management and subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, up to $500 million of long-term debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to repay short-term debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. \n\n(PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric is authorized to issue, at the discretion of management and subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, up to $1 billion of long-term debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. \n\n(LG&#38;E) \n\nLG&#38;E is authorized to issue, at the discretion of management and subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, up to $500 million of long-term debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to repay short-term debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. \n\n(KU) \n\nKU is authorized to issue, at the discretion of management and subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, up to $500 million of long-term debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to repay short-term debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. \n\nContributions from Parent (PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nFrom time to time, the parents of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU make capital contributions to subsidiaries. The proceeds from these contributions are used to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. \n\nForecasted Uses of Cash \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nIn addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, the Registrants currently expect to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common stock, and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nThe table below shows the Registrants' current capital expenditure projections for the years 2023 through 2025.

See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(g) Represents construction commitments, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above. \n\nDividends/Distributions \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts intended to maintain a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. In November 2022, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 3, 2023, at 22.50 cents per share (equivalent to $0.90 per annum). On February 17, 2023, PPL announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 24.00 cents per share, payable April 3, 2023, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2023. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. \n\nSubject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067. At December 31, 2022, no interest payments were deferred. \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nFrom time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends, distributions or return capital, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries. \n\nPurchase or Redemption of Debt Securities \n\nThe Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material. \n\nRating Agency Actions \n\nMoody's and S&#38;P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. \n\nA credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&#38;P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities. \n\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing \n\ncosts and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt. \n\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Senior Unsecured &#160; Senior Secured &#160; Commercial Paper Issuer &#160; Moody's &#160; S&#38;P &#160; Moody's &#160; S&#38;P &#160; Moody's &#160; S&#38;P PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Capital Funding &#160; Baa1 &#160; BBB+ &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; P-2 &#160; A-2 Rhode Island Energy A3 A- &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL and PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A1 &#160; A+ &#160; P-2 &#160; A-1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL, LG&#38;E and KU &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LG&#38;E &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A1 &#160; A &#160; P-2 &#160; A-2 KU &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A1 &#160; A &#160; P-2 &#160; A-2 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries. \n\n(PPL) \n\nIn June 2022, Moody&#8217;s affirmed its commercial paper rating for PPL Capital Funding and upgraded the following ratings with a \n\nstable outlook: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer rating from Baa2 to Baa1 for PPL; \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured rating from Baa2 to Baa1 for PPL Capital Funding; \n\n&#8226; the junior subordinated rating from Baa3 to Baa2 for PPL Capital Funding; and \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured bank credit facility rating from Baa2 to Baa1 for PPL Capital Funding. \n\nIn June 2022, Moody&#8217;s upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer rating from Baa1 to A3 for RIE; \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured rating from Baa1 to A3 for RIE; and \n\n&#8226; the preferred stock rating from Baa3 to Baa2 for RIE. \n\nIn June 2022, S&#38;P upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer rating from BBB+ to A- for RIE; \n\n&#8226; the senior unsecured rating from BBB+ to A- for RIE; and \n\n&#8226; the preferred stock rating from BBB- to BBB for RIE. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nIn May 2022, S&#38;P upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook for PPL Electric: \n\n&#8226; the long-term issuer credit rating from A- to A; \n\n&#8226; the issue-level senior secured rating from A to A+; and \n\n&#8226; the short-term and commercial paper ratings from A-2 to A-1. \n\nRatings Triggers (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nVarious derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, and interest rate instruments, contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LG&#38;E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of \"Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features,\" including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL and LG&#38;E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2022. \n\nGuarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL) \n\nPPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees. \n\nOther Contingent Obligations (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nRisk Management \n\nMarket Risk \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nSee Notes 1, 17 and 18 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations. \n\nThe forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases. \n\nThe following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) Maturities Ranging Through Exposure Hedged Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability) (a) Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) PPL and LG&#38;E &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Economic hedges &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest rate swaps (c) $ 64 $ (7) $ (1) 2033 $ 64 $ (19) $ (1) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes accrued interest, if applicable. \n\n(b) Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates. \n\n(c) Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. \n\nThe Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt and interest expense at December 31 is shown below. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 10% Adverse Movement in Rates on Fair Value of Debt 10% Adverse Movement in Rates on Interest Expense For Floating Exposure &#160; 2022 2021 2022 2021 PPL $ 495 $ 394 $ 16 $ &#8212; PPL Electric 178 164 6 &#8212; LG&#38;E 84 74 3 &#8212; KU 127 115 2 &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nPPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below. \n\n&#8226; PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. \n\n&#8226; LG&#38;E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&#38;E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs. \n\n&#8226; RIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC- approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices. \n\nVolumetric Risk \n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below. \n\n&#8226; PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases. \n\n&#8226; RIE is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates. \n\nDefined Benefit Plans - Equity Securities Price Risk \n\nSee \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits\" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets. \n\nCredit Risk \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance. \n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below. \n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E or KU defaults on its contractual obligation, those Registrants would need to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities. \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit. \n\n&#160; \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nRelated Party Transactions \n\nThe Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU. \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions, Development and Divestitures \n\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures, and development projects. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on acquisition and divestiture activity. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the Registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. \n\nSee \"Legal Matters\" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental claims. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. See \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information. \n\nSustainability \n\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of &#8220;sustainability&#8221;, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer&#8217;s business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8217;34 Act), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their &#8217;34 Act reports. In March 2022, the SEC proposed broad-based climate disclosure requirements for public companies. The proposed rule would require public companies to disclose direct and indirect GHG emissions, strategic insights, and certain financial implications in public disclosures. The proposed rulemaking elicited significant debate and comment. While a final rulemaking is currently expected to be issued in the spring of 2023, PPL cannot predict the final legal requirements or when the requirements will be effective. \n\nAs has been PPL&#8217;s practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants&#8217; financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric and gas utility industry. Additionally, PPL consults widely used reporting frameworks for discrete sustainability topics, including corporate political contributions and climate-related issues. PPL also responds to the climate survey of CDP, a not-for-profit organization based in the United Kingdom formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that runs the global disclosure system that enables investors, companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts. \n\nCybersecurity \n\nSee &#8220;Cybersecurity Management&#8221; in &#8220;Item 1.

The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them. \n\nDefined Benefits \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 7 and 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits. \n\nA summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START Plan Sponsor PPL &#160; PPL Electric &#160; LG&#38;E &#160; KU PPL Services S &#160; P &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LKE &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; P &#160; P ##TABLE_END\n\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on \n\nestimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are: \n\n&#8226; Discount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio. \n\n&#8226; Expected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption. \n\n&#8226; Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices. \n\nSee Note 12 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. \n\nThe following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption. \n\n##TABLE_START Increase (Decrease) Actuarial assumption &#160; Discount Rate (0.25 %) Expected Return on Plan Assets (0.25 %) Rate of Compensation Increase 0.25 % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Increase) Decrease Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Actuarial assumption Defined Benefit Asset Defined Benefit Liabilities AOCI (pre-tax) Net Regulatory Assets Defined Benefit Costs PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rates $ (14) $ (78) $ 27 $ 65 $ 14 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a n/a n/a 10 Rate of compensation increase (2) (6) 2 6 3 PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Discount rates &#8212; (34) &#8212; 34 5 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a &#8212; n/a 4 Rate of compensation increase &#8212; (2) &#8212; 2 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LG&#38;E Discount rates (9) 1 n/a 10 2 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a n/a n/a 1 Rate of compensation increase (1) &#8212; n/a 1 &#8212; KU Discount rates (8) 1 n/a 9 2 Expected return on plan assets n/a n/a n/a n/a 1 Rate of compensation increase (1) &#8212; n/a 1 &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants) \n\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. \n\nAdditionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. \n\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. When evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such factors is also considered by management. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. \n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities (All Registrants) \n\nPPL Electric, LG&#38;E, KU and RIE are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. \n\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets. \n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices. \n\nPrice Risk Management (PPL) \n\nSee \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above. \n\nGoodwill Impairment (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting units of PPL include the Kentucky Regulated reporting unit, the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting unit, and the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. LG&#38;E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments and each are single reporting units. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. \n\nManagement assigned the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the RIE acquisition to the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, RIE goodwill of $1,586 million was assigned to PPL&#8217;s reporting units. To determine the amount of the RIE goodwill assigned to PPL&#8217;s reporting units, management calculated the fair value of the Kentucky Regulated and the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit to those reporting units. The difference in the fair values of the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit from the acquisition of RIE represents goodwill derived from the acquisition and was assigned to the respective reporting units. The remainder of the RIE goodwill was assigned to the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. \n\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. \n\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually LG&#38;E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances by reportable segment at December 31, 2022. \n\nAs of October 1, 2022, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&#38;E and KU, elected to perform quantitative annual goodwill impairment tests. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of reporting units. Significant assumptions used in these approaches included discount and growth rates, projected outcomes of future rate filings, projected operating and capital cash flows, and select market data. Projected operating and capital cash flows are based on the internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain future events. \n\nThere were no indicators of impairment for any of the reporting units as the fair value of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations (LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the asset's useful life. \n\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. \n\nSee \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations\" in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 20 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Most Significant AROs Total ARO Recorded Amount Recorded % of Total Description LG&#38;E $ 86 $ 65 76 Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains KU 82 55 67 Ponds and landfills ##TABLE_END\n\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. At December 31, 2022, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $7 million at LG&#38;E and $10 million at KU. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $5 million at LG&#38;E and $1 million at KU and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million at LG&#38;E. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (All Registrants) \n\nFor RIE, LG&#38;E and KU, revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. \n\nFor PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff. In the fourth quarter of 2022, PPL Electric estimated deliveries to customers due to a temporary technical system issue. These estimates took into consideration factors similar to those considered by RIE, LG&#38;E and KU discussed above. The technical system issue has been resolved and unbilled revenues are expected to resume being calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff in the first quarter of 2023. \n\n"

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company \n\n&#160; \n\nReference is made to \"Risk Management\" for the Registrants in \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of PPL Corporation \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities &#8211; Impact of Rate Regulation on Various Account Balances and Disclosures &#8211; Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company owns and operates four cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC), the Virginia State Corporation Commission (VSCC), the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC), and the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (RIPUC) to enable the regulated utilities to recover the costs of providing electric or gas services, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC, RIPUC, and Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities \n\nand Carriers. The accounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts various account balances, disclosures, including regulated utility plant, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation and income taxes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a recorded regulatory assets balance of $2,077 million and regulatory liabilities balance of $3,650 million. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s regulated utilities&#8217; rates are subject to cost-based rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are established based on an analysis of the costs incurred and the regulated utility&#8217;s capital structure and must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC, RIPUC, and Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC, RIPUC, and Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and an adequate return on capital investments. Current and future regulatory decisions can impact the timing of future utility plant retirements, the rate of return earned on investments, and the timing and amounts of cost recovery. While the Company&#8217;s utilities have indicated that they expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC, RIPUC, and Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers will not approve full recovery of such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors, such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending legislation. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate-setting process due to its inherent complexities. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC, RIPUC, and Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets. We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the recognition of amounts as regulated utility plant, regulatory assets or liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation, income taxes, and note disclosures. We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s internal controls over the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, PAPUC, RIPUC and Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers for the Company&#8217;s regulated utilities and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervening parties, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; We inquired of management about regulated utility plant that may be abandoned. We inspected minutes of the Board of Directors, other public information, regulatory orders, and other filings with the commissions to identify any evidence that could indicate utility plant may be abandoned. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. \n\nGoodwill arising from Acquisition of Rhode Island Energy &#8211; Refer to Notes 1, 9 and 19 to the Financial Statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company&#8217;s balance sheet includes $2,248 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2022, of which $1,586 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy (the \"Acquisition\") and assigned to the Company&#8217;s reporting units. \n\nTo determine the amount of goodwill from the Acquisition assigned to each of the Company&#8217;s reporting units, management calculated the fair value of the Kentucky Regulated and the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit to those reporting units from the Acquisition. The difference in the fair values of the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated reporting units with-and-without the expected benefit from the Acquisition represents goodwill derived from the Acquisition and was assigned to the respective reporting units. The remainder of the goodwill from the Acquisition was assigned to the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. \n\nWe identified the assignment of goodwill from the Acquisition to the Company&#8217;s reporting units as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to determine the amount assigned to each reporting unit. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions related to the assignment of goodwill to the Company&#8217;s reporting units. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the amount of goodwill from the Acquisition assigned to each of the Company&#8217;s reporting units based on management&#8217;s fair value calculation included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s internal controls over their assignment of goodwill from the Acquisition to each reporting unit, including those over the determination of the fair value calculated based on a with-and-without expected benefit. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of management&#8217;s expected benefit by comparing to: \n\n&#9702; Historical results. \n\n&#9702; Internal communications to management and the board of directors. \n\n&#9702; Information included in the Company&#8217;s press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the amount of goodwill from the Acquisition assigned to each reporting unit based on management&#8217;s fair value calculation by: \n\n&#9702; Testing the source information underlying the determination of discount and growth rates. \n\n&#9702; Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMorristown, New Jersey &#160; \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareowner and the Board of Directors of PPL Electric Utilities Corporation \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PPL Electric Utilities Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities &#8211; Impact of Rate Regulation on Various Account Balances and Disclosures &#8211; Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation (PPL Electric) is a cost-based rate-regulated utility for which rates are set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) to enable the regulated utility to recover the costs of providing electric service and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC and PAPUC. The accounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts various account balances and disclosures, including regulated utility plant, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation, and income taxes. As of December \n\n31, 2022, PPL Electric had a recorded regulatory assets balance of $581 million and regulatory liabilities balance of $905 million. \n\nPPL Electric&#8217;s regulated utility&#8217;s rates are subject to cost-based rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are established based on an analysis of the costs incurred and the regulated utility&#8217;s capital structure and must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC and PAPUC. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The FERC and PAPUC regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and an adequate return on capital investments. Current and future regulatory decisions can impact the rate of return earned on investments and the timing and amounts of cost recovery. While PPL Electric has indicated that it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the FERC or PAPUC will not approve full recovery of such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending legislation. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate-setting process due to its inherent complexities. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC and PAPUC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets. We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the recognition of amounts as regulated utility plant, regulatory assets or liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation, income taxes, and note disclosures. We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s internal controls over the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC and PAPUC for PPL Electric and other public utilities in Pennsylvania, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervening parties, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; We inquired of management about regulated utility plant that may be abandoned. We inspected minutes of the Board of Directors, other public information, regulatory orders and other filings with the commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management&#8217;s assertion regarding probability of an abandonment. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated PPL Electric&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMorristown, New Jersey &#160; \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholder and the Board of Directors of Louisville Gas and Electric Company \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Louisville Gas and Electric Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities&#8211; Impact of Rate-Regulation on Various Account Balances and Disclosures &#8211; Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is a cost-based rate-regulated utility for which rates are set by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to enable the regulated utility to recover the costs of providing electric or gas services, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the KPSC and FERC. The accounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts various account balances and disclosures, including regulated utility plant, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation, and income taxes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a recorded regulatory assets balance of $396 million and regulatory liabilities balance of $840 million. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s regulated utility&#8217;s rates are subject to cost-based rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are established based on an analysis of the costs incurred and the regulated utility&#8217;s capital structure and must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the KPSC and FERC.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nGeneral \n\nCapitalized terms and abbreviations appearing in the combined notes to financial statements are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrants' related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant. \n\nBusiness and Consolidation \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL is a utility holding company that, through its regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in: 1) the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; 2) the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Pennsylvania; and 3) the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas in Rhode Island. Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal subsidiaries are LG&#38;E, KU, RIE and PPL Electric. PPL's corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding. \n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited entered into a share purchase agreement to sell PPL's U.K. utility business, which prior to its sale substantially represented PPL's U.K. Regulated segment, to a subsidiary of National Grid plc. The sale was completed on June 14, 2021. The results of operations of the U.K. utility business are classified as Discontinued Operations on PPL's Statements of Income for all periods presented. PPL has elected to separately report the cash flows of continuing and discontinued operations on the Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations. See Note 9 for additional information. \n\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of PPL, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S., a subsidiary of National Grid plc. Narragansett Electric, whose service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island, is primarily engaged in the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas. The results of Narragansett Electric are included in the consolidated results of PPL from the date of the acquisition. Following the closing of the acquisition, Narragansett Electric provides services doing business under the name Rhode Island Energy (RIE). See Note 9 for additional information. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric's principal business is the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nLG&#38;E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG&#38;E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas. LG&#38;E and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names. KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe financial statements of the Registrants include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE and, as a result, are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Amounts consolidated under the VIE guidance are not material to the Registrants. \n\nAll significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. \n\nThe financial statements of PPL, LG&#38;E and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 13 for additional information. \n\nRegulation \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL Electric, RIE, LG&#38;E and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, RIE, LG&#38;E and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover expected future costs, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions. See Note 7 for additional details regarding regulatory matters. \n\nAccounting Records \n\nThe system of accounts for regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nLoss Accruals \n\nPotential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is \"probable\" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines \"probable\" as cases in which \"the future event or events are likely to occur.\" The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate. \n\nThe accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured. \n\nEarnings Per Share (PPL) \n\nEPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners. Share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities. \n\nPrice Risk Management \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. Derivative instruments pursuant to regulator approved plans to manage commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases to reduce fluctuations in natural gas prices and costs associated with these derivatives instruments are generally recoverable through approved cost recovery mechanism. Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation. \n\nCertain contracts may not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved to facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative contracts may be excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because NPNS has been elected. These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting. Contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheets at fair value. \n\nCash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification of the hedged items. \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements. \n\n(PPL) \n\nProcesses exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of contract information as it relates to interest rate derivatives and commodity gas contracts. The accounting department provides the treasury department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various contract types and strategies. Examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; Transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring. \n\n&#8226; Transactions to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges. \n\n&#8226; Derivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge treatment are marked to fair value through earnings. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nDerivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities at PPL Electric, RIE, LG&#38;E and KU, if approved by the appropriate regulatory body. These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps or commodity gas contracts that are included in customer rates. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nTo meet their obligations as last resort providers to their customers, PPL Electric and RIE have entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nSee Notes 17 and 18 for additional information on derivatives. \n\nRevenue (All Registrants) \n\nOperating revenues are primarily recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of each calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than at the end of the month. For RIE, LG&#38;E and KU, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. For PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff. In the fourth quarter of 2022, PPL Electric estimated deliveries to customers due to a temporary technical system issue. The issue has been resolved and unbilled revenues are expected to resume being calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nPPL Electric's, RIE's, LG&#38;E's and KU's base rates are determined based on cost of service. Some regulators have also authorized the use of additional alternative revenue programs, which enable PPL Electric, RIE, LG&#38;E and KU to adjust future rates based on past activities or completed events. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are recognized when the specific events permitting future billings have occurred. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are required to be presented separately from revenues from contracts with customers. These amounts are, however, presented as revenues from contracts with customers, with an offsetting adjustment to alternative revenue program revenue, when they are billed to customers in future periods. See Note 3 for additional information. \n\nFinancing and Other Receivables \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Financing receivables include accounts receivable, with the exception of those items within accounts receivable that are not subject to the current expected credit loss model. \n\nFinancing receivable collectability is evaluated using a current expected credit loss model, consisting of a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs and the age of the receivable. Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered when applicable. The Registrants also evaluate the impact of observable external factors on the collectability of the financing receivables to determine if adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts should be made based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on the results of these analyses. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible. \n\nPPL Electric, RIE, LG&#38;E and KU have identified one class of financing receivables, &#8220;accounts receivable - customer&#8221;, which includes financing receivables for all billed and unbilled sales with customers. All other financing receivables are classified as other. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nWithin the credit loss model for the residential customer accounts receivables, customers are disaggregated based on their projected propensity to pay, which is derived from historical trends and the current activity of the individual customer accounts. Conversely, the non-residential customer accounts receivables are not further segmented due to the varying nature of the individual customers, which lack readily identifiable risk characteristics for disaggregation. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included in the following table. Amounts relate to financing receivables, except as noted. \n\n##TABLE_START Additions Balance at Beginning of Period Charged to Income Deductions (b) Balance at End of Period PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 $ 69 &#160; $ 78 &#160; $ 52 &#160; $ 95 &#160; (d) 2021 73 &#160; 26 &#160; 30 &#160; 69 &#160; (d) 2020 (a) 58 &#160; (a) 28 &#160; 13 &#160; 73 &#160; (d) \n\nPPL Electric \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 $ 35 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 29 &#160; $ 33 &#160; (c) 2021 41 &#160; 13 &#160; 19 &#160; 35 &#160; (c) 2020 30 &#160; (a) 19 &#160; 8 &#160; 41 &#160; (c) LG&#38;E &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 $ 3 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 4 &#160; 2021 3 &#160; 4 &#160; 4 &#160; 3 &#160; 2020 1 &#160; 4 &#160; 2 &#160; 3 &#160; KU &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 $ 3 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 3 &#160; 2021 2 &#160; 8 &#160; 7 &#160; 3 &#160; 2020 1 &#160; 4 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Adjusted for $ 2 million cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of current expected credit loss guidance. \n\n(b) Primarily related to uncollectible accounts written off. \n\n(c) Includes $ 3 million related to other accounts receivables at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n(d) Includes $ 36 million, $ 32 million and $ 30 million related to other accounts receivables at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nCash \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nCash Equivalents \n\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. \n\n(PPL) \n\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents \n\nBank deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents. On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is included in \"Other current assets,\" while the noncurrent portion is included in \"Other noncurrent assets.\" See Note 17 for a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the Balance Sheets to the amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities in defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents. PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. \n\nThe Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. \n\n&#8226; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n\n&#8226; Level 3 - unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value. \n\nAssessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nInvestments \n\nGenerally, the original maturity date of an investment and management's intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term. Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term. \n\nInvestments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments are carried at cost or fair value. These investments are included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. Earnings from these investments are recorded in \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income. \n\nShort-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Balance Sheets. \n\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPP&#38;E is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset. PP&#38;E acquired in business combinations is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. Original cost for constructed assets includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, \n\nwhere applicable. Included in PP&#38;E are capitalized costs of software projects that were developed or obtained for internal use. The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. The Registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which work is performed and costs are incurred. \n\nAFUDC is capitalized at PPL Electric and RIE as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service. The debt component of AFUDC is credited to \"Interest Expense\" and the equity component is credited to \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income. AFUDC capitalized at LG&#38;E and KU is generally not significant because a return is provided on construction work in progress. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nRIE and PPL Electric capitalize interest costs as part of construction costs. Capitalized interest, including the debt component of AFUDC, for the years ended December 31 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 PPL $ 7 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 7 &#160; PPL Electric 5 &#160; 6 &#160; 7 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDepreciation (All Registrants) \n\nDepreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component of PP&#38;E that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that \n\nwas depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. RIE, LG&#38;E and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices. Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred. For LG&#38;E and KU, all ARO depreciation expenses are reclassified to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. See \"Asset Retirement Obligations\" below and Note 7 for additional information. PPL Electric records net costs of removal when incurred as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset is subsequently amortized through depreciation over a five-year period, which is recoverable in customer rates in accordance with regulatory practices. \n\nFollowing are the weighted-average annual rates of depreciation, for regulated utility plant, for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 PPL 3.21 &#160; % 3.61 &#160; % 3.53 &#160; % PPL Electric 2.75 &#160; % 3.05 &#160; % 2.99 &#160; % LG&#38;E 4.16 &#160; % 3.99 &#160; % 4.00 &#160; % KU 4.01 &#160; % 4.17 &#160; % 4.00 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( All Registrants) \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. \n\nOther acquired intangible assets are initially measured based on their fair value. Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. Costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets. \n\nWhen determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider: \n\n&#8226; the expected use of the asset; \n\n&#8226; the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate; \n\n&#8226; legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life; \n\n&#8226; the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension; \n\n&#8226; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and, \n\n&#8226; the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. \n\nAsset Impairment (Excluding Investments) \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. \n\nA long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impaired, the asset's carrying value is written down to its fair value. \n\nA long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. If impaired, the asset's (disposal group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell. \n\nPPL, LG&#38;E and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed. PPL's, LG&#38;E's and KU's reporting units are primarily at the operating segment level. \n\nGoodwill recognized upon the acquisition of Narragansett Electric was assigned for impairment testing by PPL to its reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition, which were the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit, the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting unit and the Kentucky Regulated reporting unit. See Note 9 for additional information regarding the acquisition. \n\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually LG&#38;E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as step zero) is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, the quantitative impairment test is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the step zero assessment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \n\nAs of October 1, 2022, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&#38;E and KU, elected to perform quantitative annual goodwill impairment tests. There were no indicators of impairment for any of the reporting units as the fair value of each of the reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. \n\n( PPL, LG&#38;E and KU ) \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of accretion expense classified within \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income to reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. For LG&#38;E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal. \n\nEstimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. See Note 7 and Note 20 for additional information on AROs. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nDefined Benefits (All Registrants) \n\nCertain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LG&#38;E, KU, RIE and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. \n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value. \n\nPPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30 % of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the required amortization period. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 % of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30 % of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the full required amortization period. \n\nSee Note 7 for a discussion of the regulatory treatment of defined benefit costs and Note 12 for a discussion of defined benefits. \n\nStock-Based Compensation (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors. PPL grants most stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year. PPL and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value method. Forfeitures of awards are recognized when they occur. See Note 11 for a discussion of stock-based compensation. All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily included in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income. \n\nTaxes \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. \n\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. \n\nThe Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in its financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization upon settlement that exceeds 50 %. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle the uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future periods. At December 31, 2022, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits were projected over the next 12 months. \n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. \n\nThe Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The need for valuation allowances requires significant management judgment. If the Registrants determine that \n\nthey are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future . \n\nThe Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are generated and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets. \n\nThe Registrants recognize tax-related interest and penalties in \"Income Taxes\" on their Statements of Income. \n\nThe Registrants use the portfolio approach method of accounting for deferred taxes related to pre-tax OCI transactions. The portfolio approach involves a strict period-by-period cumulative incremental allocation of income taxes to the change in income and losses reflected in OCI. Under this approach, the net cumulative tax effect is ignored. The net change in unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI under this approach would be eliminated only on the date the investment portfolio is classified as held for sale or is liquidated. \n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures. \n\nThe provision for the Registrants' deferred income taxes related to regulatory assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by relevant regulators. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulatory assets and liabilities and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities.\" \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nThe income tax provision for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement, which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Electric, LG&#38;E, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return. Tax benefits are not shared between companies. The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit. The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes. \n\nAt December 31, the following intercompany tax receivables (payables) were recorded: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 PPL Electric $ 2 &#160; $ ( 4 ) LG&#38;E ( 6 ) 4 &#160; KU 4 &#160; 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nTaxes, Other Than Income (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants present sales taxes in \"Other current liabilities\" on the Balance Sheets. These taxes are not reflected on the Statements of Income. See Note 6 for details of taxes included in \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income. \n\nOther \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nLeases \n\nThe Registrants determine whether contractual arrangements contain a lease by evaluating whether those arrangements either implicitly or explicitly identify an asset, whether the Registrants have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the term of the arrangement, and whether the Registrants have the right to direct the use of the asset. Renewal options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain the Registrants will exercise those options. Periods for which the Registrants are reasonably certain not to exercise termination options are also included in the lease term. The Registrants have certain agreements with lease and non-lease components, such as office space leases, which are generally accounted for separately. \n\nShort-term leases are leases with a term that is 12 months or less and do not include a purchase option or option to extend the initial term of the lease to greater than 12 months that the Registrants are reasonably certain to exercise. The Registrants have made an accounting policy election to not recognize the right-of-use asset and the lease liability arising from leases classified as short-term. \n\nThe discount rate for a lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. In that case, the Registrants are required to use their incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate the Registrants would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. \n\nThe Registrants receive secured borrowing rates from financial institutions based on their applicable credit profiles. The Registrants use the secured rate which corresponds with the term of the applicable lease. See Note 10 for additional information. \n\nFuel, Materials and Supplies \n\nFuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies are valued using the average cost method. Fuel costs for electricity generation are charged to expense as used. For RIE, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense when delivered to customers. For LG&#38;E, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense as delivered to the distribution system. See Note 7 for further discussion of the fuel adjustment clauses and gas supply clause. \n\n\"Fuel, materials and supplies\" on the Balance Sheets consisted of the following at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 &#160; PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU Fuel $ 125 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 44 &#160; $ 81 &#160; Natural gas stored underground 91 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 68 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Materials and supplies 227 &#160; 69 &#160; 54 &#160; 86 &#160; Total $ 443 &#160; $ 69 &#160; $ 166 &#160; $ 167 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2021 &#160; PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU Fuel $ 90 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 32 &#160; $ 58 &#160; Natural gas stored underground 54 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 54 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Materials and supplies 178 &#160; 61 &#160; 51 &#160; 66 &#160; Total $ 322 &#160; $ 61 &#160; $ 137 &#160; $ 124 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(PPL) \n\nRenewable Energy Standard Obligation \n\nPurchased Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are stated at cost and are used to measure compliance with state renewable energy standards. RECs support new renewable generation standards and are held primarily to be utilized in fulfillment of RIE&#8217;s compliance obligations. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nGuarantees \n\nGenerally, the initial measurement of a guarantee liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. However, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance that only require disclosure. See Note 14 for further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees. \n\n(PPL) \n\nTreasury Stock \n\nPPL generally restores all shares of common stock acquired to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon or soon after acquisition. In connection with its share repurchases in 2021, PPL has not yet returned these shares to authorized but unissued shares; it intends to retain some portion of these shares as Treasury stock to use in connection with certain compensation plans. \n\n2. Segment and Related Information \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL is organized into three segments: Kentucky Regulated, Pennsylvania Regulated, and Rhode Island Regulated. PPL's segments are segmented by geographic location. \n\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LG&#38;E's and KU's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations, as well as LG&#38;E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, the Kentucky Regulated segment includes certain financing and other costs at LKE. \n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. \n\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution operations of RIE, which was acquired on May 25, 2022. \n\n\"Corporate and Other\" primarily includes financing and other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain non-recoverable costs resulting from commitments made to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island in conjunction with the acquisition of Narragansett Electric. \n\nAs a result of the June 14, 2021 sale of the U.K. utility business, PPL determined segment information for the U.K. Regulated segment would no longer be provided beginning with the March 31, 2021 Form 10-Q. See Note 9 for additional information. \n\nIncome Statement data for the segments and reconciliation to PPL's consolidated results for the years ended December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Operating Revenues from external customers (a) &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 3,811 &#160; $ 3,348 &#160; $ 3,106 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 3,030 &#160; 2,402 &#160; 2,330 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated 1,038 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other 23 &#160; 33 &#160; 38 &#160; Total $ 7,902 &#160; $ 5,783 &#160; $ 5,474 &#160; Depreciation &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 685 &#160; $ 647 &#160; $ 606 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 393 &#160; 424 &#160; 403 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated 92 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other 11 &#160; 11 &#160; 13 &#160; Total $ 1,181 &#160; $ 1,082 &#160; $ 1,022 &#160; Amortization (b) &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 23 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 19 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 22 &#160; 19 &#160; 26 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 13 &#160; Total $ 52 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 58 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Interest Expense (c) &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 262 &#160; $ 249 &#160; $ 300 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 171 &#160; 162 &#160; 172 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other (d) 41 &#160; 507 &#160; 162 &#160; Total $ 513 &#160; $ 918 &#160; $ 634 &#160; Income Before Income Taxes &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 621 &#160; $ 562 &#160; $ 516 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 699 &#160; 599 &#160; 664 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated ( 58 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other ( 347 ) ( 640 ) ( 226 ) Total $ 915 &#160; $ 521 &#160; $ 954 &#160; Income Taxes (e) &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 114 &#160; $ 94 &#160; $ 98 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 174 &#160; 154 &#160; 167 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated ( 14 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other ( 73 ) 255 &#160; 49 &#160; Total $ 201 &#160; $ 503 &#160; $ 314 &#160; Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits (f) &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 6 &#160; $ 272 &#160; $ 64 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 91 &#160; 79 &#160; 82 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other 43 &#160; ( 264 ) 23 &#160; Total $ 179 &#160; $ 87 &#160; $ 169 &#160; Net Income &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky Regulated $ 507 &#160; $ 468 &#160; $ 418 &#160; Pennsylvania Regulated 525 &#160; 445 &#160; 497 &#160; Rhode Island Regulated ( 44 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate and Other (d) ( 274 ) ( 895 ) ( 275 ) Discontinued Operations 42 &#160; ( 1,498 ) 829 &#160; Total $ 756 &#160; $ ( 1,480 ) $ 1,469 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) See Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on Operating Revenues. \n\n(b) Represents non-cash expense items that include amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, regulatory assets and liabilities, debt discounts and premiums and debt issuance costs. \n\n(c) Beginning in 2021, corporate level financing costs are no longer allocated to the reportable segments and are being reported in Corporate and Other.

Prior to January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment also included the financing activities of LKE. The financing activity of LKE will be presented in Corporate and Other beginning on January 1, 2023. As a result of this change, beginning on January 1, 2023, PPL&#8217;s segments will consist of the regulated operations of Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and will exclude any incremental financing activities of holding companies, which Management believes is a more meaningful presentation as it provides information on the core regulated operations of PPL. \n\n(PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nPPL Electric has two operating segments, distribution and transmission, which are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LG&#38;E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments. \n\n3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which the Registrants and PPL&#8217;s segments generate their revenues. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPennsylvania Regulated Segment Revenue \n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from PPL Electric&#8217;s tariff-based distribution and transmission of electricity. \n\nDistribution Revenue \n\nPPL Electric provides distribution services to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and governmental end users of energy. PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to its distribution customers and revenue is recognized over-time as electricity is delivered and simultaneously consumed by the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the volume of electricity delivered during the period multiplied by the price per tariff, plus a monthly fixed charge. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of electric service to the customer as the calculation is based on volumes delivered, and the price per tariff and the monthly fixed charge are set by the PAPUC. Customers are typically billed monthly and outstanding amounts are normally due within 21 days of the date of the bill. \n\nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of PPL Electric with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with PPL Electric&#8217;s retail account contracts. \n\nCertain customers have the option to obtain electricity or natural gas from other suppliers. In those circumstances, revenue is only recognized for providing delivery of the commodity to the customer. \n\nTransmission Revenue \n\nPPL Electric generates transmission revenues from a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff. An annual revenue requirement for PPL Electric to provide transmission services is calculated using a formula-based rate. This revenue requirement is converted into a daily rate (dollars per day). PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to provide transmission services and revenue is recognized over-time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC approved formula-based rate. PJM remits payment on a weekly basis. \n\nPPL Electric's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, PPL Electric has no unsatisfied performance obligations. \n\n(PPL) \n\nRhode Island Regulated Segment Revenues \n\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from RIE&#8217;s regulated tariff-based transmission and distribution of electricity and regulated tariff-based distribution of natural gas. \n\nDistribution Revenue \n\nDistribution revenues are primarily from the sale of electricity, natural gas, and related services to retail customers. Distribution sales are regulated by the RIPUC, which is responsible for approving the rates and other terms of services as part of the rate making process. Natural gas and electric distribution revenues are derived from the regulated sale and distribution of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within RIE&#8217;s service territory under the tariff rates. The performance obligation related to distribution sales is to provide electricity and natural gas to customers on demand. The performance obligation is satisfied over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the electricity or natural gas as services are provided. RIE records revenues related to the distribution sales based upon the approved tariff rate and the volume delivered to the customers, which corresponds with the amount RIE has the right to invoice. \n\nDistribution revenue also includes estimated unbilled amounts, which represent the estimated amounts due from retail customers as a result of customer's bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues are determined based on estimated unbilled sales volumes and then applying tariff rates to those volumes. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents RIE's transfer of electricity and natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as approved by the respective regulatory body. \n\nCertain customers have the option to obtain electricity or natural gas from other suppliers. In those circumstances, revenue is only recognized for providing delivery of the commodity to the customer. \n\nTransmission Revenue \n\nRIE&#8217;s transmission services are regulated by the FERC and coordinated with ISO &#8211; New England (ISO-NE). Additionally, RIE makes available its transmission facilities to NEP, for operation and control pursuant to an integrated facilities agreement, Service Agreement No. 23 (Integrated Facilities Agreement or IFA). As of December 31, 2022 these integrated facilities agreements have concluded as RIE is a transmission operator. These revenues arise under tariff/rate agreements and are collected primarily from RIE&#8217;s distribution customers. The revenue is recognized over-time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents RIE&#8217;s transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC-approved formula-based rate. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nKentucky Regulated Segment Revenue \n\nThe Kentucky Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from LG&#38;E's and KU's regulated tariff-based sales of electricity and LG&#38;E's regulated tariff-based sales of natural gas. \n\nLG&#38;E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia. LG&#38;E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. Revenue from these activities is generated from tariffs approved by applicable regulatory authorities including the FERC, KPSC and VSCC. LG&#38;E and KU satisfy their performance obligations upon LG&#38;E's and KU's delivery of electricity and LG&#38;E's delivery of natural gas to customers. This revenue is recognized over-time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by LG&#38;E and KU. The amount of revenue recognized is the billed volume of electricity or natural gas delivered multiplied by a tariff rate per-unit of energy, plus any applicable fixed charges or additional regulatory mechanisms. Customers are billed monthly and outstanding amounts are typically due within 22 days of the date of the bill. Additionally, unbilled revenues are recognized as a result of customers' bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf delivered but not yet billed by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents LG&#38;E's and KU's transfer of electricity and LG&#38;E's transfer of natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per-unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as set by the respective regulatory body. \n\nLG&#38;E's and KU's customers generally have no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with these customers. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe following table reconciles \"Operating Revenues\" included in each Registrant's Statement of Income with revenues generated from contracts with customers for the years ended December &#160; 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU Operating Revenues (a) $ 7,902 &#160; $ 3,030 &#160; $ 1,798 &#160; $ 2,074 &#160; Revenues derived from: Alternative revenue programs (b) ( 92 ) ( 56 ) 9 &#160; 5 &#160; Other (c) ( 24 ) ( 14 ) ( 6 ) ( 4 ) Revenues from Contracts with Customers $ 7,786 &#160; $ 2,960 &#160; $ 1,801 &#160; $ 2,075 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 2021 PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU Operating Revenues (a) $ 5,783 &#160; $ 2,402 &#160; $ 1,569 &#160; $ 1,826 &#160; Revenues derived from: Alternative revenue programs (b) 77 &#160; 83 &#160; ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Other (c) ( 22 ) ( 3 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) Revenues from Contracts with Customers $ 5,838 &#160; $ 2,482 &#160; $ 1,558 &#160; $ 1,814 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 2020 PPL PPL Electric LG&#38;E KU Operating Revenues (a) $ 5,474 &#160; $ 2,331 &#160; $ 1,456 &#160; $ 1,690 &#160; Revenues derived from: Alternative revenue programs (b) ( 24 ) ( 12 ) ( 8 ) ( 4 ) Other (c) ( 21 ) ( 3 ) ( 7 ) ( 10 ) Revenues from Contracts with Customers $ 5,429 &#160; $ 2,316 &#160; $ 1,441 &#160; $ 1,676 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) PPL includes $ 1,038 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 of revenues from external customers reported by the Rhode Island Regulated segment. PPL Electric represents revenues from external customers reported by the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and LG&#38;E and KU, net of intercompany power sales and transmission revenues, represent revenues from external customers reported by the Kentucky Regulated segment. See Note 2 for additional information. \n\n(b) This line item shows the over/under collection of rate mechanisms deemed alternative revenue programs with over-collections of revenue shown as positive amounts in the table above and under collections as negative amounts. For PPL Electric, revenue in 2022 includes $ 74 million related to the \n\namortization of the regulatory liability primarily recorded in 2021 for a reduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity that is reflected in rates in 2022. Revenue in 2021 was reduced by $ 78 million for a reduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity. See Note 7 for additional information. \n\n(c) Represents additional revenues outside the scope of revenues from contracts with customers such as leases and other miscellaneous revenues. \n\nThe following table shows revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December &#160; 31: \n\n##TABLE_START Residential Commercial Industrial Other (a) Wholesale - municipality Wholesale - other (b) Transmission Revenues from Contracts with Customers PPL 2022 PA Regulated $ 1,647 &#160; $ 491 &#160; $ 85 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 683 &#160; $ 2,960 &#160; RI Regulated 299 &#160; 101 &#160; 9 &#160; 478 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 101 &#160; 988 &#160; KY Regulated 1,637 &#160; 1,068 &#160; 662 &#160; 323 &#160; 28 &#160; 97 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,815 &#160; Corp and Other &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23 &#160; Total PPL $ 3,583 &#160; $ 1,660 &#160; $ 756 &#160; $ 878 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 97 &#160; $ 784 &#160; $ 7,786 &#160; 2021 PA Regulated $ 1,299 &#160; $ 350 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 730 &#160; $ 2,482 &#160; RI Regulated &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; KY Regulated 1,416 &#160; 928 &#160; 586 &#160; 305 &#160; 24 &#160; 66 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,325 &#160; Corp and Other &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31 &#160; Total PPL $ 2,715 &#160; $ 1,278 &#160; $ 639 &#160; $ 386 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 66 &#160; $ 730 &#160; $ 5,838 &#160; 2020 PA Regulated $ 1,238 &#160; $ 314 &#160; $ 44 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 670 &#160; $ 2,316 &#160; RI Regulated &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; KY Regulated 1,347 &#160; 871 &#160; 538 &#160; 261 &#160; 20 &#160; 40 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,077 &#160; Corp and Other &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 36 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 36 &#160; Total PPL $ 2,585 &#160; $ 1,185 &#160; $ 582 &#160; $ 347 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ 40 &#160; $ 670 &#160; $ 5,429 &#160; PPL Electric 2022 $ 1,647 &#160; $ 491 &#160; $ 85 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 683 &#160; $ 2,960 &#160; 2021 $ 1,299 &#160; $ 350 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 730 &#160; $ 2,482 &#160; 2020 $ 1,238 &#160; $ 314 &#160; $ 44 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 670 &#160; $ 2,316 &#160; LG&#38;E 2022 $ 835 &#160; $ 551 &#160; $ 199 &#160; $ 141 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 75 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,801 &#160; 2021 $ 711 &#160; $ 473 &#160; $ 180 &#160; $ 145 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 49 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,558 &#160; 2020 $ 676 &#160; $ 444 &#160; $ 173 &#160; $ 114 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,441 &#160; KU 2022 $ 802 &#160; $ 517 &#160; $ 463 &#160; $ 182 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 83 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2,075 &#160; 2021 $ 705 &#160; $ 455 &#160; $ 406 &#160; $ 160 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 64 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,814 &#160; 2020 $ 671 &#160; $ 427 &#160; $ 365 &#160; $ 147 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ 46 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,676 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily includes revenues from pole attachments, street lighting, other public authorities and other non-core businesses. \n\n(b) Includes wholesale power and transmission revenues.

Preferred Securities \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock. No PPL preferred stock was issued or outstanding in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nRIE has $ 3 million of outstanding preferred stock.

No PPL Electric preferred stock was issued or outstanding in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\n(LG&#38;E) \n\nLG&#38;E is authorized to issue up to 1,720,000 shares of preferred stock at a $ 25 par value and 6,750,000 shares of preferred stock without par value. LG&#38;E had no preferred stock issued or outstanding in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\n(KU) \n\nKU is authorized to issue up to 5,300,000 shares of preferred stock and 2,000,000 shares of preference stock without par value. KU had no preferred or preference stock issued or outstanding in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\n5. Earnings Per Share \n\n(PPL) \n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by incremental shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the Treasury Stock Method. Incremental non-participating securities that have a dilutive impact are detailed in the table below. \n\nReconciliations of the amounts of income and shares of PPL common stock (in thousands) for the periods ended December 31, used in the EPS calculation are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Income (Numerator) &#160; &#160; &#160; Income from continuing operations after income taxes $ 714 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 640 &#160; Less amounts allocated to participating securities 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Income from continuing operations after income taxes available to PPL common shareowners - Basic and Diluted $ 713 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 639 &#160; Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) available to PPL common shareowners - Basic and Diluted $ 42 &#160; $ ( 1,498 ) $ 829 &#160; Net income (loss) attributable to PPL $ 756 &#160; $ ( 1,480 ) 1,469 &#160; Less amounts allocated to participating securities 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Net income (loss) available to PPL common shareowners - Basic and Diluted $ 755 &#160; $ ( 1,480 ) $ 1,468 &#160; Shares of Common Stock (Denominator) &#160; &#160; &#160; Weighted-average shares - Basic EPS 736,027 &#160; 762,902 &#160; 768,590 &#160; Add: Dilutive share-based payment awards (a) 875 &#160; 1,917 &#160; 794 &#160; Weighted-average shares - Diluted EPS 736,902 &#160; 764,819 &#160; 769,384 &#160; Basic EPS &#160; &#160; &#160; Available to PPL common shareowners: Income from continuing operations after income taxes $ 0.97 &#160; $ 0.03 &#160; $ 0.83 &#160; Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) 0.06 &#160; ( 1.96 ) 1.08 &#160; Net Income (Loss) available to PPL common shareowners $ 1.03 &#160; $ ( 1.93 ) $ 1.91 &#160; Diluted EPS &#160; &#160; &#160; Available to PPL common shareowners: Income from continuing operations after income taxes $ 0.96 &#160; $ 0.03 &#160; $ 0.83 &#160; Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) 0.06 &#160; ( 1.96 ) 1.08 &#160; Net Income (Loss) available to PPL common shareowners $ 1.02 &#160; $ ( 1.93 ) $ 1.91 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The Treasury Stock Method was applied to non-participating share-based payment awards. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, PPL issued common stock related to stock-based compensation plans as follows (in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Stock-based compensation plans (a) 124 &#160; 983 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes stock options exercised, vesting of performance units, vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and conversion of stock units granted to directors. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, the following shares (in thousands) were excluded from the computations of diluted EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Stock-based compensation awards 93 &#160; 1,783 &#160; 452 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n6. Income and Other Taxes \n\n(PPL) \n\n\"Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes\" is from domestic operations. \n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The provision for PPL's deferred income taxes for regulated assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles of the applicable jurisdiction. See Notes 1 and 7 for additional information. \n\nNet deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates of future taxable income. \n\nSignificant components of PPL's deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Deferred Tax Assets &#160; &#160; Deferred investment tax credits $ 29 &#160; $ 30 &#160; Regulatory liabilities 88 &#160; 94 &#160; Income taxes due to customers 448 &#160; 422 &#160; Accrued pension and postretirement costs 86 &#160; 75 &#160; State loss carryforwards 230 &#160; 483 &#160; Federal and state tax credit carryforwards 68 &#160; 15 &#160; Internal Revenue Code Section 197 intangibles (a) 85 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Leases 15 &#160; 67 &#160; Contributions in aid of construction 114 &#160; 120 &#160; Other 72 &#160; 84 &#160; Valuation allowances ( 213 ) ( 462 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,022 &#160; 928 &#160; Deferred Tax Liabilities &#160; &#160; Plant - net 3,609 &#160; 3,812 &#160; Regulatory assets 337 &#160; 180 &#160; Prepayments 46 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other 30 &#160; 75 &#160; Total deferred tax liabilities 4,022 &#160; 4,067 &#160; Net deferred tax liability $ 3,000 &#160; $ 3,139 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Certain of the RIE assets acquired in 2022 are treated as intangibles for tax purposes that are amortized over a 15 year period. PPL recorded deferred tax assets on these intangibles, which will reverse as tax deductions are taken. \n\nState deferred taxes are determined by entity and by jurisdiction. As a result, $ 6 million and $ 12 million of net deferred tax assets are shown as \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets for 2022 and 2021. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, PPL had the following loss and tax credit carryforwards, related deferred tax assets and valuation allowances recorded against the deferred tax assets: \n\n##TABLE_START Gross Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Expiration Loss and other carryforwards &#160; &#160; State net operating losses $ 5,830 &#160; $ 230 &#160; $ ( 213 ) 2023-2042 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Expiration Credit carryforwards &#160; &#160; Federal investment tax credit 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2042 Federal foreign tax credits 32 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2027 Federal - other 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2042 State recycling credit 12 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2028 State - other 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Indefinite ##TABLE_END \n\nValuation allowances have been established for the amount that, more likely than not, will not be realized.

See reconciliation of income tax table below. \n\n(b) In 2021, PPL recorded a $ 31 million increase in a valuation allowance on a state net operating loss carryforward in connection with the loss on extinguishment associated with a tender offer to purchase and retire PPL Capital Funding's outstanding Senior Notes. \n\n(c) In light of the disposition of PPL's U.K. utility business, there was a decrease in the valuation allowance of approximately $ 113 million. \n\nDetails of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to \"Income Before Income Taxes\" to income taxes for reporting purposes, and details of \"Taxes, other than income\" were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) &#160; &#160; &#160; Current - Federal $ ( 2 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 8 ) Current - State 24 &#160; 36 &#160; 24 &#160; Current - Foreign &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Total Current Expense (Benefit) 22 &#160; 34 &#160; 14 &#160; Deferred - Federal 122 &#160; 28 &#160; 135 &#160; Deferred - State 68 &#160; 105 &#160; 94 &#160; Deferred - Foreign (a) &#8212; &#160; 383 &#160; 101 &#160; Total Deferred Expense (Benefit), excluding operating loss carryforwards 190 &#160; 516 &#160; 330 &#160; Amortization of investment tax credit ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Tax expense (benefit) of operating loss carryforwards &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred - Federal 2 &#160; 12 &#160; 6 &#160; Deferred - State ( 10 ) ( 56 ) ( 33 ) Total Tax Expense (Benefit) of Operating Loss Carryforwards ( 8 ) ( 44 ) ( 27 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 201 &#160; $ 503 &#160; $ 314 &#160; Total income tax expense (benefit) - Federal $ 119 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 130 &#160; Total income tax expense (benefit) - State 82 &#160; 85 &#160; 85 &#160; Total income tax expense (benefit) - Foreign &#8212; &#160; 382 &#160; 99 &#160; Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 201 &#160; $ 503 &#160; $ 314 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The U.K. Finance Act 2021, formally enacted on June 10, 2021, increased the U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The primary impact of the corporation tax rate increase was an increase in deferred tax liabilities of the U.K. utility business, which was sold on June 14, 2021, and a corresponding deferred tax expense of $ 383 million, which was recognized in continuing operations in 2021. \n\nIn 2020, the U.K. Finance Act 2020 cancelled the tax rate reduction from 19% to 17%.

This amortization represents each year's refund amount, prior to a tax gross-up, to be paid to customers for previously collected deferred taxes at higher income tax rates. \n\n(b) On July 8, 2022, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Pennsylvania House Bill 1342 (H.B. 1342). Among other changes to the state tax code, the bill reduces the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% beginning January 1, 2023, and further reduces the rate annually by half a percentage point until the rate reaches 4.99% in 2031.

The income tax provisions for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU are calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement, which provides that taxable income be calculated as if each domestic subsidiary filed a separate consolidated return. PPL Electric or its subsidiaries indirectly or directly file tax returns in three major tax jurisdictions, and LG&#38;E and KU indirectly or directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions. With few exceptions, at December 31, 2022, these jurisdictions, as well as the tax years that are no longer subject to examination, were as follows. \n\n##TABLE_START PPL &#160; PPL Electric &#160; LG&#38;E &#160; KU U.S. (federal) 2018 and prior &#160; 2018 and prior &#160; 2018 and prior &#160; 2018 and prior Pennsylvania (state) 2017 and prior &#160; 2017 and prior &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Kentucky (state) 2017 and prior &#160; 2017 and prior &#160; 2017 and prior &#160; 2017 and prior U.K. (foreign) 2019 and prior &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOther \n\nNarragansett Electric Acquisition (PPL) \n\nThe acquisition of Narragansett Electric was deemed an asset acquisition for federal and state income tax purposes, as a result of PPL and National Grid making a tax election under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) &#167;338(h)(10). Accordingly, the tax bases of substantially all of the assets acquired were increased to fair market value, which equaled net book value, thereby eliminating the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. This election resulted in tax goodwill that will be amortized for tax purposes over 15 years. \n\nPennsylvania State Tax Reform (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nOn July 8, 2022, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Pennsylvania House Bill 1342 (H.B. 1342). Among other changes to the state tax code, the bill reduces the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% beginning January 1, 2023, and further reduces the rate annually by half a percentage point until the rate reaches 4.99% in 2031. \n\nGAAP requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary book-to-tax differences are expected to be realized or settled. In 2022, PPL and PPL Electric recorded an increase in regulatory liabilities of $ 270 million for the remeasurement of regulated accumulated deferred tax balances and a deferred tax benefit of $ 5 million and $ 9 million, respectively, associated with the remeasurement of non-regulated accumulated deferred income tax balances. The amounts recorded are estimates that will be updated quarterly to reflect revised forecast, actual activity, and applicable orders from regulatory authorities. \n\nInflation Reduction Act (All Registrants) \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA enacted a new 15% corporate \"book minimum tax,\" which is based on adjusted GAAP pre-tax income and is only applicable to corporations whose pre-tax income exceeds a certain threshold. PPL continues to assess the impacts of the IRA on the financial statements of PPL and the other Registrants and will monitor guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury in the future. In addition, the IRA enacted numerous new tax credits, largely associated with renewable energy. PPL continues to assess the applicability of these provisions to PPL and its subsidiaries. \n\n7. Utility Rate Regulation \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their rate-regulated utility operations. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to an item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date. \n\n(PPL) \n\nRIE is subject to the jurisdiction of the RIPUC, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, and the FERC. RIE operates under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff. RIE's base distribution rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base. Certain other recovery mechanisms exist to recover expenses and capital investments with a return on rate base separate from the base distribution rate case process. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nLG&#38;E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC. \n\nLG&#38;E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&#38;E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets. \n\n(PPL and KU) \n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets. \n\nKU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric is subject to the jurisdiction of the PAPUC and the FERC. PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on distribution rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions) and an automatic annual update. See \"Transmission Formula Rate\" below for additional information on this tariff. All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric's regulatory assets. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe following table provides information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility operations at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

$ 818 &#160; $ 1,029 &#160; $ 1,045 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) See &#8220;Regulatory Matters - Federal Matters - PPL Electric Transmission Formula Rate Return on Equity&#8221; below for additional information. \n\nFollowing is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables. Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in \"Regulatory Matters.\" \n\nDefined Benefit Plans \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nDefined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent prior service cost and net actuarial gains and losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and, generally, are amortized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants. These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is remeasured. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nAs a result of previous rate case settlements and orders, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&#38;E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated using a 15 -year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses and settlements are recorded as a regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2022, the balances were $ 107 million for PPL, $ 57 million for LG&#38;E and $ 50 million for KU. As of December 31, 2021, the balances were $ 98 million for PPL, $ 54 million for LG&#38;E and $ 44 million for KU. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nStorm Costs \n\nPPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU have the ability to request from the PAPUC, the KPSC and the VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once such authority is granted, LG&#38;E and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts. PPL Electric can recover qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over three years through the Storm Damage Expense Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred. Storm costs incurred in PPL Electric's territory from a March 2018 storm were amortized through 2021. LG&#38;E's and KU's regulatory assets for storm costs are being amortized through various dates ending in 2031. \n\nAs provided in the Amendment Settlement Agreement (ASA), RIE has the authority from the RIPUC to treat certain incremental O&#38;M expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once all expenses for the extraordinary storm have been finalized, RIE files a final accounting of those storm expenses with the RIPUC that is subject to review by the RIPUC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. \n\nUnamortized Loss on Debt \n\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt refinanced, reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). Such costs are being amortized through 2029 for PPL Electric, through 2042 for KU, and through 2044 for LG&#38;E. \n\nAccumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant \n\nRIE, LG&#38;E and KU charge costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred. \n\nPPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal. When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the costs as a regulatory asset. Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five -year period. \n\nNet Deferred Taxes \n\nRegulatory liabilities associated with net deferred taxes represent the future revenue impact from the adjustment of deferred income taxes required primarily for excess deferred taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, largely a result of the TCJA enacted in 2017. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nGeneration Supply Charge (GSC) \n\nThe GSC is a cost recovery mechanism that permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply service. The recovery includes charges for generation supply, as well as administration of the acquisition process. In addition, the GSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior periods is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent rate filing period. \n\nTransmission Service Charge (TSC) \n\nPPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers. PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PAPUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. \n\nTransmission Formula Rate \n\nPPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. \n\nStorm Damage Expense Rider (SDER) \n\nThe SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recover any differences from customers. In the 2015 rate case settlement approved by the PAPUC in November 2015, it was determined that reportable storm damage expenses to be recovered annually through base rates will be set at $ 20 million. The SDER will recover from or refund to customers the applicable expenses from reportable storms as compared to the $ 20 million recovered annually through base rates. \n\nAct 129 Compliance Rider \n\nIn compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric is currently in Phase IV of the energy efficiency and conservation plan which was approved in March 2021. Phase IV allows PPL Electric to recover the \n\nmaximum $ 313 million over the five -year period, June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2026. The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption. The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider. The actual Phase IV program costs are reconcilable after each 12-month period, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period. PPL Electric's Act 129 Phase III plan ended May 31, 2021 and any over-or under-recovery from customers related to Phase III will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period. \n\nSmart Meter Rider (SMR) \n\nAct 129 requires each electric distribution company (EDC) with more than 100,000 customers to have a PAPUC approved Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation Plan (SMP). As of December 31, 2019, PPL Electric replaced substantially all of its old meters with meters that meet the Act 129 requirements under its SMP. In accordance with Act 129, EDCs are able to recover the costs and earn a return on capital of providing smart metering technology. PPL Electric uses the SMR to recover the costs to implement its SMP. The SMR is a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior years is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarters. \n\nUniversal Service Rider (USR) \n\nThe USR provides for recovery of costs associated with universal service programs, OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program (WRAP), provided by PPL Electric to residential customers. OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households and WRAP provides low-income customers a means to reduce electric bills through energy saving methods. The USR rate is applied to residential customers who receive distribution service. The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year. \n\nTCJA Customer Refund \n\nAs a result of the reduced U.S federal corporate income tax rate as enacted by the TCJA, the PAPUC ruled that these tax benefits should be refunded to customers. Timing differences between the recognition of these tax benefits and the refund of the benefit to the customer creates a regulatory liability. PPL Electric's liability is being credited back to distribution customers through a temporary negative surcharge and remains in place until PPL Electric files and the PAPUC approves new base rates. The TCJA is reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nFuel Adjustment Clauses \n\nLG&#38;E's and KU's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in power purchases and the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LG&#38;E's and KU's rates. The KPSC requires formal reviews at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate, may conduct public hearings and reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months. \n\nKU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs and load for the fuel year (12 months ending March 31). The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the fuel year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior fuel year. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered or refunded within 12 months. \n\nEconomic Relief Billing Credit \n\nThe Economic Relief Billing Credit represents regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2021, that were returned to customers through September 30, 2022, as approved in the 2020 Kentucky rate case in recognition of the economic impact of COVID-19. \n\nAROs \n\nAs discussed in Note 1, for LG&#38;E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal. \n\nPower Purchase Agreement - OVEC \n\nAs a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition of LG&#38;E and KU, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LG&#38;E and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities. The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. LG&#38;E's and KU's customer rates continue to reflect the original contracts. See Notes 14 and 19 for additional discussion of the power purchase agreement. \n\nInterest Rate Swaps \n\nLG&#38;E's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures in 2033. \n\nTerminated Interest Rate Swaps \n\nNet realized gains and losses on all interest rate swaps are recovered through regulated rates. As such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and are primarily recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income over the life of the associated debt. \n\nPlant Outage Costs \n\nFrom July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2021, plant outage costs were normalized for ratemaking purposes based on an average level of expenses. Plant outage expenses that were greater or less than the average will be collected from or returned to customers, through future base rates. Effective July 1, 2021 under-recovered plant outage costs are being amortized through 2029 for LG&#38;E and KU. \n\n(PPL) \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nRIE evaluates open derivative instruments for regulatory deferral by determining if they are probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers through future rates. Derivative instruments that qualify for recovery are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities in the period in which the change occurs. The balance is reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year. \n\nEnergy Efficiency \n\nEnergy efficiency represents the difference between revenue billed to customers through RIE's energy efficiency charge and the costs of the RIE&#8217;s energy efficiency programs as approved by the RIPUC. \n\nThe energy efficiency charge is designed to collect the estimated costs of the RIE&#8217;s energy efficiency plan for the upcoming calendar year. The final annual over/under is reconciled in the next year's energy efficiency plan filing, as part of the reconciliation factor calculation. RIE may file to change the energy efficiency plan charge at any time should significant over-or under-recoveries occur. \n\nNet Metering \n\nNet metering deferral reflects the recovery mechanism for costs associated with customer-installed on-site generation facilities, including the costs of renewable generation credits. This surcharge provides RIE with a mechanism to recover such amounts. Net metering is reconcilable annually, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. \n\nRate Adjustment Mechanisms \n\nIn addition to commodity costs, RIE is subject to a number of additional rate adjustment mechanisms whereby an asset or liability is recognized resulting from differences between actual revenues and the underlying cost being recovered or differences between actual revenues and targeted amounts as approved by the RIPUC. The rate adjustment mechanisms are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers are to be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year. \n\nTaxes Recoverable through Future Rates \n\nTaxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that are anticipated to be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized. For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nEnvironmental Cost Recovery \n\nKentucky law permits LG&#38;E and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements, which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electricity generating facilities. The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period. The KPSC has authorized return on equity of 9.35 % for existing approved ECR projects. The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered or refunded within 12 months. \n\nRIE's rate plans provide for specific rate allowances for RIE's share of the estimated costs to investigate and perform certain remediation activities at sites with which it may be associated, with variances deferred for future recovery from, or return to, customers. RIE believes future costs, beyond the expiration of current rate plans, will continue to be recovered through rates. The regulatory asset represents the excess of amounts incurred for RIE's actual site investigation and remediation costs versus amounts received in rates. \n\n(PPL and LG&#38;E) \n\nGas Supply Clause \n\nLG&#38;E's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs and customer usage from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in LG&#38;E's rates, subject to approval by the KPSC. The gas supply clause also includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which allows LG&#38;E's rates to be adjusted annually to share savings between the actual cost of gas purchases and market indices, with the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending October 31). The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are typically recovered or refunded within 18 months. \n\nRegulatory Matters \n\nRhode Island Activities (PPL) \n\nRate Case proceedings \n\nAt its August 24, 2018 Open Meeting, and subsequently memorialized pursuant to Report and Order No. 23823 issued May 5, 2020, the RIPUC approved the terms of an ASA, reflecting an allowed return on equity (ROE) rate of 9.275 % based on a common equity ratio of approximately 51 %. RIE is currently in year four of the multi-year rate plan (Rate Plan). On June 30, 2021, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers consented to an open-ended extension of the term of the Rate \n\nPlan such that RIE was not required to file its next rate case in order for new rates take effect no later than September 1, 2022 as originally contemplated by the ASA. Pursuant to the settlement with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General in connection with the acquisition of RIE by PPL, RIE currently does not anticipate filing a new base rate case until at least three years following the closing of the acquisition on May 25, 2022. Pursuant to the open-ended extension, the Rate Year 3 level of base distribution rates under ASA will remain in effect and RIE will continue to operate under the current Rate Plan until a new Rate Plan is approved by the RIPUC. \n\nThe ASA includes additional provisions, including (i) an Electric Transportation Initiative (the ET Initiative) to facilitate the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and scaling of the market for EV charging equipment to advance Rhode Island's zero emission vehicles and greenhouse gas emissions policy goals, which the RIPUC is continuing to review in connection with certain underspending in the ET Initiative and the timing of crediting customers the deferral balance pursuant to the ASA, (ii) two energy storage demonstration projects, which are on track for timely completion, (iii) a new incentive-only performance incentive for System Efficiency: Annual Megawatt Capacity Savings, which sunset in 2021 and (iv) several additional metrics for tracking and reporting purposes only. The RIPUC discussed the ET Initiative at an Open Meeting on August 30, 2022, advising the Company to seek RIPUC authorization to continue the ET Initiative and/or to alter any of the targets established in the ASA for Rate Year 5 and beyond. No votes or official rulings were taken; however, based on this feedback, RIE has paused the ET programs in Rate Year 5. \n\nAdvanced Metering Functionality and Grid Modernization \n\nOn January 21, 2021, RIE filed its Updated Advance Metering Functionality (AMF) Business Case and Grid Modernization Plan (GMP) with the RIPUC in accordance with the ASA. The Updated AMF Business Case &#8211; a foundational component of the GMP &#8211; seeks approval to deploy smart meters throughout the service territory. Pursuant to the written order issued on July 14, 2021, the RIPUC stayed the AMF and GMP proceedings pending further consideration following the issuance of a final Order by the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers on the acquisition. RIE filed notice of withdrawal of the original Updated AMF Business Case and GMP with the RIPUC on September 12, 2022. RIE filed a new AMF Business Case with the RIPUC on November 18, 2022. The new AMF Business Case filing consists of a detailed proposal for full-scale deployment of AMF across its electric service territory. The proposal will enable significant customer and grid benefits in line with the state&#8217;s climate mandates. If approved, the program is estimated to cost $ 188 million on a net present value (NPV) basis and provide benefits of $ 729 million NPV over the 20-year project life, yielding a benefit-cost ratio of 3.9 %. RIE&#8217;s proposal represents an opportunity to deploy this foundational technology, which is a necessary first step to transforming Rhode Island&#8217;s electric distribution system. In its filing, RIE requested a RIPUC decision by June 2023; the RIPUC issued a revised procedural schedule for the AMF Business Case filing that provides for hearings on July 19-20, and July 25-27, 2023. In addition, the RIPUC will hold a public comment hearing on February 28, 2023, and technical sessions on February 22, 2023, March 2, 2023, April 18, 2023 and May 10, 2023. RIE filed a new GMP with the RIPUC on December 30, 2022. The new GMP filing consists of a holistic suite of grid modernization investments that will provide RIE with the tools and capability to manage the electric distribution system more granularly considering a range of distributed energy resources adoption levels, accelerated by Rhode Island&#8217;s ambitious climate mandates, while at the same time maintaining a safe and reliable electric distribution system. The GMP is an informational guidance document that supports the foundational grid modernization investments proposed in RIE&#8217;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Electric Infrastructure, Safety and Reliability (ISR) Plan and will support additional grid modernization investments to be proposed in future electric ISR plans. Consequently, RIE is not requesting approval from the RIPUC for any specific investments or seeking any cost recovery as part of this GMP; rather, RIE requested the RIPUC issue an order affirming RIE&#8217;s compliance with its obligation to file a GMP that meets the requirements of the ASA. The RIPUC has not yet established a procedural schedule for the GMP filing. \n\nCOVID-19 Deferral Filing \n\nOn April 30, 2021, RIE filed a petition for approval to recognize regulatory assets related to COVID-19 impacts (RIPUC Docket No. 5154). In its petition, RIE seeks the RIPUC's authorization to create regulatory assets and consideration of future cost recovery for the following COVID-19 costs: (1) the increased cost of customer accounts receivable that RIE will be unable to collect as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the executive orders and RIPUC orders restricting RIE's collection activities as a result of the pandemic, which will result in increased net charge-offs; (2) lost revenue from unassessed late payment charges; and (3) charges to RIE for other fees that RIE has waived pursuant to the RIPUC's orders in RIPUC Docket No. 5022. The RIPUC has not taken any action on the filing to date and RIE is continuing to monitor the docket. RIE is evaluating its request to create a regulatory asset for COVID-19-related bad debt expense to consider the impact, if any, of the proposed arrearage forgiveness sought in RIE&#8217;s Petition to Forgive Certain Arrearage Balances for Low-Income and Protected Customers in Docket No. 22-08-GE, which RIE filed with the RIPUC to fulfill its obligations under PPL's settlement with the Rhode Island Attorney General. \n\nFY 2023 Gas ISR Plan \n\nAt an Open Meeting on March 29, 2022, the RIPUC conditionally approved RIE&#8217;s FY 2023 Gas ISR Plan and associated revenue requirement, subject to further review regarding RIE&#8217;s Proactive Main Replacement Program and its decision to reconstruct and purchase heating and pressure regulation equipment located at RIE&#8217;s Wampanoag and Tiverton take stations. The RIPUC held an Open Meeting on September 13, 2022, and issued its Order on November 18. 2022 regarding the Proactive Main Replacement Program and made the following rulings: (1) commencing with the Gas ISR plan to be filed in this calendar year 2022 (prospectively), new main constructed to replace leak prone pipe will not be considered used and useful, and therefore not eligible for rate base treatment, until the related old main is abandoned; and (2) approved the proactive main replacement revenue requirement set forth in the FY2023 Gas ISR plan. Also, the RIPUC directed RIE to submit prefiled testimony on the issue of its replacement of heating and pressure regulation facilities at the Wampanoag and Tiverton take stations and to address three issues, specifically: (i) a cost-benefit analysis arising from RIE's decision to take ownership of the reconstructed take station equipment; (ii) the potential that the benefits derived from the reconstruction and ownership transfer of the take station equipment will not be realized due to the future use of hydrogen or abandonment of the gas system; and (iii) the depreciation and accounting treatment of the reconstructed take station equipment. RIE filed this testimony with the RIPUC on May 16, 2022 and this issue is still pending before the RIPUC. \n\nFY 2024 Gas ISR Plan \n\nOn December 23, 2022, RIE filed its FY 2024 Gas ISR Plan with the RIPUC. To transition the filing of the ISR plan from National Grid&#8217;s fiscal year (April 1 &#8211; March 31) to PPL&#8217;s fiscal year (January 1 &#8211; December 31), RIE proposed a one-time 21-month plan to cover the period from April 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024; subsequent ISR plans would then align with PPL's fiscal year. The 21-month plan includes $ 389 million of capital investment spend and would result in the abandonment of approximately 123 miles of leak-prone pipe as well as continue significant investment into our custody transfer stations, pressure regulating facilities, and peak shaving plants/operations. The RIPUC directed RIE and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers to brief the question of how the 21-month plan, which spans two fiscal years, is consistent with the Decoupling Act (R.I. Gen. Laws Section 39-1-27.7.1) on or before January 17, 2023. At its January 20, 2023 Open Meeting, the RIPUC directed RIE to file supplemental budget and rate schedules to reflect an April 1 to March 31 fiscal year, consistent with past ISR plan filings and the existing tariff. The supplemental budget that was filed with the RIPUC on January 27, 2023 includes $ 187 million of capital investment spend. The supplemental rate schedules were filed on February 3, 2023. The RIPUC has scheduled a hearing on the plan on March 14, 2023 and March 15, 2023, and is expected to render a decision by the end of March for rates effective April 1, 2023. \n\nFY 2024 Electric ISR Plan \n\nOn December 23, 2022, RIE filed its FY 2024 Electric ISR Plan with the RIPUC. To transition the filing of the ISR plan from National Grid&#8217;s fiscal year (April 1 &#8211; March 31) to PPL's fiscal year (January 1 &#8211; December 31), RIE proposed a one-time 21-month plan to cover the period from April 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024; subsequent ISR plans would then align with PPL&#8217;s fiscal year. The 21-month plan includes $ 328 million of capital investment spend; $ 24 million of vegetation management O&#38;M expenses; and $ 6 million of Other O&#38;M expenses. This year's Electric ISR Plan includes $ 82 million for capital investment spend included in RIE&#8217;s recently filed GMP, along with investments stemming from the completion of RIE&#8217;s area studies. The RIPUC directed RIE and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers to brief the question of how the 21-month Plan, which spans two fiscal years, is consistent with the Decoupling Act (R.I. Gen. Laws Section 39-1-27.7.1) on or before January 17, 2023. At its January 20, 2023 Open Meeting, the RIPUC directed RIE to file supplemental budget and rate schedules to reflect an April 1 to March 31 fiscal year, consistent with past ISR plan filings and the existing tariff. The supplemental budget filed with the RIPUC on January 27, 2023 includes $ 176 million of capital investment spend, $ 14 million of vegetation management O&#38;M spend and $ 3 million of Other O&#38;M spend. The supplemental rate schedules were filed on February 3, 2023. The RIPUC has scheduled a hearing on March 8-9, 2023 and March 21-22, 2023 and is expected to render a decision by the end of March for rates effective April 1, 2023. \n\nKentucky Activities (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nCPCN \n\nOn December 15, 2022, LG&#38;E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction of two 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine facilities, one at LG&#38;E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky and the other at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky, including on-site natural gas and electric transmission construction associated with those facilities and site compatibility certificates. LG&#38;E and KU also applied \n\nfor a CPCN to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, and for a CPCN to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky. LG&#38;E and KU further applied for a CPCN to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station and for approval of their proposed 2024-2030 DSM programs. The plan includes adding 14 new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs, which would reduce LG&#38;E's and KU's overall need by approximately 100 MW each. Finally, LG&#38;E and KU requested a declaratory order to confirm that their entry into non-firm energy-only power-purchase agreements for the output of four solar photovoltaic facilities with a combined capacity of 637 MW does not require KPSC approval and that LG&#38;E and KU may recover the costs of the solar PPAs through their fuel adjustment clause mechanisms as previously approved for a prior solar PPA. LG&#38;E and KU plan to accrue AFUDC on the constructed NGCCs, solar facility in Mercer County, Kentucky and the battery energy storage system facility and have requested regulatory asset treatment to recover the financing costs of these projects. \n\nThe new NGCC would be jointly owned by LG&#38;E ( 31 %) and KU ( 69 %) and the solar units would be jointly owned by LG&#38;E ( 37 %) and KU ( 63 %), the battery storage unit would be owned by LG&#38;E, and the proposed PPA transactions and DSM programs would be entered into or conducted jointly by LG&#38;E and KU, consistent with LG&#38;E and KU's shared dispatch, cost allocation, tariff or other frameworks. \n\nThe filing also notes planned retirement dates for certain existing coal-fired generation units, including Mill Creek 1 ( 300 MW) in 2024 and E.W. Brown 3 ( 412 MW) in 2028 , and updates and advances the planned retirement dates for Mill Creek 2 ( 297 MW) to 2027 and Ghent 2 ( 486 MW) to 2028 . LG&#38;E and KU anticipate the recovery of associated retirement costs, including the remaining net book value, for these coal-fired generating units through the RAR or other rate mechanisms. \n\nThe KPSC accepted the filing as of January 6, 2023 and has indicated its intention to issue an order on all issues by November 6, 2023. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters. \n\nPennsylvania Activities (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPAPUC investigation into billing issues \n\nOn January 31, 2023, the PAPUC initiated an investigation focused on billing issues related to estimated, irregular bills and customer service concerns following customer complaints, which for many customers were driven by increased prices for electricity supply. Certain bills issued during the time period of December 20, 2022 through January 9, 2023 were estimated due to a technical issue that prevented PPL Electric from providing actual collected meter data to customer facing and other internal systems. Customers also reported difficulties accessing PPL Electric&#8217;s website and contacting the customer service call center. The PAPUC&#8217;s Bureau of Investigation &#38; Enforcement has directed PPL Electric to respond to certain inquiries and document requests. PPL Electric plans to submit its responses to the information request and cooperate fully with the investigation. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter. \n\nAct 129 \n\n&#160; \n\nAct 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) to meet, by specified dates, specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act&#8239;129 are subject to significant penalties. PPL&#8239;Electric filed with the PAPUC its Act 129 Phase IV Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan on November 30, 2020,&#8239;for the five-year period starting June 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2026.&#8239;PPL Electric's Phase IV Act 129 Plan was approved by the PAPUC at its March 25, 2021, public meeting. \n\nAct 129 also requires EDCs to act as a default service provider (DSP), which provides electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PAPUC-approved default service procurement plan. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan. \n\nFederal Matters \n\nPPL Electric Transmission Formula Rate Return on Equity (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nIn May 2020, PP&#38;L Industrial Customer Alliance (PPLICA) filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that PPL Electric's base ROE of 11.18 % used to determine PPL Electric's formula transmission rate was unjust and unreasonable. In August 2021, PPL Electric entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement) with PPLICA and all other parties, including intervenors. The key aspects of the Settlement included changes to PPL Electric's base ROE. The settlement was approved by the FERC in November 2021. The interim rates reflecting the agreed-to-base ROE in the Settlement were effective December 1, 2021. \n\nIn 2021, PPL Electric recorded a revenue reduction of $ 78 million ($ 55 million after-tax), of which $ 73 million ($ 52 million after-tax) represented revenue subject to refund for the period May 21, 2020 through November 30, 2021. The reduction recorded included $ 28 million ($ 20 million after-tax) related to the period from May 21, 2020 to December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, PPL and PPL Electric had a regulatory liability on the Balance Sheet of $ 73 million, which represented revenue subject to refund based on the difference between charges that were calculated using the ROE in effect at the time and charges calculated using the revised ROE provided for in the Settlement, plus interest at the FERC interest rate. The total balance at December 31, 2021, plus additional interest recorded was refunded to customers by May 31, 2022. \n\nFERC Transmission Rate Filing (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nIn 2018, LG&#38;E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&#38;E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&#38;E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&#38;E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&#38;E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&#38;E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&#38;E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&#38;E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&#38;E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. On August 4, 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. LG&#38;E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings at the FERC on remand. LG&#38;E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms and such rate recovery would be anticipated to be adjusted consistent with potential changes or terminations of the waivers and credits, as such become effective. \n\nRecovery of Transmission Costs (PPL) \n\nUntil December 2022, RIE's transmission facilities were operated in combination with the transmission facilities of National Grid's New England affiliates, Massachusetts Electric Company (MECO) and NEP, as a single integrated system with NEP designated as the combined operator. As of January 1, 2023, RIE operates its own transmission facilities. NE-ISO allocates RIE&#8217;s costs among transmission customers in New England, in accordance with the ISO Open Access Transmission Tariff (ISO-NE OATT). \n\nAccording to the FERC orders, RIE is compensated for its actual monthly transmission costs, with its authorized maximum ROE of 11.74 % on its transmission assets. The amount remitted by NEP to RIE for the year ended December 31. 2022 was $ 122 million. \n\nThe ROE for transmission rates under the ISO-NE OATT is the subject of four complaints that are pending before the FERC. On October 16, 2014, the FERC issued an order on the first complaint, Opinion No. 531-A, resetting the base ROE applicable to transmission assets under the ISO-NE OATT from 11.14 % to 10.57 % effective as of October 16, 2014 and establishing a maximum ROE of 11.74 %. On April 14, 2017, this order was vacated and remanded by the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals). After the remand, the FERC issued an order on October 16, 2018 applicable to all four pending cases where it proposed a new base ROE methodology that, with subsequent input and support from the New England Transmission Owners (NETO), yielded a base ROE of 10.41 %. Subsequent to the FERC's October 2018 order in the New England Transmission Owners cases, the FERC further refined its ROE methodology in another proceeding and has applied that refined methodology to transmission owners&#8217; ROEs in other jurisdictions, and the NETOs filed further information in the New England matters to distinguishing their case. Those determinations in other jurisdictions are currently on appeal before the Court of Appeals. The proceeding and the final base rate ROE determination in the New England matters remain open, pending a final order from the FERC. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and an estimate of the impact cannot be determined. \n\nOther \n\nPurchase of Receivables Programs \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nIn accordance with a PAPUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative electricity suppliers at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, PPL Electric purchased $ 1.3 billion, $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers. \n\n(PPL) \n\nAt its July 27, 2021, December 21, 2021, and March 2, 2022 Open Meetings, the RIPUC approved various components of a Purchase of Receivables Program (POR) in Rhode Island for effect on April 1, 2022. Municipal aggregators and non-regulated power producers (collectively, Competitive Suppliers) are eligible to participate in accordance with RIE&#8217;s approved electric tariffs for municipal aggregation and non-regulated power producers. Under the POR program, RIE will purchase the Competitive Suppliers' accounts receivables, including existing receivables, at discounted rates, regardless of whether RIE has collected the owed monies from customers. The program is intended to make RIE whole through the implementation of a discount rate or Standard Complete Bill Percentage (SCBP) paid by Competitive Suppliers. RIE will calculate the SCBP for each customer class and file the calculations with the RIPUC for review and approval by February 15 of each year. Once approved, the SCBP will be effective beginning on April 1 for a one-year period. \n\n8. Financing Activities \n\nCredit Arrangements and Short-term Debt \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the credit facilities and commercial paper programs of PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU also apply to PPL.

The aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $ 7.1 billion and $ 6.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n(b) Includes PPL Electric's series of senior secured bonds that secure its obligations to make payments with respect to each series of Pollution Control Bonds that were issued by the LCIDA and the PEDFA on behalf of PPL Electric. These senior secured bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such Pollution Control Bonds. These senior secured bonds were issued under PPL Electric's 2001 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in (a) above. The tax-exempt revenue bonds are subject to mandatory redemption upon determination that the interest rate on the bonds would be included in the holders' gross income for federal tax purposes. \n\nIncludes $ 250 million of notes that may be called at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. \n\n(c) Includes LG&#38;E's and KU's series of first mortgage bonds that were issued to the respective trustees of tax-exempt revenue bonds to secure its respective obligations to make payments with respect to each series of bonds. The first mortgage bonds were issued in the same principal amounts, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such tax-exempt revenue bonds. These first mortgage bonds were issued under the LG&#38;E 2010 Mortgage Indenture and the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in (a) above. The related tax-exempt revenue bonds were issued by various governmental entities, principally counties in Kentucky, on behalf of LG&#38;E and KU. The related revenue bond documents allow LG&#38;E and KU to convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate, term rate of at least one year or, in some cases, an auction rate or a LIBOR index rate. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LG&#38;E and KU that were in a term rate mode totaled $ 782 million for PPL, comprised of $ 473 million and $ 309 million for LG&#38;E and KU. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LG&#38;E and KU that were in a variable rate mode totaled $ 66 million and $ 33 million for LG&#38;E and KU.

PPL's subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL. Accordingly, creditors of PPL may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL's subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL's creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. Similarly, PPL is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries, nor are its subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another. Accordingly, creditors of PPL's subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL or its other subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL or its other subsidiaries to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. \n\nSimilarly, the subsidiaries of PPL Electric are each separate legal entities. These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL Electric. Accordingly, creditors of PPL Electric may not satisfy its debts from the assets of its subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. Similarly, PPL Electric is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries, nor are its subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another. Accordingly, creditors of these subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL Electric (or its other subsidiaries) absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL Electric or any such other subsidiary to pay such creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. \n\n(PPL) \n\nEquity Securities \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nIn August 2021, PPL's Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $ 3 billion of PPL common shares. In 2021, PPL repurchased approximately $ 1 billion of PPL common shares. There were no share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2022. Any additional amounts to be repurchased pursuant to this authority will depend on various factors, including PPL&#8217;s share price and market conditions. PPL may purchase shares on each trading day subject to market conditions and principles of best execution. \n\nDistributions and Related Restrictions \n\nIn November 2022, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 3, 2023, at 22.50 cents per share (equivalent to 0.90 cents per annum). On February 17, 2023, PPL announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 24.00 cents per share, payable April 3, 2023, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2023. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. \n\nNeither PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067. At December 31, 2022, no interest payments were deferred. \n\nRIE has $ 3 million of certain issues of non-participating cumulative preferred stock outstanding that can be redeemed at the option of RIE. There are no mandatory redemption provisions on the cumulative preferred stock. Dividends on the cumulative preferred stock accrue quarterly and are prior to any dividends on the common stock of RIE. Pursuant to the preferred stock arrangement, as long as any preferred stock is outstanding, certain restrictions on payment of common stock dividends would come into effect if the common stock equity of RIE was, or by reason of payment of such dividends became, less than 25% of total capitalization of RIE. RIE was current on the preferred stock dividends and was in compliance with this covenant and accordingly, was not restricted as to the payment of common stock dividends under the foregoing provisions as of December 31, 2022. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL's dividends to its common shareholders. The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. LG&#38;E, KU and PPL Electric are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in capital account.\" The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act. LG&#38;E, KU and PPL Electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes. In February 2012, LG&#38;E and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for PPL's 2010 acquisition of LG&#38;E and KU. In May 2012, the FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30 % of total capitalization. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, net assets of $ 1.4 billion for LG&#38;E and $ 1.9 billion for KU were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $ 1.8 billion for LG&#38;E and $ 2.1 billion for KU were available for payment of dividends to LKE. LG&#38;E and KU believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement. In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the VSCC. There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LG&#38;E and KU, or under Pennsylvania law applicable to PPL Electric. However, orders from the KPSC require LG&#38;E and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amounts to PPL. \n\n&#160; \n\n9. Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures \n\n(PPL) \n\nAcquisitions \n\nAcquisition of Narragansett Electric \n\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S., a subsidiary of National Grid plc (the Acquisition). Narragansett Electric, whose service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island, is primarily engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas. The Acquisition expands PPL's portfolio of regulated natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution assets, has improved PPL's credit metrics and is expected to enhance long term earnings growth. Following the closing of the Acquisition, Narragansett Electric provides services doing business under the name Rhode Island Energy (RIE). \n\nThe consideration for the Acquisition consisted of approximately $ 3.8 billion in cash and approximately $ 1.5 billion of long-term debt assumed through the transaction. The fair value of the consideration paid for Narragansett Electric was as follows (in billions): \n\n##TABLE_START Aggregate enterprise consideration $ 5.3 &#160; Less: fair value of assumed long-term debt outstanding 1.5 &#160; Total cash consideration $ 3.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $ 3.8 billion total cash consideration paid was funded with proceeds from PPL's 2021 sale of its U.K. utility business. \n\nIn connection with the Acquisition, National Grid USA Service Company, Inc., National Grid U.S. and Narragansett Electric have entered into a transition services agreement (TSA), pursuant to which National Grid has agreed to provide certain transition services to Narragansett Electric to facilitate the transition of the operation of Narragansett Electric to PPL following the Acquisition, as agreed upon in the Narragansett SPA. The TSA is for an initial two-year term and is subject to extension as necessary to complete the successful transition. TSA costs of $ 123 million were incurred for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022. \n\nAcquisition Approval \n\nThe Acquisition required certain approvals or waivers, including, among others, approval of National Grid USA's shareholders, authorizations or waivers from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the FERC, as well as review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. All such approvals were received prior to closing of the Acquisition. \n\nCommitments to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island \n\nAs a condition to the Acquisition, PPL made certain commitments to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island. As a result: \n\n&#8226; RIE provided a credit to all its electric and natural gas distribution customers in the total amount of $ 50 million ($ 40 million net of tax benefit). Based on the relative number of electric distribution customers and natural gas distribution customers as of November 1, 2022, RIE refunded, in the form of a bill credit, $ 33 million to electric customers and $ 17 million to natural gas customers of amounts collected from customers since the Acquisition date. Each electric customer received the same credit, and each natural gas customer received the same credit. A reduction of revenue and a regulatory liability of $ 50 million for the amounts refunded were recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. These credits were issued during the fourth quarter of 2022. The amounts refunded will not impact RIE's earnings sharing regulatory mechanism. \n\n&#8226; RIE forgave approximately $ 44 million ($ 21 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts) in arrearages for low-income and protected residential customers, which represents 100% of the arrearages over 90 days for those customers as of March 31, 2022. PPL deemed these accounts uncollectible and fully reserved for them as of September 30, 2022, resulting in an increase to \"Other operations and maintenance expense\" on the Statement of Income of $ 23 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; RIE will not file a base rate case seeking an increase in base distribution rates for natural gas and/or electric service sooner than three years from the Acquisition date, and RIE will not submit a request for a change in base rates unless and until there is at least twelve months of operating experience under PPL's exclusive leadership and after the TSA with National Grid terminates. \n\n&#8226; RIE will forgo potential recovery of any and all transition costs which PPL estimates will be approximately $ 408 million through June 30, 2024, and includes (1) the installation of certain information technology systems; (2) modification and enhancements to physical facilities in Rhode Island; and (3) incurring costs related to severance payments, communications and branding changes, and other transition related costs. These costs, which are being expensed as incurred, were $ 181 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; RIE will not seek to recover any transaction costs related to the Acquisition, which were $ 27 million through December 31, 2022, including $ 18 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 recorded in \"Other operations and maintenance\" on the Statement of Income. \n\n&#8226; RIE will not seek to recover in rates any markup charged by National Grid U.S. and/or its affiliates under the TSA. These amounts were $ 3 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; In June 2022, RIE expensed $ 20 million of regulatory assets as of the Acquisition date for the Gas Business Enablement (GBE) project and for certain Cybersecurity/IT investments related to GBE. The expense was recorded to \"Other operations and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. RIE will not seek to recover these regulatory assets from customers in any future proceedings. \n\n&#8226; RIE will exclude all goodwill from the ratemaking capital structure. \n\n&#8226; RIE will hold harmless Rhode Island customers from any changes to Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) as a result of the Acquisition. RIE reserves the right to seek rate adjustments based on future changes to ADIT that are not related to the Acquisition. \n\n&#8226; RIE will not increase its revenue requirement to a level higher than what would exist in the absence of the Acquisition as a result of any restatement of pension and other post-retirement benefits plan assets and liabilities to fair value after the close of the Acquisition. \n\n&#8226; Rhode Island Holdings contributed $ 2.5 million to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation's Renewable Energy Fund and will not use any of the $ 2.5 million to meet its pre-existing renewable energy credit goals in Rhode Island or any other state. This contribution was made during the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in \"Other Income (Expense)\" on the Statement of Income. \n\n&#8226; RIE will make available up to $ 2.5 million for the Rhode Island Attorney General to utilize as needed in evaluating PPL's report on RIE's specific decarbonization goals to support Rhode Island's 2021 Act on Climate or to assess the future of the gas distribution business in Rhode Island. This amount was accrued during the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statement of Income. \n\n&#8226; Various other operational and reporting commitments have been established. \n\nPurchase Price Allocation \n\nThe operations of Narragansett Electric are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. The carrying value of Narragansett Electric&#8217;s assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting and cost recovery provisions provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of net assets and liabilities included in rate base. As such, the fair values of these assets and liabilities equal their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, nor the unaudited pro forma financial information presented below, reflect any adjustments related to these amounts. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was $ 1,586 million, which has been recorded as goodwill. PPL has elected to not reflect the effects of purchase accounting in the separate financial statements of RIE or PPL's Rhode Island Regulated segment. Accordingly, the Rhode Island Regulated segment includes $ 725 million of acquired legacy goodwill. The remaining excess purchase price of $ 861 million is included in PPL's Corporate and Other category for segment reporting purposes. The goodwill reflects the value paid for the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of PPL to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of those growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows. The tax goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes over a 15 year period, and as such, deferred taxes will be recorded as the tax deductions are taken. \n\nThe table below shows the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed that were recorded in PPL&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the Acquisition date. The allocation is subject to change during the one-year measurement period as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at closing. As a result, the amount of goodwill included below may change by a material amount as PPL finalizes the allocation of the purchase price.

Leases \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nLG&#38;E and KU have entered into various operating leases primarily for office space, vehicles and railcars. The leases generally have fixed payments with expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2040, some of which have options to extend the leases from one year to ten years and some have options to terminate at LG&#38;E's and KU's discretion. \n\nPPL has also entered into various operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space. These leases generally have fixed payments with expiration dates ranging from 2024 through 2030. RIE has various operating leases, primarily related to a transmission line, buildings, land, and fleet vehicles used to support the electric and gas operations, with lease terms ranging between 1 and 50 years. In measuring lease liabilities, the Company excludes variable lease payments, other than those that \n\ndepend on an index or rate, or are in substance fixed payments, and includes lease payments made at or before the commencement date. The variable lease payments were not material for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nPPL Electric also has operating leases which do not have a significant impact to its operations. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nLessee Transactions \n\nThe following table provides the components of lease cost for the Registrants' operating leases for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL Lease cost: &#160; Operating lease cost $ 20 &#160; $ 24 &#160; $ 28 &#160; Short-term lease cost 6 &#160; 6 &#160; 7 &#160; Total lease cost $ 26 &#160; $ 30 &#160; $ 35 &#160; LG&#38;E Lease cost: Operating lease cost $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 8 &#160; Short-term lease cost 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Total lease cost $ 7 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 9 &#160; KU Lease cost: Operating lease cost $ 9 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 13 &#160; Short-term lease cost 2 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Total lease cost $ 11 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 14 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides other key information related to the Registrants' operating leases at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 26 &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 24 &#160; Right-of-use asset obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 15 &#160; 12 &#160; 17 &#160; LG&#38;E Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 8 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 7 &#160; Right-of-use asset obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 4 &#160; 4 &#160; 6 &#160; KU Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 12 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 11 &#160; Right-of-use asset obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 5 &#160; 7 &#160; 9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides the total future minimum rental payments for operating leases, as well as a reconciliation of these undiscounted cash flows to the lease liabilities recognized on the Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START PPL LG&#38;E KU 2023 $ 24 $ 6 $ 9 2024 17 5 7 2025 12 3 4 2026 5 1 1 2027 4 1 &#8212; Thereafter 7 &#8212; &#8212; Total $ 69 $ 16 $ 21 \n\nWeighted-average discount rate \n\n3.1 % 3.17 % 3.4 % Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 4 3 3 Current lease liabilities (a) $ 22 $ 6 $ 8 Non-current lease liabilities (a) 42 9 12 Right-of-use assets (b) 60 13 19 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Current lease liabilities are included in \" Other Current Liabilities \" on the Balance Sheets.

The leases were operating leases and expired in 2021. Payments were allocated among lease and non-lease components as stated in the agreements. Lease payments were fixed or determined based on the amount of refined coal used in electricity generation at the facility. Payments received were primarily recorded as a regulatory liability and amortized in accordance with regulatory approvals. There are certain leases in which RIE is the lessor.

Stock-Based Compensation \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nUnder the SIP and the ICPKE (together, the Plans), restricted shares of PPL common stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of PPL, PPL Electric and other affiliated companies. Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation Committee of the PPL Board of Directors, in the case of the SIP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council (CLC), in the case of the ICPKE. \n\nThe following table details the award limits under each of the Plans. \n\n##TABLE_START Total Plan Annual Grant Limit Total As % of Outstanding Annual Grant Annual Grant Limit For Individual Participants - Performance Based Awards Award Limit PPL Common Stock On First Day of Limit Options For awards denominated in For awards denominated in Plan (Shares) Each Calendar Year (Shares) shares (Shares) cash (in dollars) SIP 15,000,000 &#160; &#160; 2,000,000 &#160; 750,000 &#160; $ 15,000,000 &#160; ICPKE 14,199,796 &#160; 2 &#160; % 3,000,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAny portion of these awards that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year. If any award lapses, the rights of the participant terminate, or, with respect to certain awards, is forfeited, and the shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award are again available for grant. Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the form of authorized \n\nand unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL or PPL common stock purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws. \n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nRestricted stock units represent the right to receive shares of PPL common stock in the future, generally three years after the date of grant, in an amount based on the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant. \n\nUnder the SIP, each restricted stock unit entitles the grant recipient to accrue additional restricted stock units equal to the amount of quarterly dividends paid on PPL stock. These additional restricted stock units are deferred and payable in shares of PPL common stock at the end of the restriction period. Dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards granted under the ICPKE are currently paid in cash when dividends are declared by PPL. \n\nThe fair value of restricted stock units granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the restriction period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value of restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. Recipients of restricted stock units granted under the ICPKE may also be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the award is forfeited. Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees. Restrictions lapse on restricted stock units fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. \n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL $ 27.52 &#160; $ 28.00 &#160; $ 35.30 &#160; PPL Electric 26.66 &#160; 27.96 &#160; 35.37 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRestricted stock unit activity for 2022 was: \n\n##TABLE_START Restricted Shares/Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share PPL &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period 1,004,583 &#160; $ 31.19 &#160; Granted 620,708 &#160; 27.52 &#160; Vested ( 427,095 ) 31.55 &#160; Forfeited ( 15,779 ) 29.61 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 1,182,417 &#160; 29.16 &#160; PPL Electric &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period 131,287 &#160; $ 31.50 &#160; Transfer between registrants ( 30,353 ) 30.03 &#160; Granted 51,832 &#160; 26.66 &#160; Vested ( 41,233 ) 32.19 &#160; Forfeited ( 1,747 ) 32.19 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 109,786 &#160; 28.91 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSubstantially all restricted stock unit awards are expected to vest. \n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock units vesting for the years ended December 31 was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL $ 12 &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ 19 &#160; PPL Electric 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPerformance Units - Total Shareowner Return \n\nPerformance units based on relative Total Shareowner Return (TSR) are intended to encourage and reward future corporate performance. Performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable performance goal. Performance is determined based on TSR during a three -year performance period. At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL's performance to the TSR of the companies included in the PHLX Utility Sector Index. Awards are payable on a graduated basis based on thresholds that measure PPL's performance relative to peers that comprise the applicable index on which each year's awards are measured. Awards can be paid up to 200 % of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, TSR performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, one year or more from commencement of the performance period, disability or death of an employee. \n\nThe fair value of TSR performance units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a one -year period, the minimum vesting period required for an employee to be entitled to payout of the awards with no proration. For employees who are not retirement-eligible, compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the three -year performance period or the period until the employee is retirement-eligible, with a minimum vesting and recognition period of one -year. If an employee retires before the one-year vesting period, the performance units are forfeited. Performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. \n\nThe fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life. The stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group. The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit. Volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and the companies in the index group. PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards. \n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the model were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Expected stock volatility 22.79 % 27.81 % 15.64 % Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years ##TABLE_END\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of TSR performance units granted was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL $ 34.27 &#160; $ 32.44 &#160; $ 37.63 &#160; PPL Electric 34.42 &#160; 32.92 &#160; 38.64 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTSR performance unit activity for 2022 was: \n\n##TABLE_START TSR Performance Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share PPL &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period 633,773 &#160; $ 34.68 &#160; Granted 298,795 &#160; 34.27 &#160; Forfeited (a) ( 245,861 ) 35.48 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 686,707 &#160; 34.21 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START TSR Performance Units Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share PPL Electric &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period 15,354 &#160; $ 34.36 &#160; Granted 14,238 &#160; 34.42 &#160; Forfeited (a) ( 3,113 ) 35.58 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 26,479 &#160; 34.25 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily related to the forfeiture of 2019 domestic performance units as performance during the period was below the minimum established performance threshold, which resulted in no payout. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, $ 2 million of TSR performance units vested. All awards vested were associated with the sale of the U.K. utility business. See Note 9 for additional information on the sale of the U.K. utility business. No TSR performance units vested for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020. Amounts for PPL Electric are insignificant. \n\nPerformance Units - Return on Equity \n\nIn 2017, PPL changed its executive compensation mix to add performance units based on achievement of a corporate Return on Equity (ROE). ROE performance units were intended to further align compensation with the company&#8217;s strategy and reward for future corporate performance. The Compensation Committee, eliminated the use of ROE performance units due to changes in its long-term incentive mix beginning in January 2022 . \n\nPayout of these performance units will be based on the calculated average of the annual corporate ROE for each year of the three -year performance period for PPL Corporation. In light of the transformational nature of the sale of the U.K. utility business in 2021, PPL&#8217;s ROE-based performance units issued for 2021 were based on a one-year performance period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021; however, these units retained the three year vesting schedule and other characteristics. ROE performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable ROE performance goal. ROE performance units can be paid up to 200 % of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, these performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, disability or death of an employee. \n\nThe fair value of each ROE performance unit is based on the closing price of PPL Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of ROE performance units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. As these awards are based on performance conditions, the level of attainment is monitored each reporting period and compensation expense is adjusted based on the expected attainment level. \n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of ROE performance units granted was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL $ 30.81 &#160; $ 30.08 &#160; $ 34.95 &#160; PPL Electric 30.70 &#160; 29.39 &#160; 35.59 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nROE performance unit activity for 2022 was: \n\n##TABLE_START ROE Performance Unit Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share PPL &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period 722,353 &#160; $ 31.28 &#160; Granted (a) 257,199 &#160; 30.81 &#160; Vested ( 470,182 ) 30.76 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 509,370 &#160; 31.53 &#160; PPL Electric &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period 15,354 &#160; $ 30.27 &#160; Granted (a) 3,663 &#160; 30.70 &#160; Vested ( 6,311 ) 30.78 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 12,706 &#160; 30.14 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents attainment updates to the 2019 awards that paid out at 200% of target, as well as dividend equivalents that accumulated on outstanding 2020 and 2021 awards. \n\nThe total fair value of ROE performance units vesting for the years ended December 31 was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL $ 12 &#160; $ 16 &#160; $ 8 &#160; PPL Electric &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPerformance Units - Earnings Growth \n\nBeginning in 2022, PPL changed its executive compensation mix to add performance units based on achievement of corporate earnings growth (EG) metrics. EG performance units are intended to further align executive compensation with the company&#8217;s future strategy. \n\nPayout of these performance units will be based on the earnings growth above the projected midpoint of ongoing earnings for the three -year performance period for PPL Corporation. EG performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable EG performance goal. EG performance units can be paid up to 200 % of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, these performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, disability or death of an employee. \n\nThe fair value of each EG performance unit is based on the closing price of PPL Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of EG performance units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. As these awards are based on performance conditions, the level of attainment is monitored each reporting period and compensation expense is adjusted based on the expected attainment level. \n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of EG performance units granted was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 PPL $ 29.29 &#160; PPL Electric 29.35 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEG performance unit activity for 2022 was: \n\n##TABLE_START EG Performance Unit Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share PPL &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Granted 141,880 &#160; 29.29 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 141,880 &#160; 29.29 &#160; PPL Electric &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Granted 6,888 &#160; 29.35 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 6,888 &#160; 29.35 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nPerformance Units - Environmental, Social and Governance \n\nBeginning in 2022, PPL changed its executive compensation mix to add performance units based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics. ESG performance units are tied to climate-related performance and intended to further align executive compensation with the company&#8217;s future strategy. \n\nPayout of these performance units will be based on the attainment of reductions in company vehicle emissions and building energy use, as well as the retirement of Mill Creek Unit 1, a coal-fired generating facility in Kentucky. ESG performance units can be paid up to 200 % of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, these performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, disability or death of an employee. \n\nThe fair value of each ESG performance unit is based on the closing price of PPL Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of ESG performance units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. As these awards are based on performance conditions, the level of attainment is monitored each reporting period and compensation expense is adjusted based on the expected attainment level. \n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of ESG performance units granted was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 PPL $ 29.29 &#160; PPL Electric 29.35 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nESG performance unit activity for 2022 was: \n\n##TABLE_START ESG Performance Unit Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share PPL &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Granted 141,880 &#160; 29.29 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 141,880 &#160; 29.29 &#160; PPL Electric &#160; &#160; Nonvested, beginning of period &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Granted 6,888 &#160; 29.35 &#160; Nonvested, end of period 6,888 &#160; 29.35 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nStock Options \n\nPPL's Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee, now known as the Compensation Committee, eliminated the use of stock options due to changes in its long-term incentive mix beginning in January 2014 . \n\nUnder the Plans, stock options had been granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair value of PPL's common stock on the date of grant. Options outstanding at December 31, 2022, are fully vested. All options expire no later than 10 years from the grant date. The options become exercisable immediately in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. \n\nStock option activity for 2022 was: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Total Intrinsic Value PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Outstanding at beginning of period 766,002 &#160; $ 26.57 &#160; &#160; &#160; Exercised ( 594,450 ) 26.44 &#160; &#160; &#160; Outstanding and exercisable at end of period 171,552 &#160; 27.04 &#160; 0.1 $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor 2022, 2021 and 2020, PPL received $ 18 million, $ 10 million and $ 8 million in cash from stock options exercised.

Retirement and Postemployment Benefits \n\n&#160; \n\n(All Registrants) \n\n&#160; \n\nDefined Benefits \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible for pension benefits under non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of service and final average pay, as defined by the plans. Effective January 1, 2012, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Newly hired employees are eligible to participate in the PPL Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) savings plan with enhanced employer contributions. \n\nThe defined benefit pension plans of LKE and its subsidiaries were closed to new salaried and bargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2005. Employees hired after December 31, 2005 receive additional company contributions above the standard matching contributions to their savings plans. The pension plans sponsored by LKE and LG&#38;E were merged effective January 1, 2020 into the LG&#38;E and KU Pension Plan. The merged plan is sponsored by LKE. LG&#38;E and KU participate in this plan. \n\nThe Rhode Island defined benefit plans provide most union employees, as well as non-union employees hired before January 1, 2011, with a retirement benefit. Supplemental non-qualified, non-contributory executive retirement programs provide additional defined pension benefits for certain executives. \n\nPPL and certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to executives and other key management employees through unfunded nonqualified retirement plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nCertain employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through contributory plans. Effective January 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Postretirement health benefits may be paid from 401(h) accounts established as part of the PPL Retirement Plan and the LG&#38;E and KU Pension Plan within the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust, funded VEBA trusts and company funds. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Rhode Island postretirement benefit plans provide health care and life insurance coverage to eligible retired employees. Eligibility is based on age and length of service requirements and, in most cases, retirees must contribute to the cost of their coverage. \n\n(PPL) \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table provides the components of net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) for PPL's pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Net periodic defined benefit costs (credits): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Service cost $ 51 &#160; $ 56 &#160; $ 56 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; Interest cost 144 &#160; 121 &#160; 146 &#160; 20 &#160; 16 &#160; 19 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 276 ) ( 255 ) ( 246 ) ( 28 ) ( 23 ) ( 21 ) Amortization of: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Prior service cost (credit) 8 &#160; 8 &#160; 9 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Actuarial (gain) loss 51 &#160; 93 &#160; 89 &#160; ( 5 ) ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; Net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) prior to settlements and termination benefits ( 22 ) 23 &#160; 54 &#160; ( 5 ) ( 1 ) 5 &#160; Settlements (a) 23 &#160; 18 &#160; 23 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) $ 1 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ 77 &#160; $ ( 5 ) $ ( 1 ) $ 5 &#160; Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in OCI and Regulatory Assets/Liabilities - Gross: Net (loss)/gain allocated at acquisition $ 33 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 49 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Settlement ( 23 ) ( 18 ) ( 23 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net (gain) loss 242 &#160; 42 &#160; ( 221 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 53 ) ( 6 ) Prior service cost (credit) &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Amortization of: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Prior service (cost) credit ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Actuarial gain (loss) ( 51 ) ( 93 ) ( 89 ) 5 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total recognized in OCI and regulatory assets/liabilities 193 &#160; ( 74 ) ( 341 ) ( 45 ) ( 53 ) ( 2 ) Total recognized in net periodic defined benefit costs, OCI and regulatory assets/liabilities $ 194 &#160; $ ( 33 ) $ ( 264 ) $ ( 50 ) $ ( 54 ) $ 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n(a) Settlement charges incurred as a result of the amount of lump sum payment distributions, primarily from the LKE qualified pension plan.

The investment strategy for the Master Trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assets that, in combination with PPL's funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and \n\nliquidity for benefit payments, while also managing the duration of the assets to complement the duration of the liabilities. The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian. The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL's Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities. This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios. The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions. The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. \n\n&#160; \n\nTarget allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility. In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time. EBPB investment guidelines as of the end of 2022 are presented below. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe asset allocation for the trust and the target allocation by portfolio at December 31 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Percentage of trust assets 2022 2022 2021 Target Asset Allocation Growth Portfolio 55 &#160; % 55 &#160; % 55 &#160; % Equity securities 31 &#160; % 32 &#160; % &#160; Debt securities (a) 13 &#160; % 13 &#160; % &#160; Alternative investments 11 &#160; % 10 &#160; % &#160; Immunizing Portfolio 43 &#160; % 43 &#160; % 43 &#160; % Debt securities (a) 33 &#160; % 35 &#160; % &#160; Derivatives (b) 10 &#160; % 8 &#160; % &#160; Liquidity Portfolio 2 &#160; % 2 &#160; % 2 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n(a) Includes commingled debt funds, which PPL treats as debt securities for asset allocation purposes. \n\n(b) Includes posted collateral to support derivative instruments subject to counterparty risk. \n\n&#160; \n\n(PPL) \n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair value of net assets in the Master Trust by asset class and level within the fair value hierarchy was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 PPL Services Corporation Master Trust &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents $ 306 &#160; $ 306 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 266 &#160; $ 266 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equity securities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Equity 34 &#160; 34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 41 &#160; 41 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. Equity fund measured at NAV (a) 574 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 754 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; International equity fund at NAV (a) 403 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 511 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Commingled debt measured at NAV (a) 526 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 677 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Debt securities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agency 153 &#160; 153 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 281 &#160; 280 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate 834 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 818 &#160; 16 &#160; 1,039 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,019 &#160; 20 &#160; Other 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Alternative investments: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Real estate measured at NAV (a) 60 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 69 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Private equity measured at NAV (a) 96 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 92 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Private credit partnerships measured at NAV (a) 6 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Hedge funds measured at NAV (a) 194 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 236 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Derivatives 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; &#8212; &#160; PPL Services Corporation Master Trust assets, at fair value 3,208 &#160; $ 493 &#160; $ 840 &#160; $ 16 &#160; 4,017 &#160; $ 587 &#160; $ 1,069 &#160; $ 20 &#160; Receivables and payables, net (b) 67 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 401(h) accounts restricted for other postretirement benefit obligations ( 126 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; ( 155 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; Total PPL Services Corporation Master Trust pension assets $ 3,149 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 3,887 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n(a) In accordance with accounting guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (NAV), or its equivalent, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position. \n\n(b) Receivables and payables, net represents amounts for investments sold/purchased but not yet settled along with interest and dividends earned but not yet received. \n\nA reconciliation of the Master Trust assets classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2022 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Corporate debt Balance at beginning of period $ 20 &#160; Actual return on plan assets: &#160; Relating to assets still held at the reporting date ( 2 ) Relating to assets sold during the period 2 &#160; Purchases, sales and settlements ( 4 ) Balance at end of period $ 16 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nA reconciliation of the Master Trust assets classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2021 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Corporate debt Balance at beginning of period $ 15 &#160; Purchases, sales and settlements 5 &#160; Balance at end of period $ 20 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair value measurements of cash and cash equivalents are based on the amounts on deposit. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe market approach is used to measure fair value of equity securities. The fair value measurements of equity securities (excluding commingled funds), which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets. These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities. Investments in commingled equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities. Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations, as well as funds that invest in investment grade long-duration fixed-income securities. \n\nThe fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models, which incorporate observable inputs. Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data. For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in core U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). The strategy is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants. This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor. Core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies. The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others. The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies. The partnerships have limited lives of at least 10 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received. Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. \n\nInvestments in private credit represent pools of actively managed loans that span capital structure and borrower type. Strategies carry different types and levels of risk. Returns from those strategies will vary in terms of yield, fees generated, loan loss rates and the pace of principal repayment. Investments have limited lives of approximately 2-8 years. The investment cannot be redeemed with the general partner; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner&#8217;s approval. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners&#8217; capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. \n\n&#160; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Master Trust had unfunded commitments of $ 116 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships. \n\nInvestments in hedge funds represent investments in a fund of hedge funds. Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions. Major investment strategies for the fund of hedge funds include long/short equity, tactical trading, event driven, and relative value. Shares may be redeemed with 45 days prior written notice. The fund is subject to short term lockups and other restrictions. The fair value for the fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. These securities primarily represent investments in treasury futures, total return swaps, interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap), which are valued based on quoted prices, changes in the value of the underlying exposure or on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings. \n\n&#160; \n\nPlan Assets - Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \n\nThe investment strategy with respect to other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401(h) accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner. Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments. These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers and, therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds. Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. Ownership interests in money market funds are treated as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. The asset allocation for the PPL VEBA trusts and the target allocation, by asset class, at December 31 are detailed below. \n\n##TABLE_START Percentage of plan assets Target Asset Allocation &#160; 2022 2021 2022 Asset Class &#160; &#160; &#160; Equity securities 45 &#160; % 45 &#160; % 44 &#160; % Debt securities (a) 48 &#160; % 52 &#160; % 50 &#160; % Cash and cash equivalents (b) 7 &#160; % 3 &#160; % 6 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes commingled debt funds and debt securities. \n\n(b) Includes money market funds. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe fair value of assets in the other postretirement benefit plans by asset class and level within the fair value hierarchy was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; Fair Value Measurement Using Fair Value Measurement Using &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Money market funds $ 19 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equity securities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Large-cap equity fund measure at NAV (a) 71 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 96 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Commingled debt fund measured at NAV (a) 77 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 75 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Global equity exchange-traded fund 61 &#160; 61 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Long-term bond exchange-traded fund 65 &#160; 65 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Debt securities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Corporate bonds &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 38 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 38 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total VEBA trust assets, at fair value 293 &#160; $ 145 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 215 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 38 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Receivables and payables, net (b) ( 2 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; ( 3 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; 401(h) account assets 126 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 155 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total other postretirement benefit plan assets $ 417 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 367 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n(a) In accordance with accounting guidance certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (NAV), or its equivalent, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The primary objective of the fund is a level of current income consistent with stability of principal and liquidity. Redemptions can be made daily on this fund. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in large-cap equity securities represent investments in a passively managed equity index fund that invests in securities and a combination of other collective funds. Fair value measurements are not obtained from a quoted price in an active market but are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share as provided by the trustee of the fund. Redemptions can be made daily on this fund. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments in commingled debt securities represent investments in a fund that invests in a diversified portfolio of investment grade long-duration fixed income securities. Redemptions can be made daily on these funds. \n\nInvestments in global equity exchange-traded fund represents a passively-managed pooled investment vehicle that invests in developed market equities and is designed to track the performance of the MSCI World Index. Fair value measurements can be obtained from a quoted price on the exchange. Redemptions can be made daily on this fund. \n\nInvestments in long-term bond exchange-traded fund represents a passively-managed pooled investment vehicle that is designed to track the performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Long Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index, which includes all medium and larger issues of U.S. Government, investment-grade corporate and investment-grade international dollar-denominated bonds that have maturities of greater than 10 years. Fair value measurements can be obtained from a quoted price on the exchange. Redemptions can be made daily on this fund. \n\nInvestments in corporate bonds represent investment in a diversified portfolio of investment grade long-duration fixed income securities. The fair value of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. \n\nExpected Cash Flows - Defined Benefit Plans (PPL) \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL does not plan to contribute to its pension plans in 2023, as PPL's defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements. \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets are segregated from corporate assets. PPL expects to make approximately $ 10 million of benefit payments under these plans in 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nPPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized. Continuation of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $ 27 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans and the following federal subsidy payments are expected to be received by PPL. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Other Postretirement Pension Benefit Payment Expected Federal Subsidy 2023 $ 282 &#160; $ 51 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 2024 281 &#160; 50 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2025 283 &#160; 49 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2026 280 &#160; 48 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2027 275 &#160; 48 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2028-2032 1,327 &#160; 225 &#160; 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nSavings Plans (All Registrants) \n\n&#160; \n\nSubstantially, all employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible to participate in deferred savings plans (401(k)s).

See footnote (e) to the table in \"Guarantees and Other Assurances\" below for information on the OVEC power purchase contract. Future obligations for power purchases from OVEC are demand payments, comprised of debt-service payments and contractually-required reimbursements of plant operating, maintenance and other expenses, and are projected as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; LG&#38;E KU Total 2023 $ 24 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 34 &#160; 2024 22 &#160; 10 &#160; 32 &#160; 2025 22 &#160; 10 &#160; 32 &#160; 2026 22 &#160; 10 &#160; 32 &#160; 2027 22 &#160; 10 &#160; 32 &#160; Thereafter 184 &#160; 81 &#160; 265 &#160; Total $ 296 &#160; $ 131 &#160; $ 427 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nLG&#38;E and KU had total energy purchases under the OVEC PPA for the years ended December 31 as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 LG&#38;E $ 21 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 12 &#160; KU 9 &#160; 6 &#160; 6 &#160; Total $ 30 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 18 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(PPL) \n\nRIE has several long-term contracts for the purchase of electric power. Substantially all of these contracts require power to be delivered before RIE is obligated to make payment. Additionally, RIE has entered various contracts for gas delivery, storage, and supply services. Certain of these contracts require payment of annual demand charges, which are recoverable from customers. RIE is liable for these payments regardless of the level of service required from third-parties. \n\nThese contracts include the following commitments: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nContract Type \n\nMaximum Maturity \n\nDate \n\nElectric power \n\nGas-related \n\nBeyond 2027 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRIE&#8217;s commitments under these long-term contracts subsequent to December 31, 2022 are summarized in the table below. ##TABLE_START Total \n\n2023 2024-2025 \n\n2026-2027 \n\nThereafter \n\nEnergy Purchase Obligations \n\n$ 995 &#160; $ 471 &#160; $ 172 &#160; $ 73 &#160; $ 279 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nLong-term Contracts for Renewable Energy (PPL) \n\nSeveral of the obligations included in the table above relate to certain long-term contracts for renewable energy, including: \n\n&#8226; the Deepwater Wind PPA, involving a proposal for a small-scale renewable energy generation project of up to eight offshore wind turbines with an aggregate nameplate capacity of up to 30 MW to benefit the Town of New Shoreham and an underwater cable to Block Island, which entered into service in October 2016; \n\n&#8226; the Three-State Procurement, involving eight long-term contracts pursuant to the Rhode Island Long-Term Contracting Standard (LTCS) of which 36.75 MW is currently operational and with respect to which RIE collects 2.75% remunerations in the annual payments pursuant to the LTCS; and \n\n&#8226; the Offshore Wind Energy Procurement, pursuant to a 20-year PPA with Deep Water Wind Rev I, LLC (Revolution Wind), with an expected capacity of 408 MW expected to be operational in 2024; this contract was approved without remuneration but allows RIE to seek costs incurred under the agreement. \n\nIn addition, RIE is obligated under the LTCS (as amended in 2014) to annually solicit for renewable projects until 90 MW of renewable contracting capacity has been secured. The RIPUC-approved solicitations currently in service include: (i) a 15-year PPA with Orbit Energy Rhode Island, LLC for a 3.2 MW nameplate anaerobic digester biogas project located in Johnston, Rhode Island, placed in service in 2017, (ii) a 15-year PPA with Black Bear Development Holdings, LLC for a 3.9 MW nameplate run-of-river hydroelectric plant located in Orono, Maine, placed in service in 2013, and (iii) a 15-year PPA with Copenhagen Wind Farm, LLC for an 80 MW nameplate land-based wind project located in Denmark, New York, placed in service in 2018. RIE will be required to backfill approximately 12 MW of renewable contracting capacity to fulfill the required 90 MW under LTCS. \n\nIn addition to the LTCS, in July 2022, Rhode Island passed an amendment to the Affordable Clean Energy Security Act (ACES) that requires RIE to issue a request for proposals (RFP) for at least 600 MW but no greater than 1,000 MW of newly developed offshore wind capacity no later than October 15, 2022. The RFP was issued on October 14, 2022 following a public comment period. Based upon the RFP issued on October 14, 2022, and subsequently revised on November 7, 2022, RIE anticipates conditional project selection in June 2023. RIE must negotiate in good faith to achieve a commercially reasonable contract and must file such contract with the RIPUC for approval no later than March 15, 2024, unless RIE can show that the bids are unlikely to lead to a contract that meets all of the statutory requirements. \n\nAs approved by the RIPUC, RIE is allowed to pass through commodity-related/purchased power costs to customers and collect remuneration equal to 2.75% for long-term contracts approved pursuant to LTCS that have achieved commercial operation. For long-term contracts approved pursuant to ACES, as amended, on or after January 1, 2022, RIE is entitled to financial remuneration equal to 1.0% through December 31, 2026 for those projects that are commercially operating. For long-term contracts approved pursuant to ACES on or after January 1, 2027, RIE is not entitled to any financial remuneration, unless otherwise granted by the RIPUC. Also, the amendments to ACES added a provision, which provides that for any calendar year in which RIE&#8217;s actual return on equity exceeds the return on equity allowed by the RIPUC in the last general rate case, the RIPUC may adjust any or all remuneration to assure that such remuneration does not result in or contribute toward RIE earning above its allowed return for such calendar year. \n\nLegal Matters \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities, unless otherwise noted. \n\nTalen Litigation \n\nBackground (PPL) \n\nIn September 2013, one of PPL's former subsidiaries, PPL Montana entered into an agreement to sell its hydroelectric generating facilities. In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply, the parent company of PPL Montana, entered into various definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and ultimately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a stand-alone company named Talen Energy. In November 2014, after executing the spinoff agreements but prior to the closing of the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana closed the sale of its hydroelectric generating facilities. Subsequently, on June 1, 2015, the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply was completed. Following the spinoff transaction, PPL had no continuing ownership interest in or control of PPL Energy Supply. In connection with the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana became Talen Montana, LLC (Talen Montana), a subsidiary of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Marketing also became a subsidiary of Talen Energy. Talen Energy has owned and operated both Talen Montana and Talen Energy Marketing since the spinoff. At the time of the spinoff, affiliates of Riverstone acquired a 35 % ownership interest in Talen Energy. Riverstone subsequently acquired the remaining interests in Talen Energy in a take private transaction in December 2016. \n\nOn October 29, 2018, Talen Montana Retirement Plan and Talen Energy Marketing filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of current and contingent creditors of Talen Montana who allegedly suffered harm or allegedly will suffer reasonably foreseeable harm as a result of the November 2014 distribution of proceeds from the sale of then-PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities. The action was filed in the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana, Rosebud County, against PPL and certain of its affiliates and current and former officers and directors (Talen Putative Class Action). Plaintiffs asserted claims for, among other things, fraudulent transfer, both actual and constructive; recovery against subsequent transferees; civil conspiracy; aiding and abetting tortious conduct; and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs sought avoidance of the purportedly fraudulent transfer, unspecified damages, including punitive damages, the imposition of a constructive trust, and other relief. In January 2020, PPL defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of the below mentioned Delaware Action and on September 11, 2020, the Court granted PPL defendants' alternative Motion for a Stay. \n\nOn November 30, 2018, PPL, certain PPL affiliates, and certain current and former officers and directors (PPL plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking various forms of relief against Riverstone, Talen Energy and certain of their affiliates (Delaware Action), in response to and as part of the defense strategy for an action filed by Talen Montana, LLC (the Talen Direct Action, since dismissed) and the Talen Putative Class Action described above originally filed in Montana state court in October 2018. In the complaint, the PPL plaintiffs asked the Delaware Court of Chancery for declaratory and injunctive relief, including a declaratory judgment that under the separation agreement governing the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, all related claims that arise must be heard in Delaware; that the statute of limitations in Delaware and the spinoff agreement bar these claims at this time; that PPL is not liable for the claims in either the Talen Direct Action or the Talen Putative Class Action because PPL Montana was solvent at all relevant times; and that the separation agreement requires that Talen Energy indemnify PPL for all losses arising from the debts of Talen Montana, among other things. PPL's complaint also sought damages against Riverstone for interfering with the separation agreement and against Riverstone affiliates for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In October 2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued an opinion sustaining all of the PPL plaintiffs' claims except for the claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \n\nTalen Energy Supply, LLC et al. and Talen Montana LLC v. PPL Corp., PPL Capital Funding, Inc., PPL Electric Utilities Corp., and PPL Energy Funding (PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nOn May 9, 2022, Talen Energy Supply, LLC and 71 affiliates, including Talen Montana, LLC, filed petitions for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Texas Bankruptcy Court). \n\nOn May 10, 2022, Talen Montana, LLC, as debtor-in-possession, filed a complaint initiating an adversary proceeding (Adversary Proceeding) in the Texas Bankruptcy Court against PPL Corporation, PPL Capital Funding, Inc., PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, and PPL Energy Funding Corporation. Similar to the litigation in Montana, the Adversary Proceeding seeks the recovery of an allegedly fraudulent transfer relating to PPL Montana&#8217;s November 2014 sale of hydroelectric assets to Northwestern and subsequent distribution of certain proceeds of that sale of approximately $ 900 million, reiterating claims that the parties had already been litigating. \n\nBoth the Talen Putative Class Action and Delaware Action have now been transferred to and consolidated in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. PPL has filed its Answer and asserted a Counterclaim against the Talen and Riverstone entities, similar to the claims previously asserted in the Delaware Action, and has filed a motion for partial summary judgment that was heard on October 31, 2022. Upon agreement by the parties, mediation will commence on February 22, 2023 before Judge David R. Jones of the Texas Bankruptcy Court. \n\nPPL believes that the 2014 distribution of proceeds was made in compliance with all applicable laws and that PPL Montana was solvent at all relevant times. Additionally, the agreements entered into in connection with the spinoff, which PPL and affiliates of Talen Energy and Riverstone negotiated and executed prior to the 2014 distribution, directly address the treatment of the proceeds from the sale of PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities; in those agreements, Talen Energy and Riverstone definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain the proceeds. \n\nPPL believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims made in the Adversary Proceeding and intends to vigorously defend against this action. At this time, PPL cannot predict the outcome of the Adversary Proceeding or estimate the range of possible losses, if any, that PPL might incur as a result of the claims, although they could be material. \n\nNarragansett Electric Litigation (PPL) \n\nAquidneck Island \n\nIn January 2019, Narragansett Electric suffered a significant loss of gas supply to the distribution system that serves customers on Aquidneck Island in Rhode Island, affecting approximately 7,500 customers. Following Narraganset Electric&#8217;s efforts to address customer concerns and expenses following the incident, and an investigation by the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, Narragansett Electric published a long-term capacity study for energy solutions for Aquidneck Island and gathered extensive stakeholder feedback. Narraganset Electric continues to discuss this matter with the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. Narragansett Electric filed a supplemental application for its preferred long-term solution on April 1, 2022. \n\nNarragansett Electric is facing various lawsuits related to the Aquidneck Island gas supply interruption, including two purported class actions. Narragansett Electric is actively defending against these claims. This matter is covered by excess liability insurance, which is currently reimbursing RIE for ongoing costs and claim amounts, subject to reservation of rights, and is not expected to materially affect RIE&#8217;s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Programs Investigation \n\nNarragansett Electric, while under the ownership of National Grid, performed an internal investigation into conduct associated with its energy efficiency programs. Any adjustments that may be a result of the internal investigation remain subject to review and approval by the RIPUC. At this time, it is not possible to predict the final outcome or determine the total amount of any additional liabilities that may be incurred in connection with it by Narragansett Electric. This review by the RIPUC may be impacted by other investigations that are ongoing related to National Grid. Narragansett Electric does not expect this matter will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n\nOn June 27, 2022, the RIPUC opened a new docket (RIPUC Docket 22-05-EE) to investigate RIE&#8217;s actions and the actions of its National Grid employees during the time RIE was a National Grid U.S. affiliate being provided services by National Grid USA Service Company, Inc. relating to the manipulation of the reporting of invoices affecting the calculation of past energy efficiency shareholder incentives and the resulting impact on customers. The Rhode Island Attorney General and National Grid USA intervened in the docket. On January 19, 2023, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (the Division) filed a motion to dismiss the docket without prejudice. As grounds for its motion, the Division stated that sufficient evidence exists in the docket to warrant an independent summary investigation by the Division, to include an audit of RIE, pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws Section 39-4-13. If the Division finds sufficient grounds, the Division may proceed to a formal hearing regarding the matters under investigation pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws Sections 39-4-14 and 39-4-15. Upon the conclusion of its investigation, the Division will provide the RIPUC with a report outlining the Division&#8217;s findings and final decision. On January 30, 2023, the Rhode Island Attorney General filed an objection to the Division&#8217;s motion to dismiss; RIE and National Grid each filed responses with the RIPUC requesting that any additional action taken by the RIPUC or the Division be considered after National Grid completes its internal investigation report to be filed with the RIPUC by March 1, 2023. \n\nE.W. Brown Environmental Assessment ( PPL and KU) \n\nKU is undertaking extensive remedial measures at the E.W. Brown plant including closure of the former ash pond, implementation of a groundwater remedial action plan and performance of a corrective action plan including aquatic study of adjacent surface waters and risk assessment. The aquatic study and risk assessment are being undertaken pursuant to a 2017 agreed Order with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). KU conducted sampling of Herrington Lake in 2017 and 2018. In June 2019, KU submitted to the KEEC the required aquatic study and risk assessment, conducted by an independent third-party consultant, finding that discharges from the E.W. Brown plant have not had any significant impact on Herrington Lake and that the water in the lake is safe for recreational use and meets safe drinking water standards. On May 31, 2021, the KEEC approved the report and released a response to public comments. On August 6, 2021, KU submitted a Supplemental Remedial Alternatives Analysis report to the KEEC that outlines proposed additional fish, water, and sediment testing. On February 18, 2022, the KEEC provided approval to KU to proceed with the proposed sampling, which commenced in the spring of 2022. On November 17, 2022, KU submitted a Supplemental Performance Monitoring Report to the KEEC finding that there are no significant unaddressed risks to human health or the environment at the plant. \n\nAir (PPL and LG&#38;E) \n\nSulfuric Acid Mist Emissions \n\nIn June 2016, the EPA issued a notice of violation under the Clean Air Act alleging that LG&#38;E violated applicable rules relating to sulfuric acid mist emissions at its Mill Creek plant. The notice alleges failure to install proper controls, failure to operate the facility consistent with good air pollution control practice and causing emissions exceeding applicable requirements or constituting a nuisance or endangerment. LG&#38;E believes it has complied with applicable regulations during the relevant time period. On July 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging violations specified in the EPA notice of violation and seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. In October 2020, LG&#38;E filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District filed an amended complaint. In February 2021, LG&#38;E filed a renewed motion to dismiss regarding the amended complaint. On February 23, 2022, the court entered a consent decree negotiated by the parties to resolve the violations alleged in the complaint. As required by the consent decree, LG&#38;E paid a civil penalty on March 4, 2022 and subsequently commenced implementation of a supplemental environmental project (SEP). The agreed penalty and SEP do not have a significant impact on LG&#38;E's operations or financial condition. \n\nWater/Waste (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nELGs \n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized ELGs for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities. These guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment and mandate operational changes including \"no discharge\" requirements for certain wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations was to be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA. Legal challenges to the final rule were consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In April 2017, the EPA announced that it would grant petitions for reconsideration of the rule. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rule to postpone the compliance date for certain requirements. In October 2020, the EPA published final revisions to its best available technology standards for certain wastewaters and potential extensions to compliance dates (the Reconsideration Rule). The rule is expected to be implemented by the states or applicable permitting authorities in the course of their normal permitting activities. LG&#38;E and KU are currently implementing responsive compliance strategies and schedules. Certain aspects of these compliance plans and estimates relate to developments in state water quality standards, which are separate from the ELG rule or its implementation. Certain costs are included in the Registrants' capital plans and expected to be recovered from customers through rate recovery mechanisms, but additional costs and recovery will depend on further regulatory developments at the state level. In August 2021, the EPA published a notice of rulemaking announcing that it will propose revisions to the Reconsideration Rule and determine \"whether more stringent limitations and standards are appropriate.\" Compliance with the Reconsideration Rule is required during the pendency of the rulemaking process. \n\nCCRs \n\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule governing management of CCRs which include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. The CCR Rule imposes extensive new requirements for certain CCR impoundments and landfills, including public notifications, location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action \n\nrequirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements, and specifies restrictions relating to the beneficial use of CCRs. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule extending the deadline for closure of certain impoundments and adopting other substantive changes. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule. In December 2019, the EPA addressed the deficiencies identified by the court and proposed amendments to change the closure deadline. In August 2020, the EPA published a final rule extending the deadline to initiate closure to April 11, 2021, while providing for certain extensions. The EPA is conducting ongoing rulemaking actions regarding various other amendments to the rule. Certain ongoing legal challenges to various provisions of the CCR Rule have been held in abeyance pending review by the EPA pursuant to the President's executive order. PPL, LG&#38;E, and KU are monitoring the EPA&#8217;s ongoing efforts to refine and implement the regulatory program under the CCR Rule. In January 2022, the EPA issued several proposed regulatory determinations, facility notifications, and public announcements which indicate increased scrutiny by the EPA to determine the adequacy of measures taken by facility owners and operators to achieve closure of CCR surface impoundments and landfills. In particular, the agency indicated that it will focus on certain practices which it views as posing a threat of continuing groundwater contamination. Future guidance, regulatory determinations, rulemakings, and other developments could potentially require revisions to current LG&#38;E and KU compliance plans including additional monitoring and remediation at surface impoundments and landfills, the cost of which could be substantial. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, rulemaking, and regulatory determinations or potential impacts on current LG&#38;E and KU compliance plans. The Registrants are currently finalizing closure plans and schedules. \n\nIn January 2017, Kentucky issued a new state rule relating to CCR management, effective May 2017, aimed at reflecting the requirements of the federal CCR rule. As a result of a subsequent legal challenge, in January 2018, the Franklin County, Kentucky Circuit Court issued an opinion invalidating certain procedural elements of the rule. LG&#38;E and KU presently operate their facilities under continuing permits authorized under the former program and do not currently anticipate material impacts as a result of the judicial ruling. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. \n\nLG&#38;E and KU received KPSC approval for a compliance plan providing for the closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek, Trimble County, E.W. Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with the federal CCR rule, KU also received KPSC approval for its plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law. LG&#38;E and KU have completed planned closure measures at most of the subject impoundments and have commenced post closure groundwater monitoring as required at those facilities. LG&#38;E and KU generally expect to complete all impoundment closures within five years of commencement, although a longer period may be required to complete closure of some facilities. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. \n\nIn connection with the final CCR rule, LG&#38;E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015 and continue to record adjustments as required. See Note 20 for additional information. Further changes to AROs, current capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are expected to be subject to rate recovery. \n\nSuperfund and Other Remediation \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants are potentially responsible for investigating and remediating contamination under the federal Superfund program and similar state programs. Actions are under way at certain sites including former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Kentucky previously owned or operated by, or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of, PPL subsidiaries. \n\nDepending on the outcome of investigations at identified sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, additional costs of remediation could be incurred. PPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU lack sufficient information about such additional sites to estimate any potential liability or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. Such costs, however, are not currently expected to be significant. \n\nThe EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. As a result, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup, that could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants. The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these matters. \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric is potentially responsible for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including the Columbia Gas Plant site and the Brodhead site. Cleanup actions have been or are being undertaken at these sites as requested by governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL Electric. \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of $ 11 million and $ 10 million representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate the sites identified above. \n\n(PPL) \n\nRIE is potentially responsible for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including former manufactured gas plant (MGP) facilities formerly owned by the Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company and the Rhode Island gas distribution assets of the New England Gas division of Southern Union Company and electric operations at certain RIE facilities. RIE is currently investigating and remediating, as necessary, those MGP sites and certain other properties under agreements with governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL. \n\nOn December 31, 2022, RIE had a recorded liability of $ 100 million representing its best estimate of the remaining costs of environmental remediation activities. These undiscounted costs are expected to be incurred over approximately 30 years and to be subject to rate recovery. However, remediation costs for each site may be materially higher than estimated, depending on changing technologies and regulatory standards, selected end uses for each site, and actual environmental conditions encountered. RIE has recovered amounts from certain insurers and potentially responsible parties, and, where appropriate, may seek additional recovery from other insurers and from other potentially responsible parties, but it is uncertain whether, and to what extent, such efforts will be successful. \n\nThe RIPUC has approved two settlement agreements that provide for rate recovery of qualified remediation costs of certain contaminated sites located in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Rate-recoverable contributions for electric operations of approximately $ 3 million are added annually to the Environmental Response Fund, along with interest and any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third-parties. In addition, RIE recovers approximately $ 1 million annually for gas operations under a distribution adjustment charge in which the qualified remediation costs are amortized over 10 years. See Note 7 for additional information on RIE's recorded environmental regulatory assets and liabilities. \n\nRegulatory Issues \n\nSee Note 7 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation. \n\nElectricity - Reliability Standards \n\nThe NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards. \n\nThe Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations. \n\nPPL Electric, LG&#38;E, KU and RIE monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential violations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any Regional Reliability Entity determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC. \n\nIn the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined. \n\nGas - Security Directives (PPL and LG&#38;E) \n\nIn May and July of 2021, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released two security directives applicable to certain notified owners and operators of natural gas pipeline facilities (including local distribution companies) that the TSA has determined to be critical. The TSA has determined that LG&#38;E is critical, while RIE has not been notified of this distinction. The first security directive required notified owners/operators to implement cybersecurity incident reporting to the DHS, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, and perform a gap assessment of current entity cybersecurity practices against certain voluntary TSA security guidelines and report relevant results and proposed mitigation to applicable DHS agencies. The second security directive required notified entities to implement a significant number of specified cyber security controls and processes. LG&#38;E does not believe the security directives have had or will have a significant impact on LG&#38;E&#8217;s operations or financial condition. \n\nOther \n\nGuarantees and Other Assurances \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Examples of such agreements include: guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage. \n\n(PPL) \n\nPPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt obligations of PPL Capital Funding. \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nThe table below details guarantees provided as of December 31, 2022. \"Exposure\" represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. The Registrants believe the probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote, except for the guarantees and indemnifications related to the sale of Safari Holdings, which PPL believes are reasonably possible but not probable of occurring. For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the guarantees of PPL include the guarantees of its subsidiary Registrants. \n\n##TABLE_START Exposure at December 31, 2022 Expiration Date PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; Indemnifications related to certain tax liabilities related to the sale of the U.K. utility business &#163; 50 &#160; (a) 2028 PPL guarantee of Safari payment obligations under certain sale/leaseback financing transactions related to the sale of Safari Holdings $ 148 &#160; (b) 2028 PPL guarantee of Safari payment obligations under certain PPAs related to the sale of Safari Holdings 55 &#160; (c) Indemnifications for losses suffered related to items not covered by Aspen Power's representation and warranty insurance associated with the sale of Safari Holdings 140 &#160; (d) Various LG&#38;E and KU &#160; &#160; &#160; LG&#38;E and KU obligation of shortfall related to OVEC &#160; (e) &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) PPL WPD Limited entered into a Tax Deed dated June 9, 2021 in which it agreed to a tax indemnity regarding certain potential tax liabilities of the entities sold with respect to periods prior to the completion of the sale, subject to customary exclusions and limitations. Because National Grid Holdings One plc, the buyer, agreed to purchase indemnity insurance, the amount of the cap on the indemnity for these liabilities is &#163;1, except with respect to certain surrenders of tax losses, for which the amount of the cap on the indemnity is &#163; 50 million. \n\n(b) PPL guaranteed the payment obligations of Safari under certain sale/leaseback financing transactions executed by Safari. These guarantees will remain in place until Safari exercises its option to buy-out the projects under the sale/leaseback financings by the year 2028. Safari will indemnify PPL for any payments made by PPL or claims against PPL under the sale/leaseback transaction guarantees up to $ 25 million. The estimated maximum exposure of this guarantee is $ 148 million. \n\n(c) PPL guaranteed the payment obligations of Safari under certain PPAs executed by Safari. Aspen Power is expected to replace these guarantees and retain liability for any payments made by PPL or claims against PPL under any guarantee that is not replaced. The estimated maximum exposure of this guarantee is $ 55 million. \n\n(d) Aspen Power has obtained representation and warranty insurance, therefore, PPL generally has no liability for its representations and warranties under the agreement except for losses suffered related to items not covered. Expiration of these indemnifications range from 18 months to 6 years from the date of the closing of the transaction, and PPL&#8217;s aggregate liability for these claims will not exceed $ 140 million subject to certain adjustments plus the support obligations provided by PPL under sale-leaseback financings and PPAs that will be replaced by Aspen Power. \n\n(e) Pursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, LG&#38;E and KU are obligated to pay for their share of OVEC's excess debt service, post-retirement and decommissioning costs, as well as any shortfall from amounts included within a demand charge designed and expected to cover these costs over the term of the contract. PPL's proportionate share of OVEC's outstanding debt was $ 89 million at December 31, 2022, consisting of LG&#38;E's share of $ 62 million and KU's share of $ 27 million. The maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable. See \"Energy Purchase Commitments\" above for additional information on the OVEC power purchase contract. \n\nThe Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote. \n\nPPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of $ 225 million. This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements. \n\n15. Related Party Transactions \n\nWholesale Sales and Purchases &#160; (LG&#38;E and KU) &#160; \n\nLG&#38;E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers. When LG&#38;E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&#38;E and vice versa. These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as \"Electric revenue from affiliate\" and \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" and are recorded at a price equal to the seller's fuel cost plus any split savings. Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies. The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its available generation. \n\nSupport Costs (PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nPPL Services and LKS provide and, prior to its merger into PPL Services on December 31, 2021, PPL EU Services provided the Registrants and each other with administrative, management and support services. For all services companies, the costs of directly assignable and attributable services are charged to the respective recipients as direct support costs. General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific entity are allocated and charged to the respective recipients as indirect support costs. PPL Services and PPL EU Services use a three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs. PPL Services may also use a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs or a weighted average cost ratio. LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical information. PPL Services, PPL EU Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the years ended December 31, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense on the books of the recipients, based on methods that are believed to be reasonable. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 PPL Electric from PPL Services $ 241 &#160; $ 54 &#160; $ 50 &#160; PPL Electric from PPL EU Services &#8212; &#160; 222 &#160; 176 &#160; LG&#38;E from LKS 153 &#160; 169 &#160; 170 &#160; LG&#38;E from PPL Services 13 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; KU from LKS 171 &#160; 179 &#160; 180 &#160; KU from PPL Services 14 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIn addition to the charges for services noted above, LKS makes payments on behalf of LG&#38;E and KU for fuel purchases and other costs for products or services provided by third parties. LG&#38;E and KU also provide services to each other and to LKS. Billings between LG&#38;E and KU relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work for the other company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. Tax settlements between PPL and LG&#38;E and KU are reimbursed through LKS. \n\nIntercompany Borrowings \n\n(PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Energy Funding maintains a $ 1,200 million revolving line of credit with a PPL Electric subsidiary. At December 31, 2022, PPL Energy Funding had no borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2021, $ 499 million was outstanding. This balance is reflected in \"Notes receivable from affiliate\" on the PPL Electric balance sheet. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. Interest income is reflected in \"Interest Income from Affiliate\" on the Income Statements. \n\nCEP Reserves maintains a $ 500 million revolving line of credit with a PPL Electric subsidiary. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, CEP Reserves had no borrowings outstanding. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. Interest income is reflected in \"Interest Income from Affiliate\" on the Income Statements. \n\n(LG&#38;E) \n\nLG&#38;E participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or KU make available to LG&#38;E funds up to the difference between LG&#38;E's FERC borrowing limit and LG&#38;E's commercial paper limit at an interest rate based on the lower of a market index of commercial paper issues and two additional rate options based on LIBOR. At December 31, 2022, LG&#38;E's money pool unused capacity was $ 250 million. At December 31, 2022, LG&#38;E had no borrowings outstanding from KU and/or LKE. At December 31, 2021, LG&#38;E had borrowings of $ 324 million outstanding from LKE. These balances are reflected in \"Notes payable to affiliates\" on the LG&#38;E Balance Sheets. \n\n(KU) \n\nKU participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or LG&#38;E make available to KU funds up to the difference between KU's FERC borrowing limit and KU's commercial paper limit at an interest rate based on the lower of a market index of commercial paper issues and two additional rate options based on LIBOR. At December 31, 2022, KU's money pool unused capacity was $ 250 million. At December 31, 2022, KU had no borrowings outstanding from LG&#38;E and/or LKE. At December 31, 2021, KU had borrowings of $ 294 million outstanding from LKE. These balances are reflected in \"Notes payable to affiliates\" on the KU Balance Sheets. \n\nVEBA Funds Receivable (PPL Electric) \n\nIn May 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA, to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. Based on PPL Electric's participation in PPL&#8217;s Other Postretirement Benefit plan, PPL Electric was allocated a portion of the excess funds from PPL Services. These funds have been recorded as an intercompany receivable on the Balance Sheets. The receivable balance decreases as PPL Electric pays incurred medical claims and is reimbursed by PPL Services. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was immaterial as of December 31, 2022. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was $ 11 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $ 10 million was reflected in \"Accounts receivable from affiliates\" and $ 1 million was reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. \n\nOther (PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nSee Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement (for PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU) and intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense (for PPL Electric). For PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU, see Note 12 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations associated with defined benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\n16. Other Income (Expense) - net \n\n(PPL) \n\nThe components of \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" for the years ended December 31, were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Defined benefit plans - non-service credits (Note 12) $ 47 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ ( 2 ) Interest income 4 &#160; 12 &#160; 9 &#160; AFUDC - equity component 22 &#160; 18 &#160; 20 &#160; Charitable contributions ( 14 ) ( 14 ) ( 3 ) Miscellaneous ( 5 ) ( 22 ) ( 22 ) Other Income (Expense) - net $ 54 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 2 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n(PPL Electric) \n\nThe components of \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" for the years ended December 31, were: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Defined benefit plans - non-service credits (Note 12) $ 15 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 4 &#160; Interest income 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; AFUDC - equity component 16 &#160; 18 &#160; 19 &#160; Charitable contributions ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Miscellaneous ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) Other Income (Expense) - net $ 30 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 18 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n17. Fair Value Measurements \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis. See Note 1 for information on the levels in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements \n\nThe assets and liabilities measured at fair value were: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 PPL &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents $ 356 &#160; $ 356 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,571 &#160; $ 3,571 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Restricted cash and cash equivalents (a) 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (b) 357 &#160; 357 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,572 &#160; 3,572 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Special use funds (a): Money market fund 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Commingled debt fund measured at NAV (c) 13 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 22 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Commingled equity fund measured at NAV (c) 11 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 21 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total special use funds 25 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 45 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Price risk management assets (d): Gas contracts 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total assets $ 407 &#160; $ 358 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,617 &#160; $ 3,574 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Liabilities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Price risk management liabilities (d): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest rate swaps $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Gas contracts 66 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; 56 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total price risk management liabilities $ 73 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 17 &#160; $ 56 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 PPL Electric &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents $ 25 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Total assets $ 25 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; LG&#38;E &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents $ 93 &#160; $ 93 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Total assets $ 93 &#160; $ 93 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Liabilities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Price risk management liabilities: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest rate swaps $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Total price risk management liabilities $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; KU &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and cash equivalents $ 21 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Total assets $ 21 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Current portion is included in \"Other current assets\" and long-term portion is included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. \n\n(b) Total Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash provides a reconciliation of these items reported within the Balance Sheets to the sum shown on the Statements of Cash Flows. \n\n(c) In accordance with accounting guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using net asset value per share (NAV), or its equivalent, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position. \n\n(d) Current portion is included in \"Other current liabilities\" and noncurrent portion is included in \"Other deferred credits and noncurrent liabilities\" on the Balance Sheets. \n\nA reconciliation of net assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 for the year ended December 31 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Gas Contracts 2022 Balance at beginning of period $ &#8212; &#160; Total realized/unrealized gains (losses): Included in regulatory assets 56 Balance at end of period $ 56 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSpecial Use Funds (PPL) \n\nThe special use funds are investments restricted for paying active union employee medical costs. In 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. The funds are invested primarily in commingled debt and equity funds measured at NAV and are classified as investments in equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the funds are recorded to the Statements of Income. \n\nPrice Risk Management Assets/Liabilities \n\nInterest Rate Swaps ( PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\n&#160; \n\nTo manage interest rate risk, PPL, LG&#38;E and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., LIBOR, SOFR, and government security rates), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3. \n\nGas Contracts (PPL) \n\nTo manage gas commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases, RIE utilizes over-the-counter (OTC) gas swaps contracts with pricing inputs obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), except in cases where the ICE publishes seasonal averages or where there were no transactions within the last seven days. RIE may utilize discounting based on quoted interest rate curves, including consideration of non-performance risk, and may include a liquidity reserve calculated based on bid/ask spread. Substantially all of these price curves are observable in the marketplace throughout at least 95% of the remaining contractual quantity, or they could be constructed from market observable curves with correlation coefficients of 95% or higher. These contracts are classified as Level 2. \n\nRIE also utilizes gas option and purchase and capacity transactions, which are valued based on internally developed models. Industry-standard valuation techniques, such as the Black-Scholes pricing model, are used for valuing such instruments. For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is classified as Level 3. This includes derivative instruments valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility, and contract duration. Such instruments are classified as Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. RIE considers non-performance risk and liquidity risk in the valuation of derivative instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3. \n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the gas derivative instruments are implied volatility and gas forward curves. A relative change in commodity price at various locations underlying the open positions can result in significantly different fair value estimates. \n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value (All Registrants) \n\nThe carrying amounts of long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below. Long-term debt is classified as Level 2. The effect of third-party credit enhancements is not included in the fair value measurement. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Carrying Amount (a) Fair Value Carrying Amount (a) Fair Value PPL $ 13,243 &#160; $ 12,239 &#160; $ 11,140 &#160; $ 12,955 &#160; PPL Electric 4,486 &#160; 4,259 &#160; 4,484 &#160; 5,272 &#160; LG&#38;E 2,307 &#160; 2,128 &#160; 2,006 &#160; 2,363 &#160; KU 2,920 &#160; 2,616 &#160; 2,618 &#160; 3,120 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Amounts are net of debt issuance costs. \n\nThe carrying amounts of other current financial instruments (except for long-term debt due within one year) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. \n\n&#160; \n\n18. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nRisk Management Objectives \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Senior Director-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level) and the coordination and reporting of the Enterprise Risk Management program. \n\nMarket Risk \n\nMarket risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric risks. Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Many of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected. \n\nThe following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n&#8226; PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. PPL and LG&#38;E utilize over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt. PPL, LG&#38;E and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuance. \n\n&#8226; PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the regulated utilities due to the recovery methods in place. \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nPPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below. \n\n&#8226; PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. \n\n&#8226; LG&#38;E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&#38;E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs. \n\n&#8226; RIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC- approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices. \n\nVolumetric Risk \n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below: \n\n&#8226; PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases. \n\n&#8226; RIE is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates. \n\nEquity Securities Price Risk \n\n&#8226; PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of the defined benefit plans' assets. This risk is significantly mitigated due to the recovery methods in place. \n\n&#8226; PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases. \n\nCredit Risk \n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance. \n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below. \n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E or KU defaults on its contractual obligation, those Registrants would need to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities. \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit. \n\nMaster Netting Arrangements (PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nNet derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements. \n\nPPL had $ 4 million cash collateral posted under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2022 and no cash collateral posted at December 31, 2021. \n\nPPL had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nLG&#38;E and KU had no cash collateral posted or obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nSee \"Offsetting Derivative Instruments\" below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate case. \n\nCash Flow Hedges (PPL) \n\nInterest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL had no such contracts at December 31, 2022. \n\nCash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring. \n\nFor 2022, 2021 and 2020, PPL had no cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the amount of accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months is insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded. \n\nEconomic Activity (PPL and LG&#38;E) \n\nLG&#38;E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including terminated swap contracts, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December 31, 2022, LG&#38;E held contracts with a notional amount of $ 64 million that mature in 2033. \n\nCommodity Price Risk (PPL) \n\nEconomic Activity \n\nRIE enters into financial and physical derivative contracts that economically hedge natural gas purchases. Realized gains and losses from the derivatives are recoverable through regulated rates, therefore subsequent changes in fair value are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as purchased gas. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Energy Purchases\" on the Statements of Income upon settlement of the contracts. At December 31, 2022, RIE held contracts with a notional amount of $ 15 million that mature in 2024. \n\nAccounting and Reporting \n\n(All Registrants) \n\nAll derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless the NPNS is elected. NPNS contracts include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LG&#38;E's interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. See Note 7 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nSee Note 1 for additional information on accounting policies related to derivative instruments. \n\n(PPL) \n\nThe following table presents the fair value and location of derivative instruments recorded on the Balance Sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Under the agreements, upon termination of the agreement as a result of a default or other termination event, the non-defaulting party typically would have a right to set off amounts owed under the agreement against any other obligations arising between the two parties (whether under the agreement or not), whether matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation. \n\nPPL, LG&#38;E and KU have elected not to offset derivative assets and liabilities and not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral pledged (an asset) or the obligation to return cash collateral received (a liability) under derivatives agreements. The table below summarizes the derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements and related cash collateral received or pledged. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Assets Liabilities &#160; &#160; Eligible for Offset &#160; &#160; Eligible for Offset &#160; &#160; Gross Derivative Instruments Cash Collateral Received Net Gross Derivative Instruments Cash Collateral Pledged Net December 31, 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivatives &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL $ 25 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 73 &#160; $ 62 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11 &#160; LG&#38;E &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivatives &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; PPL $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 18 &#160; LG&#38;E &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features \n\nCertain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, LG&#38;E and KU or certain of their subsidiaries. Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. \n\nAdditionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL's, LG&#38;E's and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties.

Asset Retirement Obligations \n\n(PPL and PPL Electric) \n\nPPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur. \n\n(PPL, LG&#38;E and KU) \n\nPPL's, LG&#38;E's and KU's ARO liabilities are primarily related to CCR closure costs. See Note 14 for information on the CCR rule. LG&#38;E also has AROs related to natural gas mains and wells. LG&#38;E's and KU's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements, which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property. Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets. For LG&#38;E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal. \n\nThe changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; PPL LG&#38;E KU &#160; 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 ARO at beginning of period $ 189 &#160; $ 182 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ 67 &#160; $ 105 &#160; $ 115 &#160; Acquisition of RIE (a) 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Accretion 6 &#160; 16 &#160; 3 &#160; 5 &#160; 3 &#160; 11 &#160; Obligations incurred 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Changes in estimated timing or cost 15 &#160; 56 &#160; 12 &#160; 40 &#160; 4 &#160; 16 &#160; Obligations settled ( 45 ) ( 65 ) ( 15 ) ( 28 ) ( 30 ) ( 37 ) ARO at end of period $ 177 &#160; $ 189 &#160; $ 86 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ 82 &#160; $ 105 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n21.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. \n\nPPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company \n\nThe Registrants' principal executive officers and principal financial officers, based on their evaluation of the Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to the Registrants and their consolidated subsidiaries is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, particularly during the period for which this annual report has been prepared. The aforementioned principal officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nPPL Corporation \n\nPPL acquired Narragansett Electric on May 25, 2022. Narragansett Electric is included in the 2022 financial statements as of the date of the acquisition and accounted for -5.8% of net income and 16.1% and 20.5% of consolidated total assets and net assets, respectively, of PPL Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2022. Due to the timing of deal close and Narragansett Electric&#8217;s heavily integrated systems and processes with National Grid, Narragansett Electric was excluded from a formal evaluation of effectiveness of PPL Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures. PPL is evaluating changes to processes, information technology systems and other components of internal controls over financial reporting as part of its ongoing integration activities. \n\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. \n\nPPL Corporation \n\nAs reported in the 2022 second quarter 10-Q, PPL's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that there was a change in PPL&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting resulting from the Narragansett Electric transaction during the second fiscal quarter that had a material effect on PPL&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. PPL's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that there were no other changes in the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting during the Registrant's full fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nPPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, Louisville Gas and Electric Company, and Kentucky Utilities Company \n\nThe Registrants' principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that there were no changes in the Registrants' internal control over financial reporting during the Registrants' fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants' internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nPPL Corporation \n\nPPL's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). PPL's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to PPL's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted \n\naccounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. \n\nIn accordance with SEC rules, management excluded Narragansett Electric from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting due to the timing of deal close and Narragansett Electric&#8217;s heavily integrated systems and processes with National Grid. Narragansett Electric accounted for -5.7% of net income and 15.9% and 20.5% of consolidated total assets and net assets, respectively, of PPL Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2022. As discussed above, PPL Corporation is evaluating changes to processes, information technology systems and other components of internal control over financial reporting as part of its ongoing integration activities. \n\nPPL Electric Utilities Corporation, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company \n\nManagement of PPL's non-accelerated filer companies, PPL Electric, LG&#38;E and KU, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). Each of the aforementioned companies' internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and Board of Directors of these companies regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of the companies listed above, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013), management of these companies concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. This annual report does not include an attestation report of Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, the companies' independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting for these non-accelerated filer companies. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the aforementioned companies was not subject to attestation by the companies' registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit these companies to provide only management's report in this annual report. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of PPL Corporation \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Narragansett Electric due to the timing of deal close and Narragansett Electric&#8217;s heavily integrated systems and processes with National Grid. Narragansett Electric accounted for -5.7% of net income and 15.9% and 20.5% of consolidated total assets and net assets, respectively, of PPL Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Narragansett Electric. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nMorristown, New Jersey \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 \n\n"
