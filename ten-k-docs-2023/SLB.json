In 2021, SLB became the first company in the energy services industry to commit to a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions target including all three emission scopes. By setting targets based on SLB&#8217;s total 2019 baseline GHG footprint&#8212;inclusive of Scope 3 emissions (which accounted for approximately 95% of SLB&#8217;s baseline)&#8212;and not just its Scope 1 and 2 footprint, SLB&#8217;s comprehensive emissions reduction roadmap addressees the entire oil and gas value chain.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB&#8217;s 2050 net zero target is supported by the following interim milestones, using 2019 as the baseline year:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\nby 2025, a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\nby 2030, a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\nby 2030, a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThere are three key components to SLB achieving the 2050 net-zero target: reducing operational emissions, reducing customer emissions that occur while using SLB technology, and taking carbon-negative actions of sufficient scale to offset any residual operating and technology emissions that the Company may have in 2050. SLB&#8217;s Scope 1 and 2 emissions primarily come from fuel use and \n\n&#160;\n\nelectricity consumption : Scope 3 emissions are indirect, such as emissions from customers&#8217; use of SLB technology and emissions from our use of third - party goods and services. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn tandem with our 2050 net-zero commitment, SLB introduced a portfolio of Transition Technologies in 2021. This portfolio includes a select group of products and services that quantifiably reduce our customers&#8217; GHG emissions footprint, while continuing to drive high performance, reliability and efficiency. This portfolio will be supported by an industry-leading impact quantification framework and is set to grow as sustainability is further embedded in the Company&#8217;s research and development process.\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile there is an ambitious path ahead, we are cementing our position as a sustainability leader today. SLB continues to be one of the highest-ranked companies in the energy industry across key environmental, social, and governance ratings agencies as of December 31, 2022. This recognition confirms the strategy we have in place and our commitment to leading change in the industry. \n\nHuman Capital\n\nAs a leading global technology company, with a workforce consisting of approximately 99,000 people in more than 100 countries, one of SLB&#8217;s greatest strengths is the diversity of our people. We believe that our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain a highly competent and diverse workforce has been paramount to our success for many decades. We recognize that cultivating diversity and promoting inclusion are essential to attracting the best talent from around the world and enabling creativity and innovation to drive business success.\n\n&#160;\n\nEnergy transition and changing geopolitics are increasingly impacting our people and customers. SLB is competitively well-positioned from both a people and technology perspective to manage these factors and capture the opportunity that it represents for SLB and the countries where we work.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur national and cultural diversity is based in our philosophy to recruit and develop people from the communities where we work. As a result, we maintain a workforce nationality mix aligned to the revenue derived from the countries in which we work, as reflected in the charts below. Our long-standing commitment to national and cultural diversity, which is seen throughout every layer of SLB, fosters a culture that is global in outlook, yet local in practice.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to national and cultural diversity, gender balance is an important part of our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. We are committed to leading our industry in gender diversity, and we are on track to reach our interim milestone of having women represent 25% of our salaried employees by 2025. Our next milestone is for women to comprise 30% of our salaried employees by 2030.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB is proud to provide a career platform that enables a culture of lifelong learning for all employees and is committed to offering borderless careers and making career decisions based on merit. SLB&#8217;s borderless career philosophy is powered by its talent and mobility practices, which offer employees multiple, flexible career paths to help them acquire the required skills to reach their potential. We provide continuous growth opportunities through a combination of learning and experience. SLB strives to identify talent early and to provide opportunities for those employees who demonstrate exceptional performance and the ability to progress to higher levels within the organization. These opportunities accelerate career development while fostering an agile workforce and the next generation of business leaders.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe principal methods of competition within the energy services industry are technological innovation, quality of service, and price differentiation. These factors vary geographically and are dependent upon the different services and products that SLB offers. SLB has numerous competitors, both large and small. \n\nIntellectual Property\n\nSLB owns or controls the industry&#8217;s leading portfolio of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information, trade secrets, and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to SLB&#8217;s business. While SLB seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to SLB&#8217;s business. \n\nSeasonality \n\nSeasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of SLB&#8217;s products and services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and other Northern climates and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia, and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for exploration data, software, and other products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of the year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. Conversely, customer budget constraints in North America may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of the year. \n\nCustomers\n\nSLB&#8217;s primary customers are national oil companies, large integrated oil companies and independent operators. No single customer exceeded 10% of SLB&#8217;s consolidated revenue during each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nGovernmental Regulations \n\nSLB is subject to numerous environmental and other governmental and regulatory requirements related to its operations worldwide.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nThe following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our &#8220;forward-looking statements,&#8221; which are discussed immediately following Item 7A. of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should also be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. \n\nBusiness and Operational Risks \n\nDemand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. Recent oil and gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has in the past had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nDemand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers&#8217; views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices, as well as our customers&#8217; ability to access capital. In addition, the transition of the global energy sector from primarily a fossil fuel-based system to renewable energy sources could affect our customers&#8217; levels of expenditures. \n\n&#160;\n\nActual and anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nHistorically, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nchanges in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic and business conditions&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nthe costs of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and gas&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the expanded alliance known as OPEC+ to set and maintain production levels for oil&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nthe level of oil and gas exploration and production activity&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nthe level of excess production capacity&#59; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nthe level of refining capacity&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nthe level of oil and gas inventories&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\naccess to potential resources&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\npolitical and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ngovernmental laws, policies, regulations, subsidies, and other actions, including initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources&#59;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and gas futures contracts&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption&#59; and\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nextreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and public health or similar issues, such as pandemics and epidemics. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge. Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services. A significant industry downturn, sustained market uncertainty, or increased availability of economical alternative energy sources could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. \n\n&#160;\n\nDisruptions in the political, regulatory, economic, and social environments of the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe are a global technology company, and our non-US operations accounted for approximately 84% of our consolidated revenue in 2022, 85% in 2021 and 81% in 2020. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we operate could result in business disruptions or operational challenges that may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, or our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nuncertain or volatile political, social, and economic conditions&#59;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nexposure to expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our assets or the assets of our customers, or other governmental actions&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nsocial unrest, acts of terrorism, war, or other armed conflict&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\npublic health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nconfiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ntheft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property&#59;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ndeprivation of contract rights&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ntrade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, or other regions or countries that could restrict or curtail our ability to operate in certain markets&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nunexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\nrestrictions on the repatriation of income or capital&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ncurrency exchange controls&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ninflation&#59; and\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226;\n\ncurrency exchange, rate fluctuations and devaluations. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs an example of a risk resulting from our global operations, in March 2022 we decided to immediately suspend new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. Russia represented approximately 6% of our worldwide revenue during 2022. The carrying value of our net assets in Russia was approximately $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. This consisted of $0.3 billion of receivables, $0.3 billion of fixed assets, $0.5 billion of current assets, and $0.4 billion of current liabilities.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe continue to actively monitor the dynamic situation in Ukraine and applicable laws, sanctions and trade control restrictions resulting from the conflict. The extent to which our operations and financial results may be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will depend on various factors, including the extent and duration of the conflict&#59; the effects of the conflict on regional and global economic and geopolitical conditions&#59; the effect of further laws, sanctions and trade control restrictions on our business, the global economy and global supply chains&#59; and the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the ruble. Continuation or escalation of the conflict may also aggravate this and other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, including cybersecurity, regulatory, and reputational risks.\n\n&#160;\n\nFailure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our technology portfolio to changing customer preferences and government requirements, developing solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations, and scaling innovative low-carbon and carbon-neutral technologies. If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to provide effective data security protection in connection with our digital technologies and services. We rely on information technology networks and systems for internal purposes, including secure data storage, processing, and transmission, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers. We also develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage our customers&#8217; information and data, external data, personal data, and our own data. Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we \n\n&#160;\n\nalso rely on third-party business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack. \n\n&#160;\n\nUnauthorized access to or modification of, or actions disabling our ability to obtain authorized access to, our customers&#8217; data, other external data, personal data, or our own data, as a result of a cyber incident, attack or exploitation of a security vulnerability, could result in significant damage to our reputation or disruption of the services we provide to our customers. In addition, allegations, reports, or concerns regarding vulnerabilities affecting our digital products or services could damage our reputation. This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, if our systems, or our third-party business associates&#8217; systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data&#59; breach of personal data&#59; interruption of our business operations&#59; increased legal and regulatory exposure, including fines and remediation costs&#59; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, business associates and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold. \n\nThe energy industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue developing and producing innovative technologies in response to changes in the market, including customer and government requirements, or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain, or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected. Furthermore, competing or new technologies may accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services and reduce the value of our intellectual property. \n\n&#160;\n\nLimitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold. \n\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets.\n\n&#160;\n\nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.\n\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \n\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nOur operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods and services to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors, or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of applicable laws, including anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material \n\n&#160;\n\nadverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships. \n\n&#160;\n\nExisting or future laws, regulations, court orders or other public- or private-sector initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change may reduce demand for our products and services. \n\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and proposed international agreements and national, regional, and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. The implementation of these agreements, including the Paris Agreement, the Europe Climate Law, and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, impose taxes on us or our customers, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions from our technologies or operations, or accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. As a result, we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of GHG emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change. \n\n&#160;\n\nThere is also increased focus by our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability, and energy transition matters. Actions to address these concerns or negative perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led to initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital. Any of these initiatives may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air and GHG emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals, and explosives. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent, and expensive to implement. These laws sometimes provide for &#8220;strict liability&#8221; for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe could be subject to substantial liability claims, including as a result of well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety, and environmental risks. Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development, and production environments. Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site or any loss of containment or well control, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused, and any resurgence of the pandemic could again cause, a significant reduction in global economic activity, significantly weakening demand for oil and gas, and in turn, for our products and services. Other effects of the pandemic included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets&#59; adverse revenue and net \n\n&#160;\n\nincome effects&#59; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities &#59; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production&#59; downward revisions to customer budgets&#59; limitations on access to sources of liquidity&#59; supply chain disruptions&#59; limitations on access to raw materials&#59; employee impacts from illness&#59; and local and regional closures or lockdowns, including temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the pandemic will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the continued severity of the pandemic, including any sustained geographic resurgence&#59; the emergence of new variants and strains of the COVID-19 virus&#59; and the success of actions to contain or treat the virus. COVID-19, and volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.\n\nWe have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our net-zero target and our energy transition strategy. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our contro l. Our targets are based on empirical data and estimates that reflect the current best practices for measuring or estimating emissions, but we anticipate that future innovations in both measurement technologies and estimation methodologies could cause us to revise our baseline as well as re-calculate progress toward our targets.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business faces increased scrutiny from certain investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. \n\n&#160;\n\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impede our operations.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel necessary for our businesses intensifies as activity increases, technology evolves and customer demands change. In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations.\n\nSevere weather events, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results. \n\nOur business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather events in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding, landslides, and heat waves have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites, or result in disruptions of our customers&#8217; operations. Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities. In addition, acute or chronic physical impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities. Any such extreme weather events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue. \n\n&#160;\n\n"

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K.\n\n&#160;\n\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparison between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of SLB&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n2022 Executive Overview \n\nWe delivered strong fourth quarter results and concluded a remarkable year for SLB with great success. Full-year 2022 revenue of $28.1 billion increased 23% year on year. All Divisions and geographical areas experienced double digit revenue growth.\n\n&#160;\n\n2022 was transformative for SLB as we set new safety, operational, and performance benchmarks for our customers and strengthened our market position both internationally and in North America. We launched our bold new brand identity, reinforcing our leadership position in energy technology, digital, and sustainability, and demonstrated our ability to deliver superior earnings in this early phase of a structural upcycle in energy.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn North America, we seized the growth cycle throughout the year, increased our pretax operating margins close to 600 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;), and almost doubled our pretax operating income. We effectively harnessed our refocused portfolio, fit-for-basin technology, and performance differentiation to gain greater market access and improved pricing, particularly in the drilling markets where we significantly outperformed rig count growth. Today, we have built one of the highest-quality oilfield services and equipment businesses in North America through the implementation of our returns-focused strategy.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn the international markets, after a first half of the year that was impacted by geopolitical conflict and supply chain bottlenecks, activity began to visibly expand in the second half of the year, resulting in full year revenue growth of 20% and margin expansion of more than 150 bps. We laid the foundation for further growth and margin expansion through pricing improvements and a solid pipeline of incremental contract awards. In the Middle East, SLB is well positioned to be a key beneficiary of this visible market expansion, and we expect record levels of upstream investment by national oil companies to continue in the next few years. During the year, we secured a sizeable share of tender awards in the region, driven by our differentiated performance, fit-for-purpose technology, and best-in-class local content. Similarly, across offshore basins, we continue to consolidate our advantaged position with new contract awards, particularly in Latin America and Africa.\n\n&#160;\n\nBeyond our financial results, we made significant progress in our sustainability initiatives during the year, including launching several new Transition Technologies to support the decarbonization of oil and gas. Our Transition Technologies portfolio revenue grew more than 30% year-on-year, and we project it will cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.\n\n&#160;\n\nFinally, we initiated increased returns to shareholders, demonstrating confidence in our strategy, our financial outperformance, and our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase in January 2023, and we resumed our share buyback program in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fourth quarter affirmed a distinctive new phase in the upcycle with the much-anticipated acceleration of activity in the Middle East, as revenue in the region increased by double digits. Offshore activity continued to strengthen, partially offset by seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, the US land rig count remains at robust levels, although the pace of growth is moderating. Additionally, pricing continues to trend favorably, extending beyond North America and into the international regions, supported by new technology and very tight equipment and service capacity in certain markets.\n\n&#160;\n\nThese activity dynamics, improved pricing, and our commercial success&#8212;particularly in the Middle East, offshore, and North American markets&#8212;combine to set a very strong foundation for outperformance in 2023. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe strengthened our balance by reducing our net debt by $1.7 billion to $9.3 billion, its lowest level since the second quarter of 2016, and repaid approximately $1.7 billion of gross debt during the year.\n\n&#160;\n\nLooking ahead, we believe the macro backdrop and market fundamentals that underpin a strong multi-year upcycle for energy remain very compelling in both oil and gas and in low-carbon energy resources. First, oil and gas demand is forecasted by the International Energy Agency (&#8220;IEA&#8221;) to grow by 1.7 million barrels per day in 2023 despite concerns for a potential economic slowdown in certain regions. In parallel, markets remain very tightly supplied. Second, energy security is prompting a sense of urgency to make further investments to ensure capacity expansion and diversity of supply. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate with significant digital technology advancements, favorable government policy support, and increased spending on low-carbon initiatives and resources.\n\n&#160;\n\nBased on these factors, global upstream spending projections continue to trend positively. Activity growth is expected to be broad-based, marked by an acceleration in international basins. These positive activity dynamics will be amplified by higher service pricing \n\n&#160;\n\nand tighter service sector capacity. T he impact of loosening COVID -19 restrictions and an earlier than expected reopening of China could support further upside potential over 2023 . \n\n&#160;\n\nOverall, the combination of these effects will result in a very favorable mix for SLB with significant growth opportunities in our Core, Digital, and New Energy and we expect another year of very strong growth and margin expansion. \n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Results \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(Stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFourth Quarter 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThird Quarter 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPretax\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPretax\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome\n\n&#160;\n\nDigital &#38; Integration\n\n$\n\n1,012\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nReservoir Performance\n\n&#160;\n\n1,554\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,456\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWell Construction\n\n&#160;\n\n3,229\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,084\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProduction Systems\n\n&#160;\n\n2,215\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,150\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEliminations &#38; other\n\n&#160;\n\n(131\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(24\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(113\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(37\n\n)\n\nPretax segment operating income\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,557\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,400\n\n&#160;\n\nCorporate &#38; other (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(169\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(155\n\n)\n\nInterest income (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInterest expense (3) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(118\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(119\n\n)\n\nCharges &#38; credits (4) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n7,879\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,347\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n7,477\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,134\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nComprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nExcludes interest income included in the segments&#8217; income (fourth quarter 2022: $19 million&#59; third quarter 2022: $25 million). \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nExcludes interest expense included in the segments&#8217; income (fourth quarter 2022: $3 million&#59; third quarter 2022: $3 million). \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (4) \n\nCharges &#38; credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nFourth-quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially.

This revenue increase was led by the Middle East &#38; Asia and Latin America, both of which grew 7%. In North America, revenue of $1.6 billion increased 6% sequentially driven by strong year-end exploration data licensing sales in the US Gulf of Mexico boosting North America offshore revenue. US land revenue increased 4% sequentially due to drilling revenue growth, which outperformed the rig count growth.\n\n&#160;\n\nFourth-quarter pretax segment operating margin of 19.8% was the highest since 2015. \n\nDigital &#38; Integration \n\nDigital &#38; Integration fourth-quarter revenue of $1.0 billion increased 12% sequentially, propelled by the year-end exploration data licensing sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and Africa&#59; increased Asset Performance Solutions (&#8220;APS&#8221;) project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally.\n\n&#160;\n\nDigital &#38; Integration pretax operating margin of 38% expanded 386 bps sequentially, due to improved profitability in exploration data licensing and digital solutions.\n\nReservoir Performance \n\nReservoir Performance revenue of $1.6 billion increased 7% sequentially from new projects and activity gains internationally, particularly in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n&#160;\n\nReservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 18% expanded 146 bps sequentially.

During 2021, SLB sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and recognized a gain of $28 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB&#8217;s functional currency in Argentina is the US dollar and it uses Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate to remeasure its Argentine peso-denominated net assets into US dollars. The Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain currency controls that limit SLB&#8217;s ability to access US dollars in Argentina and remit cash from its Argentine operations. A legal indirect foreign exchange mechanism exists-in the form of capital market transactions known as Blue Chip Swaps, which effectively results in a parallel US dollar exchange rate. This parallel rate, which cannot be used as the basis to remeasure SLB&#8217;s net monetary assets in US dollars under US GAAP, was approximately 93% higher than Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB entered into Blue Chip Swap transactions that resulted in a loss of $139 million. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB&#8217;s peso-denominated net assets in Argentina were approximately $40 million at December 31, 2022 (as compared to approximately $270 million at September 30, 2022), primarily consisting of cash. If Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate converges with the parallel rate, SLB would incur a loss on its peso-denominated net assets in Argentina. Additionally, SLB may enter into further Blue Chip Swap transactions in the future. Argentina represented less than 5% of SLB&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB has an investment in the Arabian Drilling Company (&#8220;ADC&#8221;), an onshore and offshore gas and oil rig drilling company in Saudi Arabia, that it accounts for under the equity method. During the fourth quarter of 2022, ADC completed an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;). In connection with the IPO, SLB sold a portion of its interest in a secondary offering that resulted in SLB receiving net proceeds of $223 million. As a result of these transactions, SLB&#8217;s ownership interest in ADC decreased from 49% to approximately 34%. SLB recognized a gain of $ 107 million, representing the gain on the sale of a portion of its interest as well as the effect of the ownership dilution of its equity investment due to the IPO. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in earnings of equity method investments in 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily due to SLB&#8217;s investment in Liberty, as Liberty experienced net losses in 2021 as compared to net income in 2022, as well as higher earnings from SLB&#8217;s investment in ADC.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in interest income was primarily driven by the effect of higher cash and short-term investment balances and interest rates in Argentina. This increase was more than offset by approximately $100 million of foreign exchange losses recorded during 2022 ($13 \n\n&#160;\n\nmillion during 2021) relating to the remeasurement of Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets as the official Argentine peso exchange rate devalue d compared to the US dollar throughout 2022 . \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring 2022, SLB sold certain real estate and recognized a gain of $43 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB repurchased $395 million of its 3.75% Senior Notes due 2024 and $409 million of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 for $790 million, resulting in a gain of $11 million after considering the write-off of the related deferred financing fees and other costs.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring 2021, a start-up company that SLB previously invested in was acquired. As a result of this transaction, SLB&#8217;s ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. SLB recognized an unrealized pretax gain of $47 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value of approximately $55 million. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense of $490 million in 2022 decreased $49 million compared to 2021 primarily as a result of the repayment of $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion of debt during 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOther \n\nResearch &#38; engineering and General &#38; administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nResearch &#38; engineering \n\n&#160;\n\n2.3\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2.4\n\n%\n\nGeneral &#38; administrative \n\n&#160;\n\n1.3\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.5\n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe SLB effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the SLB effective tax rate generally decreases. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the SLB effective tax rate generally increases. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe effective tax rate was 18% in 2022 as compared to 19% in 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . These charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2022 by approximately one percentage point.\n\nCharges and Credits \n\nSLB recorded charges and credits during 2022 and 2021.

investments. Management believes that Net debt provides useful information regarding the level of SLB&#8217;s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ( 2 ) \n\nIncludes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs and APS investments. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ( 3 ) \n\n&#8220;Free cash flow&#8221; represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nKey liquidity events during 2022 and 2021 included: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCash flow from operations of $3.7 billion in 2022 decreased approximately $1.0 billion as compared to 2021. This decrease was primarily due to working capital consuming $1.7 billion of liquidity in 2022 compared to $45 million in 2021. The increase in working capital was largely the result of receivables increasing $1.7 billion (32%) and inventories increasing $0.7 billion (22%), respectively, from 2021 to 2022, while these balances were relatively flat at the end of 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in receivables was driven primarily by the fact that SLB&#8217;s fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 27% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in inventories was a result of the significant activity growth that SLB experienced in 2022 that is expected to continue in 2023. These increases in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities that were a source of cash of $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to $0.2 billion in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in working capital in 2022 was partially offset by the effects of a $1.3 billion increase in net income, excluding the effects of the previously mentioned charges and credits (which had no impact on cash flow from operations), in 2022 as compared to 2021. In addition, cash flow from operations in 2021 benefited from a federal tax refund of $477 million relating to the carryback of US net operating losses pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nIn April 2022, SLB announced a 40% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.125 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.175 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in July 2022. Dividends paid during 2022 and 2021 were $0.8 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. In January 2023, SLB announced a further 43% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.175 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.25 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in April 2023. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nOn January 21, 2016, the SLB Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for SLB common stock. SLB had repurchased $1.0 billion of SLB common stock under this program as of December 31, 2022. SLB did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2022 and 2021. SLB resumed repurchases under this program in the first quarter of 2023. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nCapital investments (consisting of capital expenditures, APS investments and exploration data capitalized) were $2.3 billion in 2022 and $1.7 billion in 2021. Capital investments during 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion as SLB continues to support the strong revenue growth that is expected to continue in 2023. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring 2022, SLB sold 47.8 million of its shares of Liberty and received proceeds of $732 million. During 2021, SLB sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and received proceeds of $109 million. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB repurchased $395 million of its 3.75% Senior Notes due 2024 and $409 million of its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025 for $790 million. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB sold a portion of its equity interest in ADC in a secondary offering that resulted in SLB receiving net proceeds of $223 million. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, SLB sold certain real estate and received proceeds of $120 million. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, SLB deposited sufficient funds with the trustee for its $1.0 billion of 2.40% Senior Notes due 2022 to satisfy and discharge all of its obligations relating to such notes. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, SLB repurchased all $665 million of its 3.30% Senior Notes due 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, SLB had $2.89 billion of cash and short-term investments and committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $6.55 billion, all of which was available and unused. SLB believes these amounts, along with cash generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to meet future business requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table

Note 13, Leases of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding SLB&#8217;s lease obligations.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where SLB operates. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires SLB to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve &#8220;critical accounting estimates&#8221; because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by SLB about matters that are inherently uncertain. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nSLB maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Adjustments \n\n&#160;\n\nto the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of SLB &#8217;s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, SLB has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable. During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, SLB typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables. However, except for a $469 million accounts receivable write-off during 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in Venezuela, SLB has not historically had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable. SLB has a global footprint in more than 100 countries. As of December 31, 2022, three of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of SLB&#8217;s net accounts receivable balance, of which only two (the United States and Mexico) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables.\n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in Receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 is approximately $1.0 billion of receivables relating to Mexico. SLB&#8217;s receivables from its primary customer in Mexico are not in dispute and SLB has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer.\n\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets \n\nSLB records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of SLB&#8217;s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. \n\n&#160;\n\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, SLB has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, SLB determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if SLB concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2022. Based on this assessment, SLB concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required.\n\n&#160;\n\nLong-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets, and investments in APS projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset&#8217;s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, SLB could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nSLB conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. SLB&#8217;s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. SLB recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are judgmental and are made based upon prior experience, and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, SLB will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. \n\nRevenue Recognition for Certain Long-term Construction-type Contracts\n\nSLB recognizes revenue for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications. Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. Approximately 5% of SLB&#8217;s revenue in 2022, 6% in 2021, and 5% in 2020, was recognized under this method.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.\n\n&#160;\n\nPension and Postretirement Benefits \n\nSLB&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe discount rate that SLB uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by SLB for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nThe discount rate utilized to determine the liability for SLB&#8217;s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 5.50% at December 31, 2022 and 3.00% at December 31, 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nThe weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for SLB&#8217;s international pension plans was 5.41% at December 31, 2022 and 2.83% at December 31, 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nThe discount rate utilized to determine expense for SLB&#8217;s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 3.00% in 2022 and 2.60% in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nThe weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for SLB&#8217;s international pension plans was 2.83% in 2022 and 2.38% in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe expected rate of return for SLB&#8217;s retirement benefit plans represents the long-term average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets based on expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset allocation and related historical rate of return. The average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 4.40% in 2022 and 6.60% in 2021. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 5.05% in 2022 and 6.73% in 2021. A lower expected rate of return increases pension expense. \n\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for SLB&#8217;s United States and international pension plans: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEffect on\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEffect on 2022\n\n&#160;\n\nDec. 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\nChange in Assumption \n\nPretax Expense\n\n&#160;\n\nObligation\n\n&#160;\n\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n\n+$31\n\n&#160;\n\n+$334\n\n&#160;\n\n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n\n-$30\n\n&#160;\n\n-$321\n\n&#160;\n\n25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets\n\n+$38\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets\n\n-$38\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for SLB&#8217;s United States postretirement medical plans: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEffect on\n\n&#160;\n\nEffect on 2022\n\n&#160;\n\nDec. 31, 2022\n\nChange in Assumption \n\nPretax Expense\n\n&#160;\n\nObligation\n\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n\n-$3\n\n&#160;\n\n+$23\n\n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n\n+$3\n\n&#160;\n\n-$22\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n"

      "text": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nSLB is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB&#8217;s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. Approximately 72% of SLB&#8217;s revenue in 2022 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of SLB&#8217;s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which SLB conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB is exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. SLB uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to provide a hedge against these cash flow risks and effectively convert the debt to US-dollar denominated fixed rate debt.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings. SLB enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities, and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\n\n&#160;\n\nA 10% appreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of SLB&#8217;s forward contracts by $28 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of SLB&#8217;s forward contracts by $36 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $7.2 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $5.1 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. \n\nForward-Looking Statements \n\nThis Form 10-K, as well as other statements we make, contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which include any statements that are not historical facts. Such statements often contain words such as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;projected,&#8221; &#8220;projections,&#8221; &#8220;precursor,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;expectations,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;ambition,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;scheduled,&#8221; &#8220;think,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;likely,&#8221; and other similar words. Forward-looking statements address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, such as statements about SLB&#8217;s financial and performance targets and other forecasts or expectations regarding, or dependent on, its business outlook&#59; growth for SLB as a whole and for each of its Divisions (and for specified business lines, geographic areas or technologies within each Division)&#59; oil and natural gas demand and production growth&#59; oil and natural gas prices&#59; forecasts or expectations regarding energy transition and global climate change&#59; improvements in operating procedures and technology&#59; capital expenditures by SLB and the oil and gas industry&#59; the business strategies of SLB, including digital and &#8220;fit for basin,&#8221; as well as the strategies of SLB&#8217;s customers&#59; SLB&#8217;s effective tax rate&#59; SLB&#8217;s APS projects, joint ventures, and other alliances&#59; SLB&#8217;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its preparedness for other widespread health emergencies&#59; the impact of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine on global energy supply&#59; access to raw materials&#59; future global economic and geopolitical conditions&#59; future liquidity&#59; and future results of operations, such as margin levels. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changing global economic and geopolitical conditions&#59; changes in exploration and production spending by SLB&#8217;s customers and changes in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development&#59; the results of operations and financial condition of SLB&#8217;s customers and suppliers&#59; SLB&#8217;s inability to achieve its financial and performance targets and other forecasts and expectations&#59; SLB&#8217;s inability to achieve net-zero carbon emissions goals or interim emissions reduction goals&#59; general economic, geopolitical and business conditions in key regions of the world&#59; the ongoing conflict in Ukraine&#59; foreign currency risk&#59; inflation&#59; changes in monetary policy by governments&#59; pricing pressure&#59; weather and seasonal factors&#59; unfavorable effects of health pandemics&#59; availability and cost of raw materials&#59; operational modifications, delays or cancellations&#59; challenges in SLB&#8217;s supply chain&#59; production declines&#59; the extent of future charges&#59; SLB&#8217;s inability to recognize efficiencies and other intended benefits from its business strategies and initiatives, such as digital or new energy, as well as its cost reduction strategies&#59; changes in government regulations and regulatory requirements, including those related to offshore oil and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals and climate-related initiatives&#59; the inability of technology to meet new challenges in exploration&#59; the competitiveness of alternative energy sources or product substitutes&#59; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this Form 10-K and other filings that we make with the SEC. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of any such development changes), or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking and other statements in this Form 10-K regarding our environmental, social, and other sustainability plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental, social, and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Statements in this Form 10-K are made as of January 25, 2023, and SLB disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n&#160;\n\n"

Statements \n\n&#160;\n\n1. Business Description \n\nSchlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V., incorporated in Cura&#231;ao) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;SLB&#8221;) form a global technology company that drives energy innovation for a balanced planet. With a global footprint in more than 100 countries and employees representing almost twice as many nationalities, SLB works each day on innovating oil and gas, delivering digital at scale, decarbonizing industries, and developing and scaling new energy systems that accelerate the energy transition.\n\n2. Summary of Accounting Policies \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of SLB have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, SLB evaluates its estimates, including those related to collectibility of accounts receivable&#59; revenue recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time&#59; recoverability of fixed assets, goodwill, intangible assets, Asset Performance Solutions investments, and investments in affiliates&#59; income taxes&#59; exploration data&#59; contingencies and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. SLB bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nSLB recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for these products or services. The vast majority of SLB&#8217;s services and product offerings are short-term in nature. The time between invoicing and when payment is due under these arrangements is generally between 30 to 60 days .\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue is recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications. Revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs may be required as work progresses. Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of work as stipulated in the contract. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.\n\n&#160;\n\nDue to the nature of its businesses, SLB does not have significant backlog. Total backlog was $ 3.0 billion at December 31, 2022, of which approximately 60 % is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2023. \n\nShort-term Investments \n\nShort-term investments are comprised primarily of money market funds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds, and notes, substantially all of which are denominated in US dollars and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows , SLB does not consider Short-term investments to be cash equivalents. \n\nInvestments in Affiliated Companies \n\nInvestments in companies in which SLB does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. SLB&#8217;s share of the after-tax earnings of equity method investees is included in Interest &#38; other income . Investments in privately held companies in which SLB does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in publicly traded companies in which SLB does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Interest &#38; other income .\n\nExploration Data \n\nSLB&#8217;s exploration data library consists of completed and in-process seismic surveys that are licensed on a nonexclusive basis. SLB capitalizes costs directly incurred in acquiring and processing the exploration data. Such costs are charged to Cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that SLB expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, an individual survey generally will not carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe carrying value of the exploration data library is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicating impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future cash flows, which involve significant judgment on the part of SLB, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in SLB&#8217;s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. \n\nAsset Performance Solutions\n\nAsset Performance Solutions (&#8220;APS&#8221;) projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customers&#8217; assets under long-term agreements. SLB invests its own services and products into the field development activities and operations and is compensated on a fee-per-barrel basis or based on cash flow generated. This includes certain arrangements whereby SLB is only compensated based on incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB capitalizes its investments in a project including the direct costs associated with providing its services or products. These capitalized investments are amortized to the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) as the related production is achieved based on the units of production method, whereby each unit produced is assigned a pro-rata portion of the unamortized costs based on estimated total production, resulting in a matching of revenue with the applicable costs. &#160; \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \n\nSLB&#8217;s assets that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, receivables from clients and derivative financial instruments. SLB places its cash and short-term investments with financial institutions and corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them. SLB regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures, SLB exposes itself to some credit risk. SLB minimizes this credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs a large multinational company, SLB&#8217;s accounts receivable are spread over many countries and customers. The United States and Mexico represented 13 % and 14 %, respectively, of SLB&#8217;s net accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2022. No other countries accounted for greater than 10% of SLB&#8217;s accounts receivable balance.

(&#8220;Liberty&#8221;) in exchange for an equity interest in Liberty. During 2022, SLB sold 47.8 million of its shares of Liberty and received proceeds of $ 730 million. These transactions resulted in gains of $ 325 million. As of December 31, 2022, SLB had a 5 % equity interest in Liberty. Based on the quoted market prices of Liberty&#8217;s shares, the fair value of SLB&#8217;s investment in Liberty was approximately $ 144 million as of December 31, 2022. SLB accounts for its investment in Liberty under the equity method of accounting and records its share of Liberty&#8217;s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nThe Central Bank of Argentina maintains certain currency controls that limit SLB&#8217;s ability to access US dollars in Argentina and remit cash from its Argentine operations. A legal indirect foreign exchange mechanism exists, in the form of capital market transactions known as Blue Chip Swaps, which effectively results in a parallel US dollar exchange rate. This parallel rate, which cannot be used as the basis to remeasure SLB&#8217;s Argentine peso-denominated net monetary assets in US dollars under US GAAP, was approximately 93 % higher than Argentina&#8217;s official exchange rate at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB entered into Blue Chip Swap transactions that resulted in a loss of $ 139 million. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, SLB repurchased $ 395 million of its 3.75 % Senior Notes due 2024 and $ 409 million of its 4.00 % Senior Notes due 2025 for $ 790 million, resulting in a gain of $ 11 million after considering the write-off of the related deferred financing fees and other costs. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSLB has an investment in the Arabian Drilling Company (&#8220;ADC&#8221;), an onshore and offshore gas and oil rig drilling company in Saudi Arabia, that it accounts for under the equity method. During the fourth quarter of 2022, ADC completed an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;). In connection with the IPO, SLB sold a portion of its interest in a secondary offering that resulted in SLB receiving net proceeds of $ 223 million. As a result of these transactions, SLB&#8217;s ownership interest in ADC decreased from 49 % to approximately 34 %. SLB recognized a gain of $ 107 million, representing the gain on the sale of a portion of its interest as well as the effect of the ownership dilution of its equity investment due to the IPO. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of SLB&#8217;s investment in ADC, based on the quoted market price of ADC&#8217;s shares, was approximately $ 930 million and the carrying value of its investment was $ 556 million.

As a result, SLB&#8217;s market capitalization deteriorated significantly compared to the end of 2019. SLB&#8217;s stock price reached a low during the first quarter of 2020 not seen since 1995. Additionally, the Philadelphia Oil Services Sector index, which is comprised of companies involved in the oil services sector, reached an all-time low. As a result of these facts, SLB determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of its reporting units was less than their carrying value. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nTherefore, SLB performed an interim goodwill impairment test, which resulted in a $ 3.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. SLB used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, but also considered the market approach to validate the results. The income approach estimates the fair value by discounting each reporting unit&#8217;s estimated future cash flows using SLB&#8217;s estimate of the discount rate, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results. The market approach involves significant judgement involved in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples.\n\n&#160;\n\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows for each reporting unit and the discount rate. SLB selected the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates. SLB&#8217;s estimates were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe discount rates utilized to value SLB&#8217;s reporting units were between 12.0 % and 13.5 %, depending on the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit as well as the size of the reporting unit. Assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a 50 -basis point increase or \n\n&#160;\n\ndecrease in the discount rate assumptions would have changed the fair value of the seven reporting units, on average, by less than 5 %. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nThe negative market indicators described above were triggering events that indicated that certain of SLB&#8217;s long-lived intangible and tangible assets may have been impaired. Recoverability testing indicated that certain long-lived assets were impaired. The estimated fair value of these assets was determined to be below their carrying value. As a result, SLB recorded the following impairment charges: \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 3.3 billion relating to intangible assets, of which $ 2.2 billion relates to SLB&#8217;s 2016 acquisition of Cameron International Corporation and $ 1.1 billion relates to SLB&#8217;s 2010 acquisition of Smith International, Inc. Following this impairment charge, the carrying value of the impaired intangible assets was approximately $ 0.9 billion. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 1.3 billion relating to the carrying value of certain APS projects in North America. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 0.6 billion of fixed assets associated with the pressure pumping business in North America. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n$ 202 million of severance. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n$ 79 million of other restructuring charges, primarily consisting of the impairment of an equity method investment that was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\n$ 164 million relating to a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSecond quarter 2020:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAs previously noted, late in the first quarter of 2020 geopolitical events that increased the supply of low-priced oil to the global market occurred at the same time as demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a collapse in oil prices. As a result, the second quarter of 2020 was the most challenging quarter in decades. SLB responded to these market conditions by taking actions to restructure its business and rationalize its asset base during the second quarter of 2020. These actions included reducing headcount, closing facilities, and exiting business lines in certain countries. Additionally, due to the resulting activity decline, SLB had assets that would no longer be utilized. As a consequence of these circumstances and decisions, SLB recorded the following restructuring and asset impairment charges: \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 1.021 billion of severance associated with reducing its workforce by more than 21,000 employees. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 730 million relating to the carrying value of certain APS projects in Latin America. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 666 million of fixed asset impairments primarily relating to equipment that would no longer be utilized and facilities it exited. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 603 million write-down of the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 311 million write-down of right-of-use assets under operating leases associated with leased facilities SLB exited and excess equipment. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 205 million of costs associated with exiting certain activities. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 156 million impairment of certain exploration data. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 60 million of other costs, including a $ 42 million increase in the allowance for the doubtful accounts. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSLB repurchased all $ 600 million of its 4.20 % Senior Notes due 2021 and $ 935 million of its 3.30 % Senior Notes due 2021 . SLB paid a premium of $ 40 million in connection with these repurchases. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nAs a consequence of the workforce reductions described above, SLB recorded a curtailment gain of $ 69 million relating to its US postretirement medical plan. See Note 16 &#8211; Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans for further details. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThird quarter 2020:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nSLB recorded the following restructuring charges: \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 254 million of facility exit charges as SLB continued to rationalize its real estate footprint relating to both leased and owned facilities. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 63 million of severance. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n- \n\n$ 33 million of other charges. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFourth quarter 2020:\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nOn December 31, 2020, SLB contributed its OneStim business to Liberty in exchange for a 37 % equity interest in Liberty. As a result of this transaction, SLB recognized a gain of $ 104 million. This gain is classified in Interest &#38; other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, a start-up company that SLB previously invested in completed an initial public offering. As a result, SLB recognized an unrealized gain of $ 39 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its fair value of approximately $ 43 million. This unrealized gain is reflected in Interest &#38; other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) . SLB sold its interest in this company during 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, SLB entered into an agreement to purchase new software licenses. This transaction rendered certain previously purchased licenses obsolete. As a result, SLB wrote off the remaining $ 62 million of net book value associated with the obsolete software licenses. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fair value of certain of the assets impaired during 2020 was estimated based on the present value of projected future cash flows that the underlying assets are expected to generate.

These committed facilities support commercial paper programs in the United States and Europe, of which &#160; $ 750 million matures in February 2024, $ 2.0 billion matures in February 2025, $ 1.0 billion matures in July 2026, and $ 2.0 billion in February 2027. SLB also has a &#8364; 750 million three-year committed revolving credit facility that matures in June 2024 . At December 31, 2022, no amounts had been drawn under this facility. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary by facility.\n\n&#160;\n\nCommercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the extent they are backed up by available and unused committed credit facilities maturing in more than one year and to the extent it is SLB&#8217;s intent to maintain these obligations for longer than one year. There were no borrowings under the commercial paper programs at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nLong-term Debt as of December 31, 2022 is due as follows: $ 0.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.0 billion in 2025, $ 1.7 billion in 2026, $ 1.0 billion in 2027, $ 1.5 billion in 2028, $ 0.8 billion in 2029 and $ 3.7 billion thereafter. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fair value of SLB&#8217;s Long-term Debt at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was $ 9.4 billion and $ 13.9 billion, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices. \n\n&#160;\n\nSchlumberger Limited fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by certain of its subsidiaries, including securities issued by Schlumberger Investment SA and Schlumberger Finance Canada Ltd., both indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger Limited.\n\n9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nSLB&#8217;s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. Approximately 72 % of SLB&#8217;s revenues in 2022 were denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of SLB&#8217;s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which SLB conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase (decrease).\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB is exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. SLB uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to provide a hedge against these cash flow risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the fair value of the derivative recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. \n\n&#160;\n\nDetails regarding SLB&#8217;s outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nDuring 2019, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of SLB issued &#8364; 1.5 billion of Euro-denominated debt.

SLB entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of its $ 0.5 billion 1.40 % Senior Notes due 2025. These cross-currency interest rate swaps effectively convert the US dollar notes to Canadian dollar denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate of 1.73 % .\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nA summary of the amounts included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet relating to cross currency interest rate swaps follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(Stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDec. 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDec. 31, 2021\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Assets \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Liabilities \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fair values were determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived or corroborated by observable data.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB had derivative contracts in place that hedged the price of oil related to approximately 75 % of the projected oil production for 2022 for one of its APS projects. During 2022, SLB entered into derivative contracts that hedge the price of oil relating to approximately 70 % of the projected oil production for the first six months of 2023 and approximately 30% of the projected oil production for the last six months of 2023 for the same project. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency. SLB uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n\n&#160;\n\nSLB is also exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. While SLB uses foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to certain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Instead, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss), as are changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Transaction losses of $ 96 million in 2022, $ 23 million in 2021, and $ 21 million in 2020 were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) net of related hedging activities.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nForeign currency forward contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.7 billion in various foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther than the previously mentioned cross-currency interest rate swaps, the fair value of the other outstanding derivatives was no t material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as hedges and those not designated as hedges on the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) was as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(Stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGain (Loss) Recognized in Income (Loss)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidated Statement\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nof Income (Loss) Classification\n\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCross-currency interest rate swaps\n\n$\n\n( 254 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 422 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCost of services/sales\n\nCross-currency interest rate swaps\n\n&#160;\n\n( 88 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 83 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 63 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\nInterest expense\n\nCommodity contracts\n\n&#160;\n\n( 87 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue\n\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n&#160;\n\n( 30 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 5 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\nCost of services/sales\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 459 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 500 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDerivatives not designated as hedges:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nForeign exchange contracts\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 11 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n( 29 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\nCost of services/sales\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSLB does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.\n\n&#160;\n\n10.

Stock-based Compensation Plans \n\nSLB has three types of stock-based compensation programs: (i) a restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit program (collectively referred to as &#8220;restricted stock&#8221;), (ii) a discounted stock purchase plan (&#8220;DSPP&#8221;), and (iii) stock options. \n\nRestricted Stock \n\nSLB grants performance share units to certain key employees. The number of shares earned is determined at the end of each performance period based on SLB&#8217;s achievement of certain predefined targets as described in the underlying performance share unit agreement. In the event SLB exceeds the predefined target, shares for up to a maximum of 250 % of the target award may be awarded. In the event SLB falls below the predefined target, a reduced number of shares may be awarded. If SLB falls below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be awarded. As of December 31, 2022, 3.9 million performance share units were outstanding assuming the achievement of 100% of target.\n\n&#160;\n\nAll other restricted stock awards generally vest at the end of three years or vest ratably in equal tranches over a three-year period. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted stock awards do not pay dividends or have voting rights prior to vesting. Accordingly, the fair value of a restricted stock award is generally the quoted market price of SLB&#8217;s stock on the date of grant less the present value of the expected dividends not received prior to vesting.\n\nThe following table summarizes information related to restricted stock activity: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(Shares stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAverage\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAverage\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAverage\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGrant Date\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGrant Date\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGrant Date\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value\n\n&#160;\n\nUnvested at beginning of year\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n29.03 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n35.24 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n49.86 \n\n&#160;\n\nGranted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n36.16 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n25.16 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n26.53 \n\n&#160;\n\nAdjustments for performance achieved\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n35.55 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\nVested\n\n&#160;\n\n( 13 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n32.42 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 5 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n48.44 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 3 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n71.56 \n\n&#160;\n\nForfeited\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 1 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n45.95 \n\n&#160;\n\nUnvested at year-end\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n30.24 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n29.03 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n35.24 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nDiscounted Stock Purchase Plan \n\nUnder the terms of the DSPP, employees can choose to have a portion of their earnings withheld, subject to certain restrictions, to purchase SLB common stock.

SLB&#8217;s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates.\n\n&#160;\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (Stated in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBalance at beginning of year\n\n$\n\n1,001 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,271 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,301 \n\n&#160;\n\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nImpact of changes in exchange rates\n\n&#160;\n\n( 38 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 24 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 3 \n\n)\n\nSettlements with tax authorities\n\n&#160;\n\n( 37 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 49 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 15 \n\n)\n\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n\n&#160;\n\n( 94 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 228 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 87 \n\n)\n\nReductions due to the lapse of statute of limitations\n\n&#160;\n\n( 44 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 26 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 79 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,001 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,271 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe amounts above exclude accrued interest and penalties of $ 155 million, $ 164 million and $ 184 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Accordingly, SLB recorded a curtailment gain of $ 69 million during the second quarter of 2020 relating to this plan. The curtailment gain includes recognition of the decrease in the benefit obligation as well as a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service credit, reflecting the reduction in expected years of future service.

SLB&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\n&#160;\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n&#160;\n\nSLB management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment SLB&#8217;s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe effectiveness of SLB&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders \n\nof Schlumberger Limited \n\n&#160;\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\n&#160;\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company&#59; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company&#59; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, \n\n&#160;\n\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relate s . \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities, and those audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment applied by management in determining these liabilities including a high degree of estimation uncertainty due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management&#8217;s estimates.\n\n&#160;\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of uncertain tax positions. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating management&#8217;s process for determining the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, (ii) testing the completeness and reasonableness of uncertain tax positions recorded in the consolidated financial statements, and (iii) evaluating assessments received from the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used by management, including management&#8217;s assessment of whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\n&#160;\n\nHouston, Texas \n\nJanuary 25, 2023\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1952. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n"

Controls and Procedures. \n\nSLB has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of SLB&#8217;s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and the Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), of the effectiveness of SLB&#8217;s &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures&#8221; (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, SLB&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that SLB files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms. SLB&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed so that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There has been no change in SLB&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, SLB&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"

Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (&#8220;NIOC&#8221;). \n\nSLB&#8217;s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran in 2022 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain non-US subsidiaries of SLB maintained depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (&#8220;Saderat&#8221;), and at Bank Tejarat (&#8220;Tejarat&#8221;) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of SLB for services rendered in Iran prior to the wind-down and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintained an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes. SLB anticipates that it will discontinue dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to SLB for prior services rendered in Iran.\n\n"
