(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#8220;S&#38;P Global,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; the &#8220;Registrant,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, automotive and engineering markets.

We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December of 1925 under the laws of the state of New York. \n\nOur Businesses \n\nOur operations consist of six reportable segments: S&#38;P Global Market Intelligence (&#8220;Market Intelligence&#8221;), S&#38;P Global Ratings (&#8220;Ratings\"), S&#38;P Global Commodity Insights (&#8220;Commodity Insights&#8221;), S&#38;P Global Mobility (&#8220;Mobility&#8221;), S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices (&#8220;Indices&#8221;) and S&#38;P Global Engineering Solutions (&#8220;Engineering Solutions&#8221;). For a discussion on the competitive conditions and regulatory environment associated with our businesses, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Segment Review&#8221; contained in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nOn February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit Ltd. (&#8220;IHS Markit&#8221;) by acquiring 100% of the IHS Markit common stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition, and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&#38;P Global, and the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 include the financial results of IHS Markit from the date of acquisition. The merger with IHS Markit, a world leader in critical information, analytics, and solutions for the major industries and markets that drive economies, brings together two world-class organizations with leading brands and capabilities across information services that will be uniquely positioned to serve, facilitate and power the markets of the future. \n\nMarket Intelligence \n\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.

They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default. \n\nWith offices in over 25 countries around the world, Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets.

Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with: \n\n&#8226; ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and \n\n&#8226; bank loan ratings. \n\nNon-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. \n\nCommodity Insights \n\nCommodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.

Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources: \n\n&#8226; Investment vehicles &#8212; asset-linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds; \n\n&#8226; Exchange traded derivatives &#8212; generate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges; \n\n&#8226; Index-related licensing fees &#8212; fixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and \n\n&#8226; Data and customized index subscription fees &#8212; fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research. \n\nEngineering Solutions \n\nEngineering Solutions is a leading provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge.

L.P. (&#8220;KKR&#8221;) to sell our Engineering Solutions business for $975 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We currently anticipate the divestiture to result in after-tax proceeds of approximately $750 million, which proceeds are expected to be used for share repurchases. The agreement follows our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit. The transaction, which is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfying other customary closing conditions, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023. \n\nSegment and Geographic Data \n\nThe relative contribution of our reportable segments to operating revenue, operating profit, long-lived assets and geographic area for the three years ended December 31, 2022 are included in Note 12 &#8211; Segment and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 39,950 permanent employees located worldwide, including around 21,750 in Asia, 11,750 in the U.S. and Canada, 5,700 in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and 750 in Latin America. \n\nWe invest in our success as a global Company by investing in our employees across the world through our &#8220;people first&#8221; approach to human capital management, aimed at supporting everyone who works for us to reach their full potential. \n\nBoard Oversight &#38; Management Implementation of Human Capital Strategy \n\nOur Board of Directors and Company management view effective human capital management as critical to the Company&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. \n\nAs a result, the Board of Directors and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee oversee and regularly engage with our CEO, Chief Purpose Officer, Chief Corporate Responsibility &#38; Diversity Officer and other members of senior leadership on a broad range of people topics, including: culture and purpose; talent attraction and development; succession planning; compensation and benefits; diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\"); workplace health, safety and well-being; and employee engagement and retention . \n\nAt the management level, our Chief Purpose Officer is responsible for leading the development and execution of the Company&#8217;s human capital management strategy, also referred to as our &#8220;People&#8221; strategy, working together with other senior leaders across the Company. Among other things, this includes promoting an inclusive and performance-driven workplace culture with equitable opportunity for all; managing the Company&#8217;s initiatives to attract, develop, engage and retain the high-quality talent needed to ensure S&#38;P Global is equipped with the right skillsets and intellectual capital to deliver on current and future business needs; and overseeing the design of the Company&#8217;s compensation, benefits and well-being programs. In connection with these responsibilities, the Chief Purpose Officer also partners with our Corporate Responsibility &#38; Diversity, Equity &#38; Inclusion team on the development and execution of the Company&#8217;s diversity, equity and inclusion roadmap and works closely with the CEO on executive succession planning and development of the talent succession pipeline for the Company&#8217;s Executive Committee. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s short-term incentive plan further reflects the significant role our people play in driving our enterprise strategy to Power Global Markets by linking executive pay outcomes under our enterprise and division balanced scorecards to the achievement of strategic people priorities . In 2022, we focused on delivering on the following strategic People priorities across the enterprise: \n\n&#8226; Roll out and embed our new purpose and values across the combined company \n\n&#8226; Encourage career mobility and career development through career coaching and Thrive, our performance management experience \n\n&#8226; Improve diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention, while continuing to raise awareness through DEI education \n\n&#8226; Attract and retain our people through recognition programs, learning opportunities, and fair compensation \n\nTo achieve our strategic people objectives, we support our employees through human capital management strategies that include diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; learning and development programs; competitive compensation and benefits programs; hybrid work, benefits and well-being programs; and talent attraction, retention and engagement. Examples of some of our key initiatives and programs in these focus areas are included below. \n\nDiversity, Equity &#38; Inclusion \n\nOur ability to attract and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to our long-term strategy, driving business growth and innovation and empowering our people to achieve their full potential. In connection with our commitment to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, we have taken the following steps to foster an environment where our people can bring their whole selves to work: \n\n&#8226; An executive DEI Council, co-chaired by our CEO and Chief Purpose Officer, directs and oversees our enterprise-wide DEI strategy, advancing and ensuring coordination and accountability for DEI programs across the organization. In 2021, we also designed a new and improved DEI governance model for the larger combined organization following the close of the merger with IHS Markit to align on strategy and prioritization; improve connectivity and create a defined and well-coordinated feedback loop between the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the executive DEI Council, Employee Resource Groups and People leaders; and enhance accountability. \n\n&#8226; We measure progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, which are reviewed by the CEO quarterly and the Board at least biannually, and impact short-term incentive compensation. Key Performance Indicators under our incentive scorecards for tracking and ensuring accountability for DEI progress include measuring the net change in the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of the S&#38;P Global employee population and DEI specific sentiment through the annual VIBE employee engagement survey. \n\n&#8226; We connect colleagues across our organization through our Employee Resource Groups. These global and employee-led networks offer career experiences and network-building opportunities that foster professional development and support workplace diversity. \n\n&#8226; To improve our pipeline of diverse talent, we have expanded our partnerships in diverse talent recruitment with select Historically Black Colleges and Universities, upgraded interview training to incorporate awareness of unconscious bias, and expanded career mentoring and leadership development opportunities for diverse colleagues. We are also including diversity and inclusion as an integral part of our Global Mobility strategy. \n\nLearning and Development Programs \n\nWe support our employees in pursuing their professional goals with growing investments in personalized development. We provide a wide array of global training and learning programs to help employees expand their knowledge, skills and experience and guide career advancement, including: \n\n&#8226; Technology Training - We offer internal technology training programs to enhance the technology skills of our workforce and accelerate our ability to solve complex problems using a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development and technology education for all employees. \n\n&#8226; Career Coaching - We launched a career coaching program, offering customized support through global career coaches, to empower people to take ownership of their career and help them navigate their career path and opportunities to grow within S&#38;P Global. \n\n&#8226; Leadership Development - We invest in developing leaders at all levels of our organization through targeted programs designed to foster leadership excellence in people managers, develop emerging leaders and strengthen our executive talent bench, providing a robust internal succession pipeline for our Executive Committee. \n\nCompetitive Compensation Programs \n\nWe believe compensation and recognition programs are critical to the overall people experience. Offering market competitive, people-centric and performance-driven compensation is key to our recruitment, talent management and retention strategies. As a result, management regularly assesses employee feedback, competitor research, and market data to ensure our programs remain competitive, equitable, and are designed with our people&#8217;s financial and social well-being in mind. Based on these insights, each year we continue to introduce new and enhanced &#8220;people first&#8221; capabilities in support of our philosophy. Our compensation program consists of a mix of: \n\n&#8226; Annual Salary where base pay is determined by role, scope, external market rate and internal parity relative to geographic location. Recognizes level of proficiency and skill exhibited as compared to role requirements. \n\n&#8226; Annual Bonus as a cash reward acting as our main pay-for-performance vehicle through annual programs. Recognizes achievement against individual, team, and group performance. \n\n&#8226; Equity awards for our strategic leaders acknowledging achievements of individual and organizational goals typically in recognition of contributions that positively influence strategic growth, operational alignment, and product innovation. \n\nIn 2022, we broadened initiatives to increase pay transparency, empowering our people leaders to manage pay conversations in an effort to continue attracting and retaining top talent. \n\nHybrid Work, Benefits, and Well-being \n\nThe health, safety and well-being of our people working around the globe is a top priority, and our facilities worldwide follow rigorous, internally and externally audited, occupational health and safety policies. \n\nIn early 2022, most of our employees remained working from home and we introduced a new flexible return to office model via a phased approach called anchor-flex. This model was not mandated as a full return, rather defining regular days our people might be in the office and those where they would work virtually. Throughout, we continued to promote health, safety and the welfare of our people. \n\nWe focused on the well-being of our people aligned to our &#8220;people first&#8221; philosophy through expansion of our benefits offerings globally: \n\n&#8226; Recharge, flexible and unlimited time off to balance your work and life in order to maximize the effectiveness of both. \n\n&#8226; Parental leave of 26 weeks to bond with new arrivals. \n\n&#8226; 10 days of paid leave per calendar year to care for a close relative or loved one who has a serious illness or health condition. \n\n&#8226; sick leave for a minimum of 10 business days or your local statutory timeframe. \n\n&#8226; flexible paid compassion leave following the loss of a loved one, based on individual needs and circumstances. \n\n&#8226; three months&#8217; pay to family members following the loss of an employee. \n\nS&#38;P Global offers well-being programs that enrich work-life experiences and help our people prioritize their mental, physical, financial, and social wellbeing. Some of our inclusive benefits include: \n\n&#8226; Wellbeing Program support and resources focused on physical and mental wellbeing including fitness classes, mental health programs, and education on topics such as Mental Health, Preventative Health, Family Issues, DEI, and Professional Skills Development. \n\n&#8226; Wellbeing Reimbursement of team members for wellbeing-related activities, providing the flexibility for team members to decide how to use their wellbeing reimbursement to meet their specific wellness needs. \n\nRetention and Engagement \n\nIn order to attract and retain the high-quality talent needed to execute our long-term strategy of Powering Global Markets, we believe it is critical for our people to feel motivated and empowered. As a result, we strive to create a unified and inclusive workplace culture that promotes employee engagement, satisfaction and performance; and that reflects our common corporate purpose and values. \n\nWe invite employee feedback through a variety of channels for open communication and engagement, including small group employee round-table discussions with our business leaders and members of our Board of Directors, our annual VIBE employee engagement survey, as well as more frequent check-ins through employee &#8220;Pulse&#8221; surveys. The annual VIBE survey allows us to track progress in critical areas, such as workplace pride and satisfaction and inclusive culture, and gather actionable insights for improvements to our people strategy. We encourage managers to share VIBE survey results with their teams, prioritize action areas and pursue solutions. To reinforce management accountability, we also track employee survey scores in our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, with outcomes against survey engagement targets impacting short-term incentive outcomes. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nS&#38;P Global's investor relations website provides access to Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, earnings releases and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. \n\nWe operate in the capital, commodities, automotive and engineering markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals &#38; steel and agriculture; the automotive markets include manufacturers, suppliers, dealerships and service shops; and the engineering markets include engineers, builders, and architects. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable Company-wide. \n\nCybersecurity, Technology and Innovation Risks \n\nOur size, scale and role in the global markets puts us at greater risk for cyber attacks and other cyber-security risks. Our systems and those of our third-party service providers are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information, including material non-public information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors. \n\n&#8226; Our businesses often have access to material non-public information concerning the Company&#8217;s customers, including sovereigns, public and private companies, and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers&#8217; securities and could damage such customers&#8217; competitive positions. Some of our own products and services also include material non-public information that could affect trading markets. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks, including attacks carried out by state-sponsored actors, intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, our impending methodology changes in our benchmarks businesses, or the composition of our indices. Unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their or our own confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us. \n\n&#8226; We and our third-party service providers, including our vendors, experience cyber attacks and data breaches of varying degrees on a regular basis. Breaches of our or our third-party service providers&#8217; systems and networks, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such third-party service providers&#8217; websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers. Although there has not been a cyber attack or data breach on the Company or its third-party service providers that has had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future. \n\n&#8226; In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software. While such vulnerabilities have not resulted in a material adverse effect on the Company to date, they require us to devote \n\ntime and resources to remediation on a regular basis. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a material adverse effect resulting from vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software. \n\n&#8226; Misappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information, including personal data, due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches, or the perception of such an occurrence, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones, result in financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and lead to increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such incidents. \n\n&#8226; We are exposed to additional cyber security risks as we continue our integration with IHS Markit Ltd. (&#8220;IHS Markit&#8221;) following our merger, as described in the risk factor below entitled &#8220;The process of integrating the businesses of S&#38;P Global and IHS Markit following the Merger involves significant costs, resources and challenges, which may materially adversely impact the anticipated synergies of the Merger and our business, financial condition and results of operations.&#8221; \n\n&#8226; Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. \n\n&#8226; Measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete. \n\n&#8226; Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and include denial of service attacks, ransomware, phishing attacks and payment fraud. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched. \n\n&#8226; Given our businesses are often privy to material non-public information concerning our customers, our data could be improperly used, including for insider trading by our employees and third-party vendors with access to key systems. We have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past, and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors. We take precautions to detect and prevent such activity, including implementing and training on insider trading policies for our employees and contractual obligations for our third-party vendors, but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct. Any breach of our clients&#8217; confidences as a result of employee or third-party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation. \n\n&#8226; While we conduct cyber due diligence during the acquisition process, following the completion of acquisitions, we have identified weaknesses and vulnerabilities in acquired entities&#8217; information systems, which expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyber attack. \n\n&#8226; Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nThe markets in which we operate continuously change to adapt to customer needs. Our inability to innovate and compete with new or enhanced products and services of our competitors could impact our profitability. \n\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that continuously change to adapt to customer needs. We could experience material threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in innovation, new offerings and enhancements, including new ways to deliver our products and services. These new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments sometimes do not, and may not in the future, achieve market acceptance, profit or the level of profitability that we have experienced historically. \n\nOur ability to develop, adapt, or implement new and improved processes and technology may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner. \n\n&#8226; Innovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts. While we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements, new processes and technologies that are still in development tend to be subject to more risks than established processes and technologies. For instance, certain of our new processes require manual data entry or collection before they can be automated, which subjects them to greater risk of human error. We may also face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting \n\nmanagement time and energy from other businesses. The foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in business being disrupted for a period of time as well as additional commitments of financial resources. \n\n&#8226; We are transitioning our technology to cloud-based infrastructure, which is complex, time consuming, and can involve substantial expenditures. Our utilization of cloud services is critical to developing and providing products and services to our customers, scaling our business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating our business; any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. We may discover deficiencies in our design or implementation or maintenance of the new cloud-based systems that could adversely affect our business. Any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems, and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers. \n\n&#8226; Enhancing existing products and developing new products often requires effective collaboration across various divisions, functions and business lines of the Company. Ineffective or insufficient collaboration across divisions, functions and business lines decreases our ability to expand geographically, enhance products, innovate, increase sales, leads to brand confusion and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\nIncreased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nIn recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software is expected to continue. Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services. Demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. Although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools and applications, if a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and increased costs. \n\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow adoption of AI in our products and services. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Emerging AI applications may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets and machine learning models, and development of new approaches and processes, which may be costly and could impact our profit margin. Developing, testing, and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems. \n\nOur use of open source software could result in litigation or impose unanticipated restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services. \n\nWe use open source software in our technology, most often as small components within a larger product or service. Open source code is also contained in some third-party software we rely on. The terms of many open source licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by U.S. or other courts. These licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services, licenses the software on unfavorable terms, or requires us to re-engineer our products and services or take other remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of licenses, which could be costly for us to defend. \n\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position. \n\n&#8226; We consider many of our products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position. \n\n&#8226; Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and \n\nmisappropriation. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. For example, we do business in a number of countries included on the Priority Watch List maintained by the Office of the United States Trade Representative which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions. The lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in such jurisdictions increases our vulnerability as regards unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermines our competitive position. In addition, even in jurisdictions where there are strong protections for intellectual property rights, our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be impacted by the number of competitors attempting to infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. \n\n&#8226; Our products also contain intellectual property of third-party sources. Any claims by third parties that we violated their intellectual property rights could result in termination of the relevant source agreement, litigation or reputational damage, or may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or to stop selling or redesign affected products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nWe rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. \n\n&#8226; Many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation. Delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. \n\n&#8226; In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers. Although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information. \n\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices. \n\n&#8226; This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful. \n\n&#8226; We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems. \n\n&#8226; The physical or technological infrastructure used by us or our third-party service providers can become obsolete or restrictive, unavailable, incompatible with future versions of our products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, or fail to operate effectively, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace it. \n\n&#8226; We also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons&#8217; ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer. \n\n&#8226; We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \n\nChanges in the global privacy, data localization and data protection legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results. \n\n&#8226; Global privacy, data localization and data protection legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures have been, and we expect will continue to be, significant. In addition, an inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations despite our best efforts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. \n\n&#8226; Certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in all our businesses, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy and data protection advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters as well as data protection, particularly as they relate to individual privacy and perceived national security interests. \n\n&#8226; There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., the European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;), the People&#8217;s Republic of China and elsewhere could have a significant impact on our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees, vendors and customers and other data. \n\n&#8226; Failure to comply with privacy and data protection requirements could result in significant penalties. The EU&#8217;s comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), for example, provides for penalties of up to the greater of &#8364;20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. Such laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, are costly to comply with, increase our operating costs and require significant management time and attention, and may result in negative publicity and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. \n\n&#8226; We devote meaningful time and financial resources to compliance with current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and related laws. We have made, and expect to continue to make, capital investments and other expenditures to address cybersecurity preparedness and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Any such expenses that we incur in the future, which could be material, will impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, but they may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. \n\n&#8226; In addition, the EU and other jurisdictions, including the People&#8217;s Republic of China and India, are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions, including in relation to cross-border transfers of personal and other types of data. These requirements are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which results in greater compliance risk and cost for us. \n\n&#8226; Continued privacy and data protection concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers&#8217; needs. \n\n&#8226; We are also from time to time subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal and other data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices. \n\nExposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; In the normal course of business, both in the U.S. and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future. \n\n&#8226; Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries regularly relate to the activity of our Ratings, Indices, and Commodity Insights businesses. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated activities, antitrust matters, and other matters, such as ESG. From time to time, we also face proceedings, investigations or inquiries related to tax matters. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries impose additional expenses on the Company, require the attention of senior management, and could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot \n\nprovide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. \n\n&#8226; Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the Company in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, especially abrupt changes, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, such as financial services regulatory reform, energy or commodity-specific regulation, including oil, regulations related to pricing providers, sustainability, credit rating data, data privacy and cyber security, government-sponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy (including sanctions), could impact our business. There are currently a number of laws and regulations in the EU, the U.K., the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate that have recently been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered to which we or our clients will or may become subject, but at this time their impact on our business and results of operations remains uncertain. Changes in legislation, regulation or policy increase the likelihood that we will fail to appropriately adapt to changes in our compliance obligations, particularly when such changes happen abruptly, such as following a change in government. Any of the foregoing changes could increase our litigation and regulatory exposure, directly impact our results of operations and cash flows, adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services, or adversely impact the demand for our products and services. Such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate. At this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows. \n\nIncreasing regulation of our Ratings business in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The businesses conducted by Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the &#8220;Reform Act&#8221;), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. \n\n&#8226; In the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (\"IOSCO\"), the SEC, the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority (\"ESMA\") and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), as well as regulators in other countries in which Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. \n\n&#8226; These laws and regulations, and any other similar future rule-making, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses and/or take actions inconsistent with our business objectives in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers&#8217; businesses, and they may affect Ratings&#8217; communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which Ratings&#8217; ratings are developed, affect the manner in which Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments could increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized. \n\n&#8226; Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nOur Indices and Commodity Insights businesses are subject to new and evolving regulatory regimes in the EU, the U.K. and Australia and the potential for increased or changing regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere. Our Indices business is subject to evolving regulatory regimes in the EU, the U.K. and Australia. Our Commodity Insights business is subject to regulatory regimes in the EU and the U.K. This evolving regulatory landscape can increase our exposure, compliance risk and costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries. \n\n&#8226; In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Commodity Insights has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks. \n\n&#8226; In July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (\"Financial Benchmark Principles\"), which are intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmarks by setting standards related to benchmark governance, benchmark quality, transparency and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices and benchmarks published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles. \n\n&#8226; The benchmark industry is subject to regulation in the EU (the &#8220;EU Benchmark Regulation&#8221;) and the U.K. (the &#8220;U.K. Benchmark Regulation&#8221;) as well as the evolving regulation of financial and commodity benchmarks in other jurisdictions. Indices and Commodity Insights are both supervised by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets for the EU Benchmark Regulation. Indices is also supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority for the U.K. Benchmark Regulation. This legislation has and may continue to cause operating obligations, increased compliance risk and additional costs for Indices and Commodity Insights. \n\n&#8226; Indices is subject to the benchmark regulation in Australia under which it is required to and has obtained a license from and is subject to the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission regarding its administration of the S&#38;P ASX 200 index. This legislation has and may continue to cause increased compliance risk and additional costs for Indices. \n\n&#8226; The EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively \"MiFID II\") have applied in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) mandate conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks for the purposes of clearing related securities and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses for this purpose; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venues that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research from other services, including execution services, and direct that investment firms must pay for research either out of a dedicated research payment account which is paid for by clients or from the investment firm&#8217;s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the EU Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011, or EMIR). MiFID II and potential subsequent amendments may result in changes to the manner in which Indices and Commodity Insights license their indices and price assessments, respectively, and could also have an indirect impact on the credit ratings and third-party research products offered by other divisions of the Company for use within the EU. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (&#8220;MAR&#8221;) may impose additional regulatory burdens on the activities of Indices and Commodity Insights in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known. \n\nOur international business activities must comport with international trade restraints, including economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, which could affect our ability to market and/or sell our products and services into certain countries where we do business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; As a global company, we are subject to international trade restraints, including economic and financial sanction laws and embargoes. These laws include prohibitions or restrictions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities. \n\n&#8226; Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws have affected, and may in the future affect, our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies and in turn adversely impact our revenue from such geographies. For example, in response to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, governments in the U.S., the EU, the United Kingdom (the &#8220;U.K.&#8221;), Canada and others have imposed financial and economic sanctions on certain industry segments and various parties in Russia and Belarus. We announced our suspension of commercial operations in Russia and Belarus in March 2022. Suspending our operations in those jurisdictions has \n\nimpacted revenue, particularly in Commodity Insights, though it has not had a material effect on the Company's results of operations. However, the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, and its continuation, or further escalation, could have additional adverse impacts our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Additional international trade restraints may be promulgated at any time and may require changes to our operations and increase our risk of noncompliance. \n\n&#8226; Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has previously settled and paid fines in connection with such matters. \n\nWe may become subject to liability or face reputational harm based on the use of our products by our clients. \n\n&#8226; Some of our products support the investment processes and other activities of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage or own trillions of dollars of assets. The use of our products as part of such activities, including the investment process, from time to time exposes us to claims for significant dollar amounts by our clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients. Such claims have not materially adversely affected us to date, but there can be no assurance that future claims will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The products we develop or license, and the proprietary methodologies, models and processes on which these products rely, from time to time contain undetected errors or defects, despite testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Such errors may exist during any part of a product&#8217;s life cycle and may persist notwithstanding testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Ineffective or insufficient collaboration within the Company increases the risk that such errors may not be detected. Deploying products containing such errors may damage our reputation, and the costs associated with remediating such errors may have an impact on our profitability. \n\n&#8226; Any claim relating to our products, even one in which the outcome is ultimately favorable to us, involves a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nRegulatory changes and economic conditions relating to the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe U.K.&#8217;s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020 (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;) has created legal uncertainty as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and the EU determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the U.K. Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in Europe. Potential changes in EU regulation, divergent interpretations by the U.K. of any replicated EU laws and/or additional regulation in the U.K. could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nBusiness and Operational Risks \n\nChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the United States (the &#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and world commodity and financial markets. \n\n&#8226; Economic conditions and volatility across the globe are generally affected by negative or uncertain economic and political conditions. In addition, natural and man-made disasters, the outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, and military conflict, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets and negatively impact general economic conditions. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, increased volatility or an economic slowdown in any of those markets have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations. For example, the adverse and uncertain economic conditions resulting from the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine have and may further negatively impact global demand for goods and services; cause supply chain disruptions; increase costs for transportation, energy and other raw materials; cause significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets; and cause an increase in cyber security incidents. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to this military conflict and/or its expansion could result in increased volatility and disruption to the global economy and the markets in which we operate, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Since a significant component of our credit-rating and issuance based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers&#8217; willingness or ability to issue such securities tend to reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Ratings provides credit ratings. \n\n&#8226; Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt or equity securities or reduce issuers&#8217; willingness or ability to issue such securities negatively impact the revenue of certain business lines within Market Intelligence that are linked to debt and equity issuances. \n\n&#8226; Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels or notional values of investment products based on our indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor&#8217;s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product. \n\n&#8226; Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, which have historically impacted our Ratings segment and portions of our Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Indices segments, and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our Commodity Insights business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets. Such volatility in our key markets, including the energy industry, has historically caused, and could in the future cause, reduced demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins. Changes in commodity price references, whether price assessments, benchmarks or the related trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\n&#8226; Increases in interest rates, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, and other market and economic factors may impact the supply and demand for new and used vehicles, which could have a negative impact on our Mobility business. \n\n&#8226; Volatility in the automotive supply chain impacts production in the automotive industry, and could have an adverse effect on the revenue of our Mobility business. \n\n&#8226; Any weakness in the macroeconomic environment, including due to recession, inflation, increasing interest rates and other factors, could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products. \n\n&#8226; The foregoing factors generally affect our performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nPandemics, epidemics or public health crises, including COVID-19, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The restriction in human mobility caused by such an event, or the steps governments take to prevent or contain such an event (such as travel restrictions, social distancing, quarantines, shelter in place orders or business shutdowns), may negatively impact our operations, or the operations of our suppliers or customers, or may limit our ability to interact with customers and effectively maintain and grow our operations, including through securing new subscriptions and renewals. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced, and future pandemics, epidemics and public health crises may introduce, volatility and uncertainty into the global financial and commodities markets and adverse general economic conditions. Risks posed to our businesses, financial condition and results of operations from volatility in the financial and commodities markets that could result from such an event, including COVID-19, are described in the risk factor above entitled &#8220;Changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.&#8221; Actions taken by governments to stabilize the markets and support economic growth may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. The negative impact of a pandemic, epidemic or public health crisis, such as COVID-19, on our clients could result in our products and services facing pricing pressure or delayed renewals, and challenges to new sales, which would in turn reduce revenue, ultimately impacting our results of operations. For example, the uncertainty created by COVID-19 and other macroeconomic events has, and may continue to, put pressure on Commodity Insights clients, which has, and may continue to, translate into slower demand for our subscription and related products and services. Moreover, if a pandemic, epidemic or public health crisis, including COVID-19, caused prolonged recessions in the U.S. and other major markets, our businesses would be materially and adversely affected. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the uncertain nature of COVID-19 and other pandemics, epidemics and public health crises, we cannot predict the extent to which any such event may impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nInability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nThe development, maintenance, sale and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees. Accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting, retaining and training talented employees in a highly competitive business environment. Our ability to attract and retain talented employees is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. While we offer competitive salary and benefit packages, we are facing challenges attracting and retaining talented employees due to strong competition for employees within our markets and increased compensation costs, which have been influenced by both the strong competition for employees within our markets and the current inflationary pressures. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to attract or retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nThe process of integrating the businesses of S&#38;P Global and IHS Markit following the Merger involves significant costs, resources and challenges, which may materially adversely impact the anticipated synergies of the Merger and our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses, and we have devoted, and we expect to continue to devote, significant resources, in connection with the integration of a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of S&#38;P Global and IHS Markit following the merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) between a subsidiary of the Company and IHS Markit. Management faces significant challenges in continuing to implement such integration, some of which may be beyond management&#8217;s control and which may result in increased costs and diversion of management&#8217;s time and energy, and which may materially adversely impact the anticipated synergies of the Merger and our business, financial condition and results of operations. The integration process and other disruptions, including increased cyber security risk, resulting from the Merger may also adversely affect our relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors and others with whom S&#38;P Global and IHS Markit have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses of S&#38;P Global and IHS Markit could harm our business or reputation. \n\n&#8226; The incremental costs associated with the integration of IHS Markit may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the event there are material unanticipated costs. Factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. \n\nOur acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company. For example, on February 28, 2022, we completed our Merger with IHS Markit, and as a condition of securing regulatory approval for the Merger, we were required to divest CUSIP Global Services, our Leveraged Commentary and Data (&#8220;LCD&#8221;) business and a related family of leveraged loan indices. On June 1, 2022, we also sold our Base Chemicals business, which we acquired in our Merger, to News Corp; such sale was also required as a condition of securing regulatory approval for the Merger. Additionally, on November 30, 2022, we announced our intention to divest our Engineering Solutions business, and on January 17, 2023, we announced that we entered into a Securities and Asset Purchase Agreement with Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &#38; Co. L.P., to sell the division for approximately $975 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The divestiture of our Engineering Solutions business is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks, as the market for acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions. \n\n&#8226; If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions face difficulties, including, but not limited to, the following: \n\n&#9702; the process of integration being more expensive or requiring more resources than anticipated; \n\n&#9702; an acquisition changing the composition of our markets and product mix (for example, the Merger exposed us to the automotive industry and the upstream exploration and production industry), and difficulty gaining the skills necessary for such markets or products; \n\n&#9702; delays or difficulties consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including issues in integrating financial reporting, information technology infrastructure, data and content management systems and product platforms, communications and other systems; \n\n&#9702; delays or difficulties harmonizing corporate cultures, operating practices, management philosophies, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, compliance programs and other policies, procedures and processes; \n\n&#9702; assuming unintended liabilities; \n\n&#9702; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; \n\n&#9702; failure to maintain employee morale or retain key personnel of the current or acquired business; \n\n&#9702; failure to retain existing business and operational relationships; \n\n&#9702; difficulty coordinating geographically separate organizations, including consolidating offices; \n\n&#9702; the impact of divestitures on our revenue growth being larger than projected due to greater dis-synergies or adverse effects on our overall product offerings than expected; \n\n&#9702; divestitures requiring continued financial involvement in the divested business through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations; \n\n&#9702; incurring impairment charges or other losses related to divestitures; and \n\n&#9702; diversion of management&#8217;s focus from other business operations. \n\n&#8226; Moreover, we may face regulatory challenges that impact our ability to conduct due diligence. For example, notwithstanding extensive integration planning, given the restrictions imposed by antitrust regulations, we did not have full access to IHS Markit data prior to the completion of the Merger. We relied on third-parties, clean rooms and publicly available data to inform our assumptions about the business. Since closing of the Merger, we have adjusted some of our assumptions based on full access to IHS Markit. While such adjustments have not been material to date, there can be no assurance that future discoveries will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the cost or revenue synergies or other benefits we expect from the Merger. \n\n&#8226; The failure of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive, and our inability to successfully compete could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The markets for credit ratings, financial research, market data and solutions, index-based products, automotive data, and commodities analytics and price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. Ratings, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights, Indices and Mobility compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of their offerings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. \n\n&#8226; While our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers (including exchanges), we also face competition from non-traditional providers, many of whom are our clients, such as asset managers, investment banks, private equity and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses. \n\n&#8226; The competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic partnerships, which results in competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies. \n\n&#8226; In addition, in some of the countries in which our businesses operate, governments have, and may in the future, provide financial or other support to locally-based competitors (particularly credit rating agencies) and have, and may from time to time in the future, establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria, benchmarks or benchmark providers, or procedures for evaluating local issuers. \n\n&#8226; If we are not able to successfully compete with our competitors, we may be required to significantly reduce the costs for our products or services, or we may lose significant market share, revenue or customers, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nA significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. \n\n&#8226; Our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments. \n\n&#8226; We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and post-retirement benefits and inflation, any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require, and competition for talented employees within our markets. We are currently facing increased compensation costs, which have been influenced by strong competition for employees within our markets and the current inflationary pressures. \n\n&#8226; We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues. \n\n&#8226; We rely on data provided by third-party data suppliers for a variety of our products and we rely significantly on Amazon Web Services (&#8220;AWS&#8221;) to provide, develop and maintain our cloud infrastructure. We are facing increasing costs from our third-party service providers due to a number of reasons, including inflationary pressures and costs associated with the increasing complexity of the data we require. \n\n&#8226; Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability or effectiveness of these investments. \n\n&#8226; A significant increase in any of the operating costs and expenses mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. \n\nConsolidation of customers, reduced staffing levels of customers or reduced spending by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services, commodities and automotive industries. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base. \n\n&#8226; Our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial, commodity market and automotive products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial, commodity market and automotive products and services. If a significant portion of our customer base elects to consolidate their spending on financial, commodity market and automotive products and services with other vendors and not us or self-source their product and service needs, or if we lose a large portion of our business to lower priced competitors, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; A material portion of our revenues in our Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index-based funds (including exchange-traded funds) and other index-based investment products. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nIf we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data. \n\n&#8226; Many of our suppliers are also our competitors, and they could change the terms of the data and products that they supply to us in order to gain competitive advantage against us, which could materially harm our business. \n\n&#8226; We utilize certain information and data provided by third-party sources in a variety of ways, including information gathered by market participants and large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world. \n\n&#8226; From time to time, the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all. While such issues have not materially adversely affected us to date, the future occurrence of any such issue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The consolidation of our suppliers could result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce, which can impact the size of our supplier base, or an increase in fees charged by our suppliers, which can increase our operating costs. \n\n&#8226; Some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a significant data provider&#8217;s information could result in a substantial decrease of the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nOur inability to successfully recover should we or our third-party service providers experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. \n\n&#8226; Should we or our third-party service providers experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, civil unrest, protests, military conflict, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attack, outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, security breach, cyber attack, data breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our or our third-party service provider&#8217;s personnel, our or our third-party service provider&#8217;s office facilities and the proper functioning of our or our third-party service provider&#8217;s computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. Global climate change is resulting, and is projected to continue to result, in certain natural disasters and adverse weather, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea&#8208;level rise, flooding, heat waves, and cold waves, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity. In the event or any such disaster or other business continuity problem, we could experience \n\noperational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, or we could be exposed to the operational challenges of our third-party service providers, over which we have no control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\n&#8226; We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. \n\nOutsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in material financial loss, increased costs, regulatory actions and penalties, reputational harm, unauthorized access to our systems, system or network disruption and improper disclosure of confidential information. \n\n&#8226; We have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies, and such functions may be further outsourced. From time to time, our third-party service providers do not perform to our standards, produce reliable results, perform in a timely manner, or perform at all. We also face the risk that our third-party service providers may fail to comply with legal requirements or maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm. \n\n&#8226; Outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data. Failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs. \n\n&#8226; AWS provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a &#8220;cloud&#8221; computing service. Currently, we run a significant amount of our computing on AWS. Given this, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. \n\n&#8226; We rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality, including our AWS &#8220;cloud&#8221; computing services. Our service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber attacks, adverse changes to financial condition, bankruptcy or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Thus, our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to &#8220;the cloud&#8221; or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure. \n\nOur reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace. \n\n&#8226; Our reputation, credibility, and the strength of our brand are key competitive strengths. \n\n&#8226; Given our role in the financial, commodities and automotive markets, our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation, credibility, and brand. \n\n&#8226; We provide credit ratings, pricing and valuation services, benchmark products, and indices, many of which depend on contributions or inputs from third parties or market participants. Our customers and other market participants expect us to be able to demonstrate that our products and services are produced independently and are not readily subject to manipulation. We believe our products and services are designed with appropriate methodologies, processes, and procedures to maintain independence and integrity; however, we may not be able to prevent third parties or market participants from working together or colluding to try to manipulate their inputs and thus the resulting outputs of our products and services. From time to time, we are involved in third-party investigations or litigation related to the markets and stakeholders our products and services serve. Any failures, negative publicity, investigations, or lawsuits that implicate the independence and integrity of our credit ratings, pricing and valuation services, benchmarks, and indices could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these products and services and could harm our reputation and our business. \n\n&#8226; Negative perceptions or publicity, including with respect to our sustainability and corporate responsibility policies and practices, could damage our reputation with customers, prospects, regulators, and the public generally, which could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations. \n\n&#8226; Our divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on economic conditions, including assessing the impact of events that create volatility and economic uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work, the views and assumptions we express, the conclusions we draw, the actions we take (including, but not limited to, rating actions, revising the composition of our indices, etc.), and the work our divisions produce are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight. We have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of \n\nvolatility and economic uncertainty. Such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation, brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries and litigation. \n\n&#8226; Damage to our reputation, credibility, and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nClimate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy pose operational, commercial and regulatory risks. \n\nThe physical commodity and commodity derivative markets may be impacted by decisions by market participants and policy makers to address climate change. In addition, the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy involves changes to consumer and institutional preferences around energy consumption, and the possible failure of our products or services to facilitate the needs of customers during the transition to renewable energy could adversely impact our business and revenues. Changing preferences could also have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of our customers, which could result in reduced revenues from those customers. We are also subject to risks relating to new or heightened climate change-related regulations or legislation, which could impact us and our customers and result in increased regulatory, compliance or operational costs. We are also subject to reputational risks relating to the perception of whether or not we are facilitating a migration away from fossil fuels. The risks associated with climate change and the transition to renewable energy and a net zero economy are continuing to evolve rapidly, and we expect that climate change-related risks may increase over time. \n\nOur expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our business into major geographic and product markets (including the People&#8217;s Republic of China, private equity and sustainability), and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur indebtedness, or a downgrade to our credit ratings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Our indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: making it more difficult for us to satisfy our indebtedness obligations and our other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults&#894; events of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt instruments, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses&#894; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, and the overall economy&#894; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged&#894; and increasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. \n\n&#8226; Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our indebtedness obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, for many reasons, including to fund acquisitions. If we add additional indebtedness or other liabilities, the related risks that we face could intensify. \n\nWe are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to: \n\n&#9702; economic and political conditions around the world, \n\n&#9702; inflation, \n\n&#9702; fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates, \n\n&#9702; limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, \n\n&#9702; differing accounting principles and standards, \n\n&#9702; increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, \n\n&#9702; potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law, \n\n&#9702; changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including data localization requirements, \n\n&#9702; the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls, withdrawal of licenses to operate, and other restrictive governmental actions, \n\n&#9702; competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions, and \n\n&#9702; civil unrest, protests, terrorism, unstable governments, geopolitical uncertainties and legal systems, and other factors. \n\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Additionally, we are subject to complex U.S., European and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws. Our internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs related to these topics are not always effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Violations of such laws could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct that have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n"

Further discussion relating to our ASR agreements can be found in Note 9 - Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nRepurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) provides a narrative of the results of operations and financial condition of S&#38;P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#8220;S&#38;P Global,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The MD&#38;A provides information on factors that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and comparability and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). \n\nThe MD&#38;A includes the following sections: \n\n&#8226; Overview \n\n&#8226; Results of Operations \n\n&#8226; Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#8226; Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information \n\n&#8226; Critical Accounting Estimates \n\n&#8226; Recent Accounting Standards \n\nCertain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward-Looking Statements on p age 4 of this report. \n\nOVERVIEW \n\nWe are a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, automotive and engineering markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals &#38; steel and agriculture; the automotive markets include manufacturers, suppliers, dealerships and service shops; and the engineering markets include engineers, builders, and architects. \n\nDuring 2022, following the completion of our merger with IHS Markit, we reorganized our reportable segments increasing from four reportable segments to six reportable segments consisting of: S&#38;P Global Market Intelligence (&#8220;Market Intelligence&#8221;), S&#38;P Global Ratings (&#8220;Ratings&#8221;), S&#38;P Global Commodity Insights (&#8220;Commodity Insights&#8221;), S&#38;P Global Mobility (&#8220;Mobility&#8221;), S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices (&#8220;Indices&#8221;) and S&#38;P Global Engineering Solutions (&#8220;Engineering Solutions&#8221;). The creation of the two additional segments in 2022 did not materially impact prior years&#8217; reportable segments. \n\n&#8226; Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions. \n\n&#8226; Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. \n\n&#8226; Commodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. \n\n&#8226; Mobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies. \n\n&#8226; Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. \n\n&#8226; Engineering Solutions is a leading provider of engineering standards and related technical knowledge. \n\nOn February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit Ltd (&#8220;IHS Markit&#8221;) by acquiring 100% of the IHS Markit common stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition, and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&#38;P Global, and the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 include the financial results of IHS Markit from the date of acquisition. The merger with IHS Markit, a world leader in critical information, analytics, and solutions for the major industries and markets that drive economies, brings together two world-class organizations with leading brands and capabilities across information services that will be uniquely positioned to serve, facilitate and power the markets of the future. \n\nOn January 14, 2023, we entered into a securities and asset purchase agreement with Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &#38; Co. L.P. (&#8220;KKR&#8221;) to sell our Engineering Solutions business for $975 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We currently anticipate the divestiture to result in after-tax proceeds of approximately $750 million, which proceeds are expected to be used for share repurchases. The agreement follows our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit. The transaction, which is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfying other customary closing conditions, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023. \n\nShareholder Return \n\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2022, we have returned approximately $15.6 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly dividends: we completed share repurchases of approximately $13.2 billion and distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately $2.4 billion. Also, on January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.90 per share. \n\nKey Results \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change 1 \n\n&#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 11,181 $ 8,297 $ 7,442 35% 11% \n\nOperating profit 2 \n\n$ 4,944 $ 4,221 $ 3,617 17% 17% % Operating margin 44 % 51 % 49 % Diluted earnings per share from net income \n\n$ 10.20 $ 12.51 $ 9.66 (18)% 29% ##TABLE_END\n\n1 &#160;% changes in the tables throughout the MD&#38;A are calculated off of the actual number, not the rounded number presented. \n\n2 Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a gain on dispositions of $1.9 billion, IHS Markit merger costs of $619 million, employee severance charges of $289 million, a S&#38;P Foundation grant of $200 million, disposition-related costs of $24 million, a gain on acquisition of $10 million, an asset impairment of $9 million, lease impairments of $5 million, legal costs of $5 million, an asset write-off of $4 million and an acquisition-related benefit of $4 million. 2021 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $249 million, employee severance charges of $19 million, gain on dispositions of $11 million, a lease impairment of $3 million, Kensho retention related expense of $2 million, acquisition-related costs of $4 million and recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2020 includes lease impairments of $120 million, employee severance charges of $66 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $24 million, a gain on dispositions $16 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $12 million, lease-related costs of $11 million and Kensho retention related expense of $11 million. 2022, 2021 and 2020 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $905 million, $96 million and $123 million, respectively. \n\nRevenue increased 35% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit; subscription revenue growth for certain Desktop products, RatingsXpress&#174;, RatingsDirect&#174;, and certain data feed products within Data &#38; Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence; continued demand for market data and market insights products and higher conference revenue at Commodity Insights; higher exchange-traded derivative revenue, higher average levels of assets under management for mutual funds and higher data subscription revenue at Indices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue at Ratings due to lower corporate bond ratings revenue driven by a decrease in high-yield and investment-grade issuance volumes, lower bank loan ratings revenue and a decrease in structured finance revenue. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points. \n\nOperating profit increased 17%. Excluding the favorable impact of a higher gain on dispositions of 57 percentage points, partially offset by the impact of higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 11 percentage points, a S&#38;P Foundation grant in 2022 of 6 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2022 of 26 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2022 of 8 percentage points and disposition-related costs of 1 percentage point, operating profit \n\nincreased 12% . The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, lower incentive costs and lower occupancy costs from reduced real estate footprint, partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit and promotion increases, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions, higher outside services expenses and an increase in technology expenses. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \n\nRevenue increased 11% with an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point from the net impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. Revenue growth at Ratings was driven by an increase in both transaction revenue and non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased due to higher bank loan ratings revenue and structured finance revenue. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance, entity credit ratings, an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and higher Ratings Evaluation Service (&#8220;RES&#8221;) revenue. Revenue growth at Market Intelligence was driven by subscription revenue growth in Market Intelligence Desktop products, Credit Risk Solutions and Data Management Solutions. Revenue growth at Indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for exchange traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;) and mutual funds and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower exchange-traded derivative revenue. The revenue increase at Platts was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \n\nOperating profit increased 17%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Excluding the unfavorable impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2021 of 31 percentage points, partially offset by higher lease impairment charges in 2020 of 16 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 7 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2020 of 4 percentage points and higher technology-related impairment charges in 2020 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 15%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth at all of our reportable segments combined with a decrease in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases. \n\nOur Strategy \n\nWe are a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, automotive and engineering markets. Our purpose is to accelerate progress. We seek to deliver on this purpose in line with our core values of discovery, partnership and integrity. \n\nIn 2018, we announced the launch of Powering the Markets of the Future to provide a framework for our forward-looking business strategy. Through this framework, we seek to deliver an exceptional, differentiated customer experience by enhancing our foundational capabilities, evolving and growing our core businesses, and pursuing growth via adjacencies. In 2023, we are striving to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following key areas: \n\nFinance \n\n&#8226; Meeting or exceeding our organic revenue growth and EBITA margin targets; \n\n&#8226; Realizing our merger/integration commitments - cost and revenue synergy targets; and \n\n&#8226; Driving growth and superior shareholder returns through effective execution, active portfolio management and prudent capital allocation. \n\nCustomer at the Core \n\n&#8226; Enhancing customer support and seamless user experience with a focus on ease of discoverability, distribution, and delivery of our products and services and integrated capabilities; and \n\n&#8226; Continuing to invest in customer facing solutions and processes. \n\nGrow and Innovate \n\n&#8226; Continuing to fund and accelerate key growth areas and transformational adjacencies; \n\n&#8226; Exercising disciplined organic capital allocation, inorganic and partnership strategies; and \n\n&#8226; Growing the value of S&#38;P Global&#8217;s brand through an integrated marketing and communication strategy; driving awareness and consideration across the product offering. \n\nData and Technology \n\n&#8226; Efficient integration, accessibility and governance of enterprise data assets, with initial focus on sustainability data, data science and enterprise-wide data management through the formation of a data council to drive enterprise value creation; \n\n&#8226; Advancing transition to optimize tech spend practice i.e., shifting the balance towards funding higher growth innovation, establishing key spend benchmarks and 3-year transition plan; and \n\n&#8226; Continuing momentum in transitioning all products and services to a cloud-based ecosystem while implementing technologies that align to our customer needs and unlock new opportunities. \n\nLead and Inspire \n\n&#8226; Continuing to improve diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention, while continuing to raise awareness through Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion education; and \n\n&#8226; Ensuring our people are engaged with a particular focus on learning, development and career opportunities, and continue to embed our purpose and values throughout the Company. \n\nExecute and Deliver \n\n&#8226; Driving continuous commitment to risk management, compliance, and control across S&#38;P Global; and \n\n&#8226; Creating a more sustainable impact. \n\nThere can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nFurther projections and discussion on our 2023 outlook for our segments can be found within &#8220; &#8211; Results of Operations&#8221;. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nConsolidated Review \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 11,181 $ 8,297 $ 7,442 35% 11% Expenses: Operating-related expenses 3,766 2,195 2,094 72% 5% Selling and general expenses 3,383 1,714 1,541 97% 11% Depreciation and amortization 1,013 178 206 N/M (13)% Total expenses 8,162 4,087 3,841 N/M 6% Gain on dispositions (1,898) (11) (16) N/M (30)% Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries (27) &#8212; &#8212; N/M N/M Operating profit 4,944 4,221 3,617 17% 17% Other income, net (70) (62) (31) (14)% (96)% Interest expense, net 304 119 141 N/M (16)% Loss on extinguishment of debt 8 &#8212; 279 N/M N/M Provision for taxes on income 1,180 901 694 31% 30% Net income 3,522 3,263 2,534 8% 29% Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n(274) (239) (195) (15)% (22)% Net income attributable to S&#38;P Global Inc. \n\n$ 3,248 $ 3,024 $ 2,339 7% 29% ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\nRevenue \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 11,181 $ 8,297 $ 7,442 35% 11% Subscription revenue 6,201 3,255 3,037 90% 7% Non-subscription / transaction revenue 1,807 2,320 2,030 (22)% 14% Non-transaction revenue 1,640 1,698 1,500 (3)% 13% Asset-linked fees 862 800 648 8% 23% Sales usage-based royalties 286 224 227 28% (1)% Recurring variable 385 &#8212; &#8212; N/M N/M % of total revenue: Subscription revenue 55 % 39 % 41 % Non-subscription / transaction revenue 16 % 28 % 27 % Non-transaction revenue 15 % 20 % 20 % Asset-linked fees 8 % 10 % 9 % Sales usage-based royalties 3 % 3 % 3 % Recurring variable 3 % &#8212; % &#8212; % U.S. revenue $ 6,653 $ 5,012 $ 4,504 33% 11% International revenue: European region 2,597 1,995 1,769 30% 13% Asia 1,246 874 782 43% 12% Rest of the world 685 416 387 65% 7% Total international revenue $ 4,528 $ 3,285 $ 2,938 38% 12% % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 60 % 60 % 61 % International revenue 40 % 40 % 39 % ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M - Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\n2022 \n\nRevenue increased 35% as compared to 2021. Subscription revenue increased primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth in Desktop products, Credit &#38; Risk Solutions and Data &#38; Advisory Solutions at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products and higher data subscription revenue at Indices also contributed to the increase. Non-subscription / transaction revenue decreased due to a decrease in corporate bond ratings revenue, bank loan ratings revenue and structured finance revenue at Ratings, partially offset by the impact of the merger with IHS Markit and an increase in conference revenue at Commodity Insights. Non-transaction revenue decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, a decrease in entity credit ratings revenue and lower RES revenue, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and an increase in surveillance revenue at Ratings. Asset linked fees increased primarily due to higher average levels of assets under management for mutual funds at Indices. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was primarily driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence represents revenue from contracts for services that specify a fee based on, among other factors, the number of trades processed, assets under management, or the number of positions valued. See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below for further information. \n\nThe unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. \n\nRevenue increased 11% as compared to 2020. Subscription revenue increased primarily from growth in Market Intelligence's average contract values and continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products. Higher data subscription revenue at Indices also contributed to subscription revenue growth. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased due to an increase in bank loan ratings revenue and higher structured finance revenue at Ratings. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance, entity credit ratings, an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and higher RES revenue at Ratings. Asset linked fees increased reflecting higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds at Indices. The decrease in sales usage-based royalties was primarily driven by lower exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices. See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below for further information. \n\nThe favorable impact of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. \n\nTotal Expenses \n\nThe following tables provide an analysis by segment of our operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 % Change Operating- related expenses Selling and general expenses Operating- related expenses Selling and general expenses Operating- related expenses Selling and general expenses Market Intelligence 1 \n\n$ 1,677 $ 983 $ 922 $ 499 82% 97% \n\nRatings 2 \n\n940 392 995 433 (5)% (9)% \n\nCommodity Insights 3 \n\n513 466 214 242 N/M 93% \n\nMobility 4 \n\n296 385 &#8212; &#8212; N/M N/M \n\nIndices 5 \n\n207 218 173 168 20% 30% \n\nEngineering Solutions 6 \n\n197 76 &#8212; &#8212; N/M N/M Intersegment eliminations 7 \n\n(169) &#8212; (146) &#8212; (16)% N/M Total segments \n\n3,661 2,520 2,158 1,342 70% 88% Corporate Unallocated expense 8 \n\n105 863 37 372 N/M N/M $ 3,766 $ 3,383 $ 2,195 $ 1,714 72% 97% ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M - Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\n1 In 2022, selling and general expenses include employee severance charges of $90 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million and acquisition-related costs of $2 million.

The increase was primarily due to revenue growth primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, lower incentive costs and lower occupancy costs from reduced real estate footprint, partially offset by a decrease in revenue at Ratings, expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit and promotion increases, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions and an increase in technology expenses. See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below for further information. \n\nCorporate Unallocated Expense &#8212; Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses.

Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries was $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nForeign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities.

Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency. \n\nSegment Operating Profit &#8212; Increased $711 million or 18% as compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 2 percentage points and higher lease-related costs of 1 percentage point in 2020, segment operating profit increased 15%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue at all of our reportable segments combined with a decrease in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases. See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below for further information. \n\nCorporate Unallocated Expense&#8212; Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2021 of 45 percentage points, higher lease-related costs in 2021 of 1 percentage point and higher acquisition-related costs in 2021 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher lease impairments in 2020 of 23 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles in 2020 of 4 percentage points, higher Kensho retention related expense in 2020 of 2 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point, Corporate Unallocated expense increased 16% primarily due to higher incentive costs. \n\nForeign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency. \n\nOther Income, net \n\nOther income, net primarily includes the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans. Other income, net for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $70 million , $62 million, $31 million respectively . During 2022 and 2020, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.K. pension plan, triggering the recognition of a non-cash pre-tax settlement charges of $13 million and $3 million, respectively. Excluding these pre-tax settlement charges, other income, net was $83 million , $62 million , and $34 million for 2022, 2021, 2020, respectively. The increase in other income, net in 2022 compared to 2021 and in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a higher gain on investments. \n\nInterest Expense, net \n\nNet interest expense for 2022 increased $185 million compared to 2021 primarily due to higher debt balances. Net interest expense for 2021 decreased $22 million or 16% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the refinancing of a series of our senior notes in August of 2020. See Note 4 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net \n\nIn 2022, we recognized an $8 million loss on extinguishment of debt which includes a tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer of $142 million, partially offset by a $134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt. 2020 includes $279 million related to the redemption fee on the early retirement of our 4.4% senior notes due in 2026 and a portion of the 6.55% senior notes due in 2037 and 4.5% senior notes due in 2048 in the third quarter of 2020. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate was 25.1%, 21.6% and 21.5% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the tax charge on merger related divestitures. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to a change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. \n\nSegment Review \n\nMarket Intelligence \n\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.

This alliance integrated Market Intelligence's proprietary data into Q4's portfolio of solutions, enabling further opportunities for commercial collaboration. In connection with transitioning its IR webhosting business to Q4, Market Intelligence received a minority investment in Q4. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $11 million ($6 million after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of IR. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3 million ($3 million after-tax) and $1 million ($1 million after-tax), respectively, in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of Standard &#38; Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC (&#8220;SPIAS&#8221;), a business within our Market Intelligence segment, that occurred in July of 2019. \n\nSee Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion including information on the merger with IHS Markit. \n\nMarket Intelligence includes the following business lines: \n\n&#8226; Desktop &#8212; a product suite that provides data, analytics and third-party research for global finance and corporate \n\nprofessionals, which includes the Capital IQ platforms (which are inclusive of S&#38;P Capital IQ Pro, Capital IQ, Office and Mobile products); \n\n&#8226; Data &#38; Advisory Solutions &#8212; a broad range of research, reference data, market data, derived analytics and valuation services covering both the public and private capital markets, delivered through flexible feed-based or API delivery mechanisms. This also includes issuer solutions for public companies, a range of products for the maritime &#38; trade market, data and insight into Financial Institutions, the telecoms, technology and media space as well as ESG and supply chain data analytics; \n\n&#8226; Enterprise Solutions &#8212; software and workflow solutions that help our customers manage and analyze data; identify risk; reduce costs; and meet global regulatory requirements. The portfolio includes industry leading financial technology solutions like Wall Street Office, Enterprise Data Manager, Information Mosaic, and iLevel. Our Global Markets Group offering delivers bookbuilding platforms across multiple assets including municipal bonds, equities and fixed income; and \n\n&#8226; Credit &#38; Risk Solutions &#8212; commercial arm that sells Ratings' credit ratings and related data and research, advanced analytics, and financial risk solutions which includes subscription-based offerings, RatingsXpress&#174;, RatingsDirect&#174; and Credit Analytics. \n\nSubscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, valuation services, analytics, third party research, and credit ratings-related information through both feed and web-based channels. Subscription revenue also includes software and hosted product offerings which provide maintenance and continuous access to our platforms over the contract term. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence represents revenue from contracts for services that specify a fee based on, among other factors, the number of trades processed, assets under management, or the number of positions valued. Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing conferences and events, and analytical services. \n\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 3,811 $ 2,185 $ 2,046 74 % 7 % Subscription revenue $ 3,263 $ 2,131 $ 1,991 53 % 7 % Recurring variable revenue $ 385 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M \n\nNon-subscription revenue \n\n$ 163 $ 54 $ 54 N/M (2) % Asset-linked fees $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 1 N/M (94) % % of total revenue: Subscription revenue 86 % 98 % 97 % Recurring variable revenue 10 % &#8212; % &#8212; % Non-subscription revenue 4 % 2 % 3 % Asset-linked fees &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % U.S. revenue $ 2,231 $ 1,374 $ 1,316 62 % 4 % International revenue $ 1,580 $ 811 $ 730 95 % 11 % % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 59 % 63 % 64 % International revenue 41 % 37 % 36 % \n\nOperating profit 1 \n\n$ 2,488 $ 676 $ 569 N/M 19 % % Operating margin 65 % 31 % 28 % ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M &#8211; Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\nNote &#8211; In the first quarter of 2022, the Market Intelligence Commodities business was transferred to th e Commodity Insights segment and prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current presentation. \n\n1 2022 includes a gain on dispositions of $1.8 billion, employee severance charges of $90 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $35 million, and acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2021 includes employee severance charges of $3 million, a gain on disposition of $3 million, \n\nacquisition-related costs of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $27 million, a gain on dispositions of $12 million and lease-related costs of $3 million. 2022, 2021 and 2020 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $474 million, $65 millio n and $76 million, respectively. \n\nRevenue increased 74% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Subscription revenue growth for certain Market Intelligence Desktop products, RatingsXpress&#174;, RatingsDirect&#174;, and certain data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points. \n\nOperating profit increased 268%. Excluding the impact of a gain on dispositions of 282 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles of 63 percentage points, employee severance charges in 2022 of 13 percentage points and IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 5 percentage points, operating profit increased 67% primarily due to revenue growth and lower incentive costs, partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, an increase in technology expenses and higher compensation costs. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 4 percentage points. \n\nRevenue increased 7% driven by subscription revenue growth for RatingsXpress&#174;, RatingsDirect&#174;, certain Market Intelligence Desktop products, and certain data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions. Both U.S. revenue and international revenue increased compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \n\nOperating profit increased 19%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact from higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 6 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles in 2020 of 3 percentage points, partially offset by the impact of a higher gain on the dispositions in 2020 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 12%. The impact of revenue growth and lower compensation costs due to reduced headcount was partially offset by an increase in cost of sales and intersegment royalties tied to annualized contract value growth, increased technology costs and higher incentive costs. \n\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \n\nMarket Intelligence continues to focus on developing key product offerings in growth areas such a Environmental, Social and Governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) and growing new products and product features by leveraging technology investments. Product launches and innovation continued at Market Intelligence in 2022 with the introduction of several new ESG related products and new products and product features leveraging technology investments. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment \n\nThe market for data, analytical capabilities and research services is intensely competitive, ranging from established firms to market disruptors. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally based on a number of factors, including the quality and range of its data, analytical capabilities, research services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, and technological innovation. \n\nMarket Intelligence is subject to global regulation, particularly in the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S. Several laws and regulations in the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S. have been adopted but not yet implemented, or have been proposed or are being considered, to which Market Intelligence, or its clients, will or may become subject, including laws and regulations related to pricing providers, sustainability, credit rating data, data privacy and cyber security. For example, the EU passed the Digital Operational Resilience Act in December 2022 (&#8220;DORA&#8221;), which is expected to take effect by the end of January 2025. DORA will impose operational resilience and cyber security standards and obligations, including technical and organizational standards and responsibilities which may require technology and/or organizational investment, upon (i) many Market Intelligence financial market clients, who may look to pass such obligations onto vendors like Market Intelligence, and (ii) information and communications technology providers designated by the EU as &#8220;Critical Third Party Providers,&#8221; which may, or may not, include Market Intelligence. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has announced that it will conduct a market study into how competition is working in the markets for credit rating data and market data generally, which is expected to commence at the start of 2023. \n\nAt this time, the impact on Market Intelligence of any such recently adopted or proposed laws or regulations, or market studies, remains uncertain, but they could increase the regulatory exposure of Market Intelligence or the costs and legal risks relating to Market Intelligence&#8217;s activities, adversely affect the ability of Market Intelligence to provide its products and services, or result \n\nin changes in the demand for its products and services. If Market Intelligence fails to comply with any such laws or regulations, it could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines. Regulatory developments may also present commercial opportunities to Market Intelligence to develop further or different services to enable better compliance by its clients. \n\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Market Intelligence business, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nRatings \n\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default. \n\nRatings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with: \n\n&#8226; ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and \n\n&#8226; bank loan ratings. \n\nNon-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $143 million, $1 36 million an d $128 million, respectively. \n\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 3,050 $ 4,097 $ 3,606 (26) % 14 % Transaction revenue $ 1,241 $ 2,253 $ 1,969 (45) % 14 % Non-transaction revenue $ 1,809 $ 1,844 $ 1,637 (2) % 13 % % of total revenue: Transaction revenue 41 % 55 % 55 % Non-transaction revenue 59 % 45 % 45 % U.S. revenue $ 1,652 $ 2,398 $ 2,110 (31) % 14 % International revenue $ 1,398 $ 1,699 $ 1,496 (18) % 14 % % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 54 % 59 % 59 % International revenue 46 % 41 % 41 % \n\nOperating profit 1 \n\n$ 1,672 $ 2,629 $ 2,223 (36) % 18 % % Operating margin 55 % 64 % 62 % ##TABLE_END\n\n1 2022 includes employee severance charges of $24 million, legal costs of $5 million and an asset write-off of $1 million. 2021 includes a gain on disposition of $6 million, recovery of lease-related costs of $4 million, and employee severance charges of $3 million. 2020 includes a technology-related impairment charge of $11 million, lease-related costs of $5 million and employee severance charges of $4 million. 2022, 2021 and 2020 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $7 million, $10 million and $7 million, respectively. \n\n2022 \n\nRevenue decreased 26% with an unfav orable impact from foreign exchange rates of 3 percentage points. Transaction revenue decreased due to lower corporate bond ratings revenue driven by a decrease in high-yield and investment-grade issuance volumes and lower bank loan ratings revenue. A decrease in structured finance revenues primarily driven by decreased issuance of U.S. collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;) also contributed to the decrease in transaction revenue. Reduced issuance volumes mainly resulted from unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in 2022 compared to strong issuance levels in the prior year period. Non-transaction revenue decreased 2% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, a decrease in entity credit ratings revenue and lower Ratings Evaluation Service ( &#8220;RES&#8221;) revenue driven by decreased M&#38;A activity, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and an increase in surveillance revenue. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 3 percentage points, non-transaction revenue increased 1%. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. \n\nOperating profit decreased 36%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2022 of 1 percentage point, operating profit decreased 35% primarily due to a decline in revenue partially offset by decrease in expenses. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower incentive costs due to weaker financial performance, lower outside services expenses, lower occupancy costs from reduced real estate footprint, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by targeted investments into key areas of the business, and the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions. \n\nRevenue increased 14%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to higher bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased M&#38;A activity and an increase in structured finance revenue primarily driven by increased issuance of U.S. CLOs. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance, entity credit ratings, an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and higher RES revenue driven by increased M&#38;A activity. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. \n\nOperating profit increased 18%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. The impact of revenue growth and lower occupancy costs was partially offset by an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs due to annual merit increases, additional headcount and human capital investments, as well as the ramp up of technology and strategic initiatives. \n\nMarket Issuance Volumes \n\nWe monitor market issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located. Structured Finance issuance includes amounts when a transaction closes, not when initially priced, and excludes domestically-rated Chinese issuance. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on data from SDC Platinum for Corporate bond issuance and based on a composite of external data feeds and Ratings' internal estimates for Structured Finance issuance. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 Compared to 2021 Corporate Bond Issuance * U.S. Europe Global High-yield issuance (79)% (70)% (77)% Investment-grade issuance (20)% (12)% (18)% Total issuance** (39)% (28)% (24)% ##TABLE_END\n\n* Includes Industrials and Financial Services. \n\n** Includes rated and non-rated issuance. \n\n&#8226; Corporate issuance was down in the U.S. and Europe reflecting unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in 2022 compared to strong issuance levels in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 Compared to 2021 Structured Finance U.S. Europe Global Asset-backed securities (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) (11)% (43)% (13)% Structured credit (primarily CLOs) (68)% (70)% (68)% Commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) (5)% (86)% (11)% Residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;) (29)% 25% (21)% Covered bonds ** 68% 72% Total issuance (38)% (1)% (23)% ##TABLE_END\n\n** Represents no activity in 2022 or 2021. \n\n&#8226; ABS issuance decreased in the U.S. and Europe driven by a decline in Autos, Student Loans, and Non-Traditional / Esoterics. \n\n&#8226; CLO issuance was down in the U.S. and European structured credit markets due to unfavorable market conditions and widening spreads slowing down new issues and eliminating refinancing and resets. \n\n&#8226; CMBS issuance was down in the U.S. reflecting unfavorable market conditions. CMBS issuance was also down in Europe, although from a low 2021 base. \n\n&#8226; RMBS issuance was down in the U.S. reflecting decreased market volume due to unfavorable market conditions. RMBS issuance increased in Europe reflecting an increase in large jumbo deals. \n\n&#8226; Covered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in Europe increased from a low 2021 base as cheaper government programs slowed down. \n\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \n\nRevenue decreased in 2022 primarily driven by declines in corporate bond ratings revenue, bank loan ratings revenue, structured finance transaction revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary. CRISIL revenue increased across all segments, primarily driven by Global Research &#38; Risk Solutions. In 2022, Ratings continued to focus on developing key product offerings in ESG and launched new sustainability products. ESG initiatives and international expansion in China continue to be areas of focus for Ratings. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment \n\nGeneral \n\nRatings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company&#8217;s operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings or to increase competition among credit rating agencies, and regarding remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings&#8217; rating activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings. \n\nIn the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into Ratings&#8217; compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations \n\nor inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. \n\nU.S. \n\nThe businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the &#8220;Reform Act&#8221;), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd Frank Act&#8221;), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S. \n\nS&#38;P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (&#8220;NRSRO&#8221;). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC&#8217;s Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&#38;P Global Ratings&#8217; Form NRSRO are available on S&#38;P Global Ratings&#8217; website. \n\nEuropean Union \n\nIn the European Union (\"EU\"), the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation (&#8220;CRA1&#8221;) that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the EU, which became effective in 2010. CRA1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the EU established the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#8220;ESMA&#8221;), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the EU. \n\nAdditional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things: \n\n&#8226; impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers; \n\n&#8226; require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations; \n\n&#8226; impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer; \n\n&#8226; impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and \n\n&#8226; impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services. \n\nThe financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the EU. \n\nOther Jurisdictions \n\nOutside of the U.S. and the EU, regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. This includes the UK, which has established a credit rating agencies oversight regime similar to that in place in the EU, and where Ratings was granted registration with the Financial Conduct Authority on January 1, 2021. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future. \n\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Ratings business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commodity Insights provides essential price data, analytics, industry insights and software &#38; services, enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency. \n\nCommodity Insights includes the following business lines: \n\n&#8226; Energy &#38; Resources Data &#38; Insights &#8212; includes data, news, insights, and analytics for petroleum, gas, power &#38; renewables, petrochemicals, metals &#38; steel, agriculture, and other commodities; \n\n&#8226; Price Assessments &#8212; includes price assessments and benchmarks, and forward curves; \n\n&#8226; Upstream Data &#38; Insights &#8212; includes exploration &#38; production data and insights, software and analytics; and \n\n&#8226; Advisory &#38; Transactional Services &#8212; includes consulting services, conferences, events and global trading services. \n\nCommodity Insights' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources: \n\n&#8226; Subscription revenue &#8212; primarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses; \n\n&#8226; Sales usage-based royalties &#8212; primarily from licensing our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and \n\n&#8226; Non-subscription revenue &#8212; conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses. \n\nSee Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion including information on the merger with IHS Markit. \n\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 1,685 $ 1,012 $ 938 66 % 8 % Subscription revenue $ 1,492 $ 933 $ 869 60 % 7 % Sales usage-based royalties $ 67 $ 66 $ 62 2 % 7 % \n\nNon-subscription revenue \n\n$ 126 $ 13 $ 7 N/M N/M % of total revenue: Subscription revenue 89 % 92 % 93 % Sales usage-based royalties 4 % 7 % 6 % Non-subscription revenue 7 % 1 % 1 % U.S. revenue $ 673 $ 356 $ 322 89 % 11 % International revenue $ 1,012 $ 656 $ 616 54 % 6 % % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 40 % 35 % 34 % International revenue 60 % 65 % 66 % \n\nOperating profit 1 \n\n$ 591 $ 544 $ 478 9 % 14 % % Operating margin 35 % 54 % 51 % ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\nNote &#8211; In the first quarter of 2022, the Market Intelligence Commodities business was transferred to the Commodity Insights segment and prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current presentation. \n\n1 2022 include s employee severance charges of $45 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $26 million. 2021 inc ludes recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $11 million and lease-related costs of $2 million. 2022, 2021, and 2020 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $111 million, $8 million, and $9 million, respectively. \n\nRevenue increased 66% primarily due to the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and higher conference revenue driven by the return of in-person attendance at Commodity Insights conferences in 2022 compared to virtual events in 2021. The Energy &#38; Resources Data &#38; Insights, Price Assessments and Upstream Data &#38; Insights businesses continue to be the most significant revenue drivers, followed by the Advisory &#38; Transactional Services business, which contributed large growth in the first quarter of 2022. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point. \n\nOperating profit increased 9%. Excluding the impact of higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 19 percentage points, employee severance charges in 2022 of 8 percentage points and IHS Markit merger costs in 2022 of 5 percentage points, operating profit increased 41%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by expenses associated with the merger with IHS Markit, an increase in costs related to the Commodity Insights conferences in 2022, higher compensation costs, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions and an increase in operating costs to support business initiatives at Commodity Insights. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point. \n\nRevenue increased 8% primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes in Petroleum and LNG also contributed to revenue growth. Both U.S. revenue and international revenue grew compared to 2021. \n\nOperating profit increased 14% with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 3 percentage points and higher lease-related costs in 2020 of 1%, operating profit increased 10%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support business initiatives at Commodity Insights and an increase in incentive costs. \n\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \n\nIn 2022, the impact of the merger with IHS Markit, sustained demand for market data and market insights products, new and enhanced products &#38; services, and higher conference revenue driven by the return of in-person attendance at Commodity Insights conferences in 2022 compared to virtual events in 2021 contributed to revenue growth. Commodity Insights continues to focus on developing new products and product features leveraging technology investments and developing key product offerings in ESG, including energy transition. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment \n\nCommodity Insights' price assessment business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny. As discussed below under the heading &#8220;Indices-Legal and Regulatory Environment&#8221;, the benchmarks industry is subject to the new regulation in the EU (the &#8220;EU Benchmark Regulation&#8221;) as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions. Commodity Insights has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets in the Netherlands under the EU Benchmark Regulation, and it will likely need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom when the transitional period under the EU Benchmark Regulation (and its UK equivalent) ends, as well as in jurisdictions outside of Europe if they pass similar legislation. \n\nThe EU has enacted MiFID II, which revise and update the existing EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the substantive provisions became applicable in all EU Member States as of January 3, 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm&#8217;s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). MiFID II and potential subsequent amendments may result in changes to the manner in which the Commodity Insights business licenses its price assessments. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (\"MAR\") may impose additional regulatory burdens on Commodity Insights activities in the EU over time, but they have not yet resulted in increased substantive impact or costs. \n\nIn October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Commodity Insights has aligned its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks. \n\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Commodity Insights business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Mobility operates globally, with staff located in over 17 countries. \n\nMobility's revenue is generated primarily through the following sources: \n\n&#8226; Subscription revenue &#8212; Mobility's core information products provide critical information and insights to all global OEMs, most of the world&#8217;s leading suppliers, and the majority of North American dealerships. Mobility operates across both the new and used car markets. Mobility provides data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supplies car makers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and supports dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention solutions. Mobility also sells a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities; and \n\n&#8226; Non-subscription revenue &#8212; One-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature &#8211; and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as OEM marketing spend or safety recall activity &#8211; as well as consulting and advisory services. \n\nThe Mobility business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and financial results are included since the date of acquisition. \n\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 1,142 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M Subscription revenue $ 888 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M \n\nNon-subscription revenue \n\n$ 254 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M % of total revenue: Subscription revenue 78 % &#8212; % &#8212; % Non-subscription revenue 22 % &#8212; % &#8212; % U.S. revenue $ 932 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M International revenue $ 210 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 82 % &#8212; % &#8212; % International revenue 18 % &#8212; % &#8212; % \n\nOperating profit 1 \n\n$ 213 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M % Operating margin 19 % &#8212; % &#8212; % ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\n1 2022 includes an acquisition-related benefit of $14 million, employee severance charges of $4 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $3 million. 2022 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $241 million. \n\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \n\nIn 2022, Mobility&#8217;s revenue was underpinned by strong and broad-based performance across its businesses. Specifically, we saw strong new business growth and high retention rates. Mobility continued to focus on multiple growth opportunities including: evolving our forecasting business to encompass new technologies and new forms of mobility; supporting the industry in its transformation to hybrid and digital retail; enabling consumers to shop, buy, service and sell used cars; and, leveraging the power of S&#38;P Global to develop products for financial markets and to facilitate the industry&#8217;s transition towards sustainable mobility. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment \n\nCertain types of information that our Mobility business collects, compiles, stores, uses, transfers, publishes and/or sells is subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates. There is an increasing public concern regarding, and resulting regulations of, privacy, data, and consumer protection issues. Laws and regulations to which our Mobility business is subject pertain primarily to personally identifiable information relating to individuals. Such laws and regulations constrain the collection, use, storage, and transfer of personally identifiable information, and impose other obligations with which we must comply. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation and civil or criminal penalties (including monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines) in one or more jurisdictions and reputational damage resulting in the loss of data, brand equity and business. To conduct our operations, our Mobility business also moves data across national borders and consequently can be subject to a variety of evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security in an increasing number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;), the cyber-security law adopted by China in 2017, and the 2020 California Privacy Act, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which our Mobility business operates, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. It is possible that our Mobility business could be prohibited or constrained from collecting or disseminating certain types of data or from providing certain products or services. If our Mobility business fails to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. For example, a failure to comply with the GDPR could result in fines up to the greater of &#8364;20 million or 4% of annual global revenues. Additional risks are presented by the evolving landscape related to sanctions and export control laws. The landscape related to these laws is evolving rapidly and presents compliance challenges to all businesses covered by these laws. \n\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Mobility business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Mobility business, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nIndices \n\nIndices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. Indices&#8217; mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products, and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $52 million ($43 million after-tax) for the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nIndices derives revenue from asset-linked fees when investors direct funds into its proprietary designed or owned indexes, sales usage-based royalties of its indices, as well as data subscription arrangements. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources: \n\n&#8226; Investment vehicles &#8212; asset-linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds; \n\n&#8226; Exchange traded derivatives &#8212; generate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges; \n\n&#8226; Index-related licensing fees &#8212; fixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and \n\n&#8226; Data and customized index subscription fees &#8212; fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research. \n\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 1,339 $ 1,149 $ 989 17% 16% Asset-linked fees $ 862 $ 800 $ 647 8% 24% Subscription revenue $ 258 $ 191 $ 177 35% 7% Sales usage-based royalties $ 219 $ 158 $ 165 38% (4)% % of total revenue: Asset-linked fees 65 % 69 % 65 % Subscription revenue 19 % 17 % 18 % Sales usage-based royalties 16 % 14 % 17 % U.S. revenue $ 1,088 $ 959 $ 826 14% 16% International revenue $ 251 $ 190 $ 163 30% 17% % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 81 % 83 % 84 % International revenue 19 % 17 % 16 % \n\nOperating profit 1 \n\n$ 927 $ 798 $ 666 16% 20% Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests \n\n$ 249 $ 215 $ 181 16% 19% Net operating profit $ 678 $ 583 $ 485 16% 20% % Operating margin 69 % 70 % 67 % % Net operating margin 51 % 51 % 49 % ##TABLE_END\n\n1 2022 includes a gain on disposition of $52 million, employee severance charges of $14 million and IHS Markit merger costs of $2 million. 2021 i ncludes recovery of lease-related costs of $1 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a lease impairment charge of $4 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2022 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $31 million and 2021 and 2020 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million. \n\nRevenue at Indices increased 17% primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by higher average trading volume from increased volatility, higher average levels of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) for mutual funds, higher data subscription revenue and the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Ending AUM for ETFs in 2022 was $2.601 trillion. Excluding AUM related to the merger with IHS Markit, ending AUM for ETFs decreased 12% to $2.466 trillion and average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 5% to $2.526 trillion compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \n\nOperating profit increased 16%. Excluding the impact of a gain on disposition of 7 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 4 percentage points and employee severance charges in 2022 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 15%. The impact of revenue growth and lower incentive costs were partially offset by an increase in outside services expenses, strategic investments, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, higher data costs, the resumption of business travel from the lifting of COVID restrictions and the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point. \n\n2021 \n\nRevenue at Indices increased 16% primarily due to higher average levels of AUM for ETFs and mutual funds and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower exchange-traded derivative revenue. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 44% to $2.419 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 40% to $2.796 trillion compared to 2020 while exchange-traded derivative activity was impacted by both lower average daily trading volume from reduced volatility and lower rates per trade from a shift in product mix in the first half of 2021. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \n\nOperating profit increased 20%. Excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point, a lease impairment charge in 2020 of 1 percentage point and higher lease-related costs in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 17%. The impact of revenue growth and lower legal related costs was partially offset by higher cost of sales, higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. \n\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \n\nRevenue increased in 2022 primarily due to higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by higher average trading volume from increased volatility, higher average levels of AUM for mutual funds, higher data subscription revenue and the impact of the merger with IHS Markit. Indices continues to be a leading index provider for the ETF market space. In 2022, Indices continued to launch new Sustainability ETFs and expand innovative index offerings with index product launches in high growth areas such as factor and thematic indices and multi-asset-class indices. Indices continues to focus on developing new indices and product features leveraging investments in technology and research and development, as well as close collaboration with its customers. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment \n\nThe financial benchmarks industry is subject to specific benchmark regulation in the European Union (the \"EU Benchmark Regulation\"), the United Kingdom (the \"UK Benchmark Regulation\"), and Australia (the \"Australia Benchmark Regulation\"). Various other jurisdictions, including the United States, are also considering the regulation of financial benchmarks through new or existing regimes. \n\nAlthough they vary in scope, the requirements of the EU Benchmark Regulation, the UK Benchmark Regulation and the Australian Benchmark Regulation are similar. Indices currently maintains a benchmark administrator in both the Netherlands (authorized by the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (AFM)) for its benchmark activities in the European Union and in the United Kingdom (authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority) for its benchmark activities in the United Kingdom. The EU Benchmark Regulation and the UK Benchmark Regulation have and may continue to cause operating obligations, increased compliance risk and additional costs for Indices. The Australian Benchmark Regulation requires a license from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (&#8220;ASIC&#8221;), which Indices has obtained. The Australian Benchmark Regulation has and may continue to cause increased compliance risk and additional costs for Indices. \n\nIn July of 2013, the IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (the &#8220;Financial Benchmark Principles&#8221;), intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmarks. The Financial Benchmark Principles address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles. \n\nThe markets for index providers are very competitive. Indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its indices, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation. Indices also faces challenges from various disrupters and attempts to circumvent its licensing regime. Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels or notional values of investment products based on our indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor&#8217;s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product. \n\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Indices business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Engineering Solutions includes our Product Design offerings that provide technical professionals with the information and insight required to more effectively design products, optimize engineering projects and outcomes, solve technical problems and address complex supply chain issues. Our offerings utilize advanced knowledge discovery technologies, research tools, and software-based engineering decision engines to advance innovation, maximize productivity, improve quality and reduce risk. \n\nEngineering Solutions' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources: \n\n&#8226; Subscription revenue &#8212; primarily from subscriptions to our Product Design offerings providing standards, codes and specifications; applied technical reference; engineering journals, reports, best practices, and other vetted technical reference; and patents and patent applications, which includes Engineering Workbench; Goldfire's cognitive search and other advanced knowledge discovery capabilities that help pinpoint answers buried in enterprise systems and unstructured data enabling engineers and technical professionals to accelerate problem solving; and \n\n&#8226; Non-subscription revenue &#8212; primarily from retail transaction and consulting services. \n\nThe Engineering Solutions business was acquired in connection with the merger with IHS Markit on February 28, 2022 and financial results are included since the date of acquisition. \n\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Revenue $ 323 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M Subscription revenue $ 300 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M \n\nNon-subscription revenue \n\n$ 23 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M % of total revenue: Subscription revenue 93 % &#8212; % &#8212; % Non-subscription revenue 7 % &#8212; % &#8212; % U.S. revenue $ 179 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M International revenue $ 144 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M % of total revenue: U.S. revenue 55 % &#8212; % &#8212; % International revenue 45 % &#8212; % &#8212; % \n\nOperating profit 1 \n\n$ 15 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; N/M N/M % Operating margin 5 % &#8212; % &#8212; % ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\n1 2022 includes employee severance charges of $4 million and amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $35 million. \n\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook \n\nOn January 14, 2023, we entered into a securities and asset purchase agreement with Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &#38; Co. L.P. (&#8220;KKR&#8221;) to sell our Engineering Solutions business for $975 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We currently anticipate the divestiture to result in after-tax proceeds of approximately $750 million, which proceeds are expected to be used for share repurchases. The agreement follows our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit. The transaction, which is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfying other customary closing conditions, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment \n\nThe legal and regulatory environment for our Engineering Solutions business is similar to our Mobility Business. See &#8220;Mobility-Legal and Regulatory Environment&#8221; above for additional details about the legal and regulatory environment for our Engineering Solutions business. \n\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Engineering Solutions business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Engineering Solutions business, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nWe continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In 2023, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs in the short term and into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure. \n\nCash Flow Overview \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $5.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 2,603 $ 3,598 $ 3,567 Investing activities 3,628 (120) (240) Financing activities (11,326) (1,013) (2,166) ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022 free cash flow decreased to $2.2 billion compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See &#8220;Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow. \n\nOperating activities \n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased to $2.6 billion compared to 2021. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in operating results, an increase in IHS Markit merger costs, higher taxes paid on divestitures and a grant payment to the S&#38;P Global Foundation in 2022. \n\nCash provided by operating activities remained unchanged at $3.6 billion as compared to 2020 as higher operating results in 2021 were offset by the acceleration of payments to vendors, higher incentive compensation payments and higher income tax payments. \n\nInvesting activities \n\nOur cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions. \n\nCash provided for investing activities was $3.6 billion for 2022 as compared to cash used for investing activities of $0.1 billion in 2021, primarily due to cash received from the dispositions of CUSIP Global Services, Oil Price Information Services, the Leveraged Commentary and Data business and a related family of leveraged loan indices, and the Base Chemicals business in 2022. \n\nCash used for investing activities decreased to $0.1 billion for 2021 as compared to $0.2 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 for the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM and Greenwich Associates LLC. \n\nRefer to Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. \n\nFinancing activities \n\nOur cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. \n\nCash used for financing activities increased to $11.3 billion in 2022 from $1.0 billion in 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2022. \n\nCash used for financing activities decreased to $1.0 billion in 2021 from $2.2 billion in 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2021. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased a total of 33.5 million shares for $12.0 billion of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not use cash to purchase any shares. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased a total of 4.0 million shares for $1,161 million of cash. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased shares for $3 million, which settled in the first quarter of 2020, resulting in $1,164 million of cash used to repurchase shares. See Note 9 &#8212; Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our accelerated share repurchase (&#8220;ASR&#8221;) agreements. \n\nOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the &#8220;2022 Repurchase Program&#8221;), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the &#8220;2020 Repurchase Program&#8221;), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 50 million shares (the &#8220;2013 Repurchase Program&#8221;), which was approximately 18% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. As of December 31, 2022, 27.2 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 and 2013 repurchase programs were completed. \n\nAdditional Financing \n\nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our &#8220;credit facility&#8221;) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. On April 26, 2021, we entered into a revolving $1.5 billion five-year credit agreement that included an accordion feature which allowed the Company to increase the total commitments thereunder by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain customary terms and conditions. On February 25, 2022, we exercised the accordion feature which increased the total commitments available under our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022 there was $188 million of commercial paper outstanding. \n\nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually.

This summarized financial information excludes the Non-Obligor Group. Intercompany balances and transactions between members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. This information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\nSummarized results of operations for the year ended December 31 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 Revenue $ 2,752 Operating Profit 1,496 Net Income 1,227 Net income attributable to S&#38;P Global Inc. 1,227 ##TABLE_END\n\nSummarized balance sheet information as of December 31 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 Current assets (excluding intercompany from Non-Obligor Group) $ 699 $ 6,124 Noncurrent assets 1,410 846 Current liabilities (excluding intercompany to Non-Obligor Group) 1,046 1,307 Noncurrent liabilities 11,172 5,242 Intercompany payables to Non-Obligor Group 11,926 4,851 ##TABLE_END\n\nContractual Obligations \n\nWe typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. \n\nWe believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for 2023. \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2022, over the next several years. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the footnotes to the table: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Total \n\nDebt: 1 \n\nPrincipal payments $ 226 $ 52 $ 1,736 $ 8,942 $ 10,956 Interest payments 339 679 640 3,305 4,963 \n\nOperating leases 2 \n\n138 216 170 261 785 \n\nPurchase obligations and other 3 \n\n398 388 106 5 897 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,101 $ 1,335 $ 2,652 $ 12,513 $ 17,601 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Our debt obligations are described in Note 5 &#8211; Debt to our consolidated financial statement. \n\n2 See Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations . \n\n3 Other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $223 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have recorded $3,267 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 &#8211; Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (\"CGIS\") has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make. \n\nWe make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During 2022, we contributed $11 million to our retirement plans. Expected employer contributions in 2023 are $10 million and $3 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2023, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 &#8211; Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION \n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. \n\nWe believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock. \n\nThe presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, % Change &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Cash provided by operating activities $ 2,603 $ 3,598 $ 3,567 (28)% 1% Capital expenditures (89) (35) (76) Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders (270) (227) (194) Free cash flow $ 2,244 $ 3,336 $ 3,297 (33)% 1% ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 &#8217;22 vs &#8217;21 &#8217;21 vs &#8217;20 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities 3,628 (120) (240) N/M (50)% Cash used for financing activities (11,326) (1,013) (2,166) N/M (53)% ##TABLE_END\n\nN/M &#8211; Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \n\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. \n\nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&#38;A. \n\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: \n\nRevenue recognition \n\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 1 - Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nBusiness combinations \n\nWe apply the purchase method of accounting to our business combinations. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration are allocated based on their estimated fair values. Fair value determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions about several highly subjective variables, including future cash flows, discount rates, and expected business performance. There are also different valuation models and inputs for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions may be based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. Depending on the size of the purchase price of a particular acquisition, the mix of intangible assets acquired, and expected business performance, the purchase price allocation could be materially impacted by applying a different set of assumptions and estimates. \n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts \n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $25 million. \n\nWe incorporate the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process. In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2023. \n\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets) \n\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management&#8217;s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $35.4 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. \n\nGoodwill \n\nAs part of our annual impairment test of our six reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a quantitative impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For 2022, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units&#8217; fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts. \n\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations. \n\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nRetirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits \n\nOur employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits. \n\nThe following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits: \n\n&#8226; Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds. \n\n&#8226; The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan&#8217;s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. \n\nOur discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Retirement Plans Postretirement Plans January 1 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.63 % 3.05 % 2.75 % 5.52 % 2.72 % 2.20 % Return on assets 6.00 % 4.00 % 5.00 % ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.1 billion in pension benefit obligation for our U.S. retirement plans. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an estimated decrease or increase to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $30 million and an increase or decrease in 2023 pension expense of approximately $1 million. An increase or decrease of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $14 million to 2023 pension expense. \n\nStock-based compensation \n\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively. \n\nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. \n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2023. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $10.1 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $4.1 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our f oreign operations. \n\nContingencies \n\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred. \n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest \n\nThe fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $3.3 billion in redeemable noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ultimate amount paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business could be significantly different because the redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the business. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the weighted average cost of capital used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 11%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease or increase the redemption value by approximately $81 million. As of December 31, 2022, the terminal growth rate used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 2.2%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the redemption value by approximately $27 million. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nSee Note 1 &#8211; Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods. \n\n"

We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

This arrangement is reported as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at fair value of $3,267 million at December 31, 2022. The Company adjusts the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. \n\nAuditing the Company's valuation of its redeemable noncontrolling interest was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value. The estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the business. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., revenue growth rates and operating margins), a company specific beta and earnings and transaction multiples for comparable companies and similar acquisitions, respectively. These significant judgmental assumptions that incorporate market data are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s controls over the accounting for its redeemable noncontrolling interest, including controls over management's judgments and evaluation of the underlying assumptions with regard to the valuation models applied and the estimation process supporting the determination of the fair value of S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture. \n\nTo test the valuation of redeemable noncontrolling interest, we evaluated the Company's selection of the valuation methodology and the methods and significant assumptions used by inspecting available market data and performing sensitivity analyses. For example, when evaluating the assumptions related to the revenue growth rate and operating profit margins, we compared the assumptions to the past performance of S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture in addition to current observable industry, market and economic trends. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodology and significant assumptions used by the Company, including the discount rate, company specific beta and earnings for comparable companies and transaction multiples for similar acquisitions. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START IHS Markit Business Combination Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 28, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of IHS Markit Ltd., for aggregate consideration of $43.5 billion. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of IHS Markit Ltd. was complex due to the significant estimation in the Company's determination of fair value of identified intangible assets of $18.6 billion, which principally consisted of customer relationships, trademark/tradenames, developed technology, and databases (collectively referred to as the identified intangibles). The significant estimation was primarily due to the sensitivity of the fair value of underlying assumptions about future performance of the acquired business in the Company's discounted cash flow models used to measure the identified intangibles. These significant assumptions included the revenue and expense growth rates that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested the Company's controls that address the risk of material misstatement relating to the Company's accounting for the acquisition. For example, we tested controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of the identified intangibles, which included testing controls over management's review of assumptions used in its respective valuation models to test the estimated fair value of the identified intangibles. We performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions used by the Company's valuation specialist, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the estimated fair value. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodologies used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates, including testing the revenue and expense growth rates that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate. For example, we compared these significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, to assumptions used to value similar assets in other acquisitions, to the historical results of the acquired business, and to the Company's budgets and forecasts, in addition to performing sensitivity analyses over these assumptions. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company's disclosures included in Note 2 in relation to these acquisition matters. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ ERNST &#38; YOUNG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1969. \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 9, 2023 \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of S&#38;P Global Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited S&#38;P Global Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, S&#38;P Global Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ ERNST &#38;

Subscription revenue at Commodity Insights is primarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products and software term licenses. Subscription revenue at Mobility is primarily derived from products that provide data and insight on future vehicles sales and production, including detailed forecasts on technology and vehicle components; supply car makers and dealers with market reporting products, predictive analytics and marketing automation software; and support dealers with vehicle history reports, used car listings and service retention solutions. Subscription revenue at Mobility also include a range of services to financial institutions, to support their marketing, insurance underwriting and claims management activities. Subscription revenue at Indices is derived from the contracts for underlying data of our indexes to support our customers' management of index funds, portfolio analytics, and research. Subscription revenue at Engineering Solutions is primarily from subscriptions to our Product Design offerings providing standards, codes and specifications; applied technical reference; engineering journals, reports, best practices, and other vetted technical reference; and patents and patent applications. \n\nFor subscription products and services, we generally provide continuous access to dynamic data sets and analytics for a defined period, with revenue recognized ratably as our performance obligation to provide access to our data and analytics is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract. \n\nNon-transaction revenue \n\nNon-transaction revenue at Ratings primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment revenue elimination of $ 169 million, $ 146 million and $ 137 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively, mainly consisting of the royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. \n\nFor non-transaction revenue related to Rating&#8217;s surveillance services, we continuously monitor factors that impact the creditworthiness of an issuer over the contractual term with revenue recognized to the extent that our performance obligation is progressively fulfilled over the term contract. Because surveillance services are continuously provided throughout the term of the contract, our measure of progress towards fulfillment of our obligation to monitor a rating is a time-based output measure with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract. \n\nNon-subscription / Transaction revenue \n\nTransaction revenue at our Ratings segment primarily includes fees associated with: \n\n&#8226; ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments; as well as structured finance instruments; and \n\n&#8226; bank loan ratings. \n\nTransaction revenue is recognized at the point in time when our performance obligation is satisfied by issuing a rating on our customer's instruments and when we have a right to payment and the customer can benefit from the significant risks and rewards of ownership. \n\nNon-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing conferences and events, and analytical services. Non-subscription revenue at Mobility include one-time transactional sales of data that are non-cyclical in nature &#8212; and that are usually tied to underlying business metrics such as vehicle manufacturers marketing spend or safety recall activity &#8212; as well as consulting and advisory services. Non-subscription revenue at Commodity Insights is primarily related to conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, events, and perpetual software licenses. Non-subscription revenue at Engineering Solutions is primarily from retail transaction and consulting services. \n\nAsset-linked fees \n\nAsset-linked fees at Indices are primarily related to royalties payments based on the value of assets under management in our customers exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. \n\nFor asset-linked products and services, we provide licenses conveying continuous access to our index and benchmark-related intellectual property during a specified contract term. Revenue is recognized when the extent that our customers have used our licensed intellectual property can be quantified. Recognition of revenue for our asset-linked fee arrangements is subject to the \"recognition constraint\" for usage-based royalty payments because we cannot reasonably predict the value of the assets that will be invested in index funds structured using our intellectual property until it is either publicly available or when we are notified by our customers. Revenue derived from an asset-linked fee arrangement is measured and recognized when the certainty of the extent of its utilization of our index products by our customers is known. \n\nSales usage-based royalties \n\nSales usage-based royalty revenue at our Indices segment is primarily related to trading based fees from exchange-traded derivatives. Sales and usage-based royalty revenue at our Commodity Insights segment is primarily related to licensing of its proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges. \n\nFor sales usage-based royalty products and services, we provide licenses conveying the right to continuous access to our intellectual property over the contract term, with revenue recognized when the extent of our license&#8217;s utilization can be quantified, or more specifically, when trading volumes are known and publicly available to us or when we are notified by our customers. Recognition of revenue of fees tied to trading volumes is subject to the recognition constraint for a usage-based \n\nroyalty promised by our customers in exchange for the license of our intellectual property, with revenue recognized when trading volumes are known. \n\nRecurring variable revenue \n\nRecurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence represents revenue from contracts for services that specify a fee based on, among other factors, the number of trades processed, assets under management, or the number of positions valued. \n\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations \n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one performance obligation is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. The fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services&#8217; stand-alone selling price and record revenue as it is earned over the service period. \n\nReceivables \n\nWe record a receivable when a customer is billed or when revenue is recognized prior to billing a customer. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual period. \n\nContract Assets \n\nContract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, contract assets were $ 60 million and $ 9 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nUnearned Revenue \n\nWe record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $ 1.5 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period. \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations \n\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $ 4.2 billion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately half and three-quarters of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter. \n\nWe do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. \n\nCosts to Obtain a Contract \n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 175 million and $ 137 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately 5 years. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses. \n\nEquity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries \n\nThe Company holds an investment in a 50 / 50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combined each of the company&#8217;s post-trade services into a new joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME Group&#8217;s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company&#8217;s MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company&#8217;s \n\nbusiness to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. \n\nOther Income, net \n\nThe components of other income, net for the years ended December 31 are as follows: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Other components of net periodic benefit cost $ ( 11 ) $ ( 45 ) $ ( 32 ) Net (gain) loss from investments ( 59 ) ( 17 ) 1 &#160; Other income, net $ ( 70 ) $ ( 62 ) $ ( 31 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations \n\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale \n\nWe classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal group; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. \n\nA disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. \n\nThe fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale in the current period in our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nIn determining whether a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be presented as a discontinued operation, we make a determination whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. If we conclude that the disposal represents a strategic shift, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nPrinciples of consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \n\nUse of estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nCash and cash equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and were $ 1.3 billion and $ 6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These investments are not subject to significant market risk. \n\nRestricted cash \n\nCash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheets was $ 1 million and $ 8 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nShort-term investments \n\nShort-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit and mutual funds, are carried at fair value, which is estimated based on the net asset value of these investments. Interest and dividends are recorded in income when earned. \n\nAccounts receivable \n\nCredit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer&#8217;s financial condition. Accounts receivable, which include billings consistent with terms of contractual arrangements, are recorded at net realizable value. \n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts \n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. \n\nCapitalized technology costs \n\nWe capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-of-pocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life, three to seven years , using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization. Gross capitalized technology costs were $ 259 million and $ 216 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized technology costs was $ 190 million and $ 173 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFair Value \n\nCertain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value and classified within a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used when measuring fair value. We have foreign exchange forward contracts, cross currency and interest rate swaps that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis. \n\nOther financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments. The fair value of our long-term debt borrowings were $ 9.3 billion and $ 4.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices. \n\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets) \n\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management&#8217;s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. \n\nLeases \n\nWe determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement. We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 14 years, and some of which include options to terminate the \n\nleases within 1 year. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of use (\"ROU\") assets and associated lease liabilities. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices. \n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses. \n\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. \n\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have six reporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment. \n\nWe initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a quantitative impairment test. \n\nWhen conducting our impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted free cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) analyses and are corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. \n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \n\nSignificant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations. \n\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nForeign currency translation \n\nWe have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the United States (\"U.S.\") dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period \n\nexchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity. \n\nDepreciation \n\nThe costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from 15 to 40 years and equipment and furniture from 2 to 10 years. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases. \n\nAdvertising expense \n\nThe cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. We incurred $ 177 million, $ 39 million and $ 29 million in advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nStock-based compensation \n\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nIncome taxes \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively. \n\nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. \n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2023. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have a pproximately $ 10.1 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $ 4.1 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations. \n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest \n\nThe agreement with the minority partners of our S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by our minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption &#8220;Redeemable noncontrolling interest.&#8221; If the interest were to be redeemed, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. See Note 9 &#8211; Equity for further detail. \n\nContingencies \n\nWe accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, \n\nas well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record our best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred. \n\nRecent Accounting Standards \n\nIn March of 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued accounting guidance to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current contract modifications and hedge accounting guidance in light of the expected market transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) to alternative rates. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The transactions primarily include (1) contract modifications, (2) hedging relationships, and (3) sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. In December of 2022, the FASB amended its guidance to defer the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company may elect to adopt the amendments prospectively to transactions existing as of or entered into from the date of adoption through December 31, 2024. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nReclassification \n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability purposes. \n\n2. Acquisitions and Divestitures \n\nAcquisitions \n\nOn January 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of ChartIQ, a premier charting provider for the financial services industry. ChartIQ is a professional grade charting solution that allows users to visualize data with a fully interactive web-based library that works seamlessly across web, mobile and desktop. It provides advanced capabilities including trade visualization, options analytics, technical analysis and more. Additionally, ChartIQ allows clients to visualize vendor-supplied data combined with their own proprietary content, alternative datasets or analytics. The acquisition will be part of our Market Intelligence segment and further enhance our S&#38;P Capital IQ Pro platform, our digital investment solutions provider Markit Digital and other workflow solutions to provide the industry with leading visualization capabilities. The acquisition of ChartIQ is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOn January 4, 2023, we completed the acquisition of TruSight Solutions LLC (&#8220;TruSight&#8221;) a provider of third-party vendor risk assessments. The acquisition will be integrated into our Market Intelligence segment and further expand the breadth and depth of S&#38;P Global&#8217;s third party vendor risk management solutions by offering high-quality validated assessment data to clients designed to reduce further the vendor due diligence burden on service providers to the financial services industry. The acquisition of TruSight is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Shades of Green business from the Center for International Climate Research (&#8220;CICERO&#8221;), Norway's foremost institute for interdisciplinary climate research. The acquisition will be integrated into S&#38;P Global Ratings and further expand the breadth and depth of its second party opinions (SPOs) offering. SPOs are independent assessments of a company's financing or framework's alignment with market standards and typically provided before any borrowing is raised. The acquisition of the Shades of Green business is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nMerger with IHS Markit \n\nOn February 28, 2022, we completed the merger with IHS Markit by acquiring 100 % of the IHS Markit common stock that was issued and outstanding as of the date of acquisition, and as a result, IHS Markit and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of S&#38;P Global. \n\nUpon completion of the merger with IHS Markit, IHS Markit stockholders received 113.8 million shares of S&#38;P Global&#8217;s \n\ncommon stock, at an exchange ratio of 0.2838 S&#38;P Global shares for each share of IHS Markit common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The Company also issued approximately 0.9 million replacement equity award shares for IHS Markit equity awards that were assumed pursuant to the merger agreement. \n\nThe estimated fair value of the consideration transferred for IHS Markit was approximately $ 43.5 billion as of the merger date, which consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except for share and per share data) February 28, 2022 Number of shares IHS Markit issued and outstanding* 400,988,207 &#160; Exchange ratio 0.2838 Number of S&#38;P Global common stock transferred to IHS Markit stockholders 113,800,453 &#160; Closing price per share of S&#38;P Global common stock** $ 380.89 &#160; Fair value of S&#38;P Global common stock transferred IHS Markit stockholders $ 43,345 &#160; Fair value of S&#38;P Global replacement equity awards attributable to pre-combination service $ 191 &#160; Total equity consideration $ 43,536 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n*Excludes 25,219,470 IHS Markit shares held by the Markit Group Holdings Limited Employee Benefit Trust ( &#8220; EBT &#8221; ). The shares held by the EBT were converted in the merger into S&#38;P Global shares at the exchange ratio of 0.2838 and will continue to be held by the trustee in the EBT. \n\n**Based on S&#38;P Global's closing stock price on February 25, 2022. \n\nPreliminary Allocation of Purchase Price \n\nThe merger with IHS Markit was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;). The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, of which $ 699 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to synergies from future expected economic benefits, including enhanced revenue growth from expanded capabilities and geographic presence as well as substantial cost savings from duplicative overhead, streamlined operations and enhanced operational efficiency. The December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet includes the assets and liabilities of IHS Markit, which have been measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. The preliminary allocation of purchase price recorded for IHS Markit is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) February 28, 2022 Assets acquired Cash and cash equivalents $ 310 &#160; Accounts receivable, net 968 &#160; Prepaid and other current assets 224 &#160; Assets of businesses held for sale 1,519 &#160; Property and equipment 118 &#160; Right of use assets 240 &#160; Goodwill 31,451 &#160; Other intangible assets 18,620 &#160; Equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 1,644 &#160; Other non-current assets 54 &#160; Total assets acquired $ 55,148 &#160; Liabilities assumed Accounts payable $ 174 &#160; Accrued compensation 90 &#160; Short-term debt 968 &#160; Unearned revenue 1,053 &#160; Other current liabilities 579 &#160; Liabilities of businesses held for sale 72 &#160; Long-term debt 4,191 &#160; Lease liabilities - non-current 231 &#160; Deferred tax liability - non-current 4,198 &#160; Other non-current liabilities 56 &#160; Total liabilities assumed $ 11,612 &#160; Total consideration transferred $ 43,536 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe above fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are based on the information that was available as of the reporting date. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the identifiable assets acquired, have been preliminarily determined using the income and cost approaches, and are partially based on inputs that are unobservable. For intangible assets, these inputs include forecasted future cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates that require judgement and are subject to change. Differences between the preliminary estimates and final accounting could occur, and those differences could be material. \n\nThe Company believes that the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, but the potential for additional measurement period adjustments exists based on the Company&#8217;s continuing review of matters related to the acquisition. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets acquired, deferred taxes and residual goodwill. The Company will complete the purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nAcquired Identifiable Intangible Assets \n\nThe following table sets forth preliminary estimated fair values of the components of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Fair Value Weighted Average Useful Lives Customer relationships $ 13,596 &#160; 25 years Trade names and trademarks 1,469 &#160; 14 years Developed technology 1,043 &#160; 10 years Databases 2,512 &#160; 12 years Total Identified Intangible Assets $ 18,620 &#160; 21 years ##TABLE_END \n\nAcquisition-Related Expenses \n\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related c osts of $ 619 million related to the IHS Markit merger for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 249 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. These costs were included in selling and general expe nses within the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022 , and December 31, 2021 , respectively. \n\nPro forma information \n\nSince the acquisition date, the results of operations for IHS Markit of $ 3.799 billion of revenue and $ 659 million of operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been included within the accompanying consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma combined financial information presents the Company&#8217;s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 as if the acquisition of IHS Markit had occurred on January 1, 2021. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company&#8217;s operating results that may have actually occurred had the acquisition of IHS Markit been completed on January 1, 2021.

We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition of The Climate Service, Inc. is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nFor acquisitions during 2021 that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized on our acquisitions is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible \n\nassets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are being amortized over their anticipated use ful lives between 3 and 5 years. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid cash for acquisitions of $ 201 million, net of cash acquired, funded with cash from operations.

The acquisition complemented CRISIL's existing portfolio of products and expanded offerings to new segments across financial services including commercial banks and asset and wealth managers. We accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition of Greenwich is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#8226; In January of 2020, we completed the acquisition of the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM, which includes the widely followed SAM* Corporate Sustainability Assessment, an annual evaluation of companies' sustainability practices. The acquisition bolstered our position as the premier resource for ESG insights and product solutions for our customers. Through this acquisition, we are able to offer our customers even more transparent, robust and comprehensive ESG solutions. We accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition of the ESG Ratings Business is not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nFor acquisitions during 2020 that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized on our acquisitions is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are being amortized over their anticipated useful lives between 3 and 10 years. The goodwill for Greenwich and ESG Ratings Business is deductible for tax purposes. \n\nNon-cash investing activities \n\nLiabilities assumed in conjunction with our acquisitions are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Fair value of assets acquired $ 54,944 &#160; $ 110 &#160; $ 219 &#160; Equity transferred ( 43,536 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Cash acquired (paid), net 210 &#160; ( 99 ) ( 201 ) Liabilities assumed $ 11,618 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 18 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDivestitures \n\nOn January 14, 2023, we entered into a securities and asset purchase agreement with Allium Buyer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &#38; Co. L.P. (&#8220;KKR&#8221;) to sell our Engineering Solutions business for $ 975 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We currently anticipate the divestiture to result in after-tax proceeds of approximately $ 750 million, which proceeds are expected to be used for share repurchases. The agreement follows our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business. Engineering Solutions became part of the Company following our merger with IHS Markit. The transaction, which is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfying other customary closing conditions, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023. \n\nAs a condition of securing regulatory approval for the merger, S&#38;P Global and IHS Markit agreed to divest of certain of their businesses.

The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to a change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. \n\nWe have elected to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred. GILTI expense is included in Other, net above. \n\nThe principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Employee compensation $ 100 &#160; $ 57 &#160; Accrued expenses 179 &#160; 54 &#160; Postretirement benefits 27 &#160; 28 &#160; Unearned revenue 67 &#160; 74 &#160; Forward exchange contracts &#8212; &#160; 71 &#160; Fixed Assets 49 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Loss carryforwards 537 &#160; 204 &#160; Lease liabilities 170 &#160; 142 &#160; Other 126 &#160; 32 &#160; Total deferred tax assets 1,255 &#160; 662 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Goodwill and intangible assets ( 4,791 ) ( 394 ) Right of use asset ( 100 ) ( 101 ) Postretirement benefits ( 33 ) ( 46 ) Forward exchange contracts ( 41 ) &#8212; &#160; Fixed assets &#8212; &#160; ( 6 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 4,965 ) ( 547 ) Net deferred income tax asset before valuation allowance ( 3,710 ) 115 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 274 ) ( 206 ) Net deferred income tax liability $ ( 3,984 ) $ ( 91 ) Reported as: Non-current deferred tax assets $ 81 &#160; $ 56 &#160; Non-current deferred tax liabilities ( 4,065 ) ( 147 ) Net deferred income tax liability $ ( 3,984 ) $ ( 91 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nWe record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized based upon all the available evidence. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $ 10.1 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $ 4.1 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations. We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable. \n\nWe made net income tax payments tot aling $ 1,555 million in 2022, $ 883 million in 2021, and $ 683 million in 2020. As of December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 1,301 million , of which a significant portion has an unlimited carryover period under current law. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 147 &#160; $ 121 &#160; $ 124 &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 28 &#160; 35 &#160; 24 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 62 &#160; 9 &#160; 1 &#160; Reduction for tax positions of prior years &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 13 ) Reduction for settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 8 ) ( 4 ) Expiration of applicable statutes of limitations ( 14 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) Balance at end of year $ 223 &#160; $ 147 &#160; $ 121 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 223 million , $ 147 million and $ 121 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the change in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a net increase of tax expense of $ 52 million . \n\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the balance sheet may be reduced by up to approximately $ 20 million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations and expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, we had accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits of $ 38 million and $ 24 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe U.S. federal income tax audits for 2018 through 2022 are in process. During 2022, we completed state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2014. Th e impact to tax expense in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was not material. \n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2023. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. \n\n5.

In the transaction, we assumed IHS Markit's publicly traded debt, with an outstanding principal balance of $ 4.6 billion, which was recorded at fair value of $ 4.9 billion on the acquisition date. Debt assumed consisted of the following: \n\n&#8226; 5.00 % Senior Notes due November 1, 2022 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 748 million. \n\n&#8226; 4.125 % Senior Notes due August 1, 2023 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 500 million. \n\n&#8226; 3.625 % Senior Notes due May 1, 2024 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 400 million. \n\n&#8226; 4.75 % Senior Notes due February 15, 2025 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 800 million. \n\n&#8226; 4.00 % Senior Notes due March 1, 2026 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 500 million. \n\n&#8226; 4.75 % Senior Notes due August 1, 2028 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 750 million. \n\n&#8226; 4.25 % Senior Notes due May 1, 2029 with an outstanding principal balance of $ 950 million. \n\nThe adjustment to fair value of the Senior Notes of approximately $ 292 million on the acquisition date will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining contractual terms of the Senior Notes. \n\nOn March 2, 2022, we completed the offer (the &#8220;Exchange Offer&#8221;) to exchange outstanding notes issued by IHS Markit for new notes issued by us and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Standard &#38; Poor's Financial Services LLC with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as each corresponding series of exchange IHS Markit notes and cash. Of the approximately $ 4.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of IHS Markit's Senior Notes offered in the exchange, 96 %, or approximately $ 4.5 billion, were tendered and accepted. The portion not exchanged, approximately $ 175 million, remains outstanding across seven series of Senior Notes issued by IHS Markit. The Exchange Offer was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized fair value adjustment of the IHS Markit Senior Notes allocated to the new debt issued by S&#38;P Global on the settlement date of the exchange. See Note 2 &#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information on the merger. \n\nOn March 18, 2022, we issued $ 1,250 million of 2.45 % Senior Notes due 2027, $ 1,250 million of 2.7 % Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2029, $ 1,500 million of 2.9 % Senior Notes due 2032, $ 1,000 million of 3.7 % Senior Notes due 2052, and $ 500 million of 3.9 % Senior Notes due 2062. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard &#38; Poor's Financial Services LLC. In the first quarter of 2022, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the new debt issuance to fund the redemption and extinguishment of the outstanding principal amount of our 4.125 % Senior Notes due 2023, 3.625 % Senior Notes due 2024, and our 4.0 % Senior Notes due 2026 which were former IHS Markit Notes that were exchanged to SPGI Notes as part of the Exchange Offer. In addition, we also used part of the net proceeds from the new debt issuance noted above to fund the early tender as well as a subsequent full redemption of our 5.0 % Senior Notes due 2022 and the 4.750 % Senior Notes due 2025, both of which were former IHS Markit Notes that were exchanged to SPGI Notes \n\nas part of the Exchange Offer, as well as our 4.0 % Senior Notes due 2025. The majority of these transactions settled within the first quarter of 2022, however, given the timing of certain redemptions, a lesser portion of these settled in the second quarter of 2022, including the redemption and extinguishment of the $ 287 million outstanding principal amount on our 4.0 % senior notes due in 2025, and a portion of the outstanding principal amounts of our 5.0 % senior notes due in 2022 and our 4.75 % senior notes due in 2025, of approximately $ 52 million and $ 247 million, respectively. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an $ 8 million loss on extinguishment of debt. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $ 142 million tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer, partially offset by a $ 134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt. \n\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $ 600 million of 1.25 % senior notes due in 2030 and $ 700 million of 2.3 % senior notes due in 2060. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard &#38; Poor's Financial Services LLC. In the third quarter of 2020, we used the net proceeds to fund the redemption and extinguishment of the $ 900 million outstanding principal amount of our 4.4 % senior notes due in 2026 and a portion of the outstanding principal amount of our 6.55 % senior notes due in 2037 and our 4.5 % senior notes due in 2048. \n\nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $ 2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $ 2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our &#8220;credit facility&#8221;) that will terminate on April 26, 2026. On April 26, 2021, we entered into a revolving $ 1.5 billion five-year credit agreement that included an accordion feature which allowed the Company to increase the total commitments thereunder by up to an additional $ 500 million, subject to certain customary terms and conditions. On February 25, 2022, we exercised the accordion feature which increased the total commitments available under our credit facility from $ 1.5 billion to $ 2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022 there was $ 188 million of commercial paper outstanding. \n\nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility. \n\nThe only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded. \n\n6. Derivative Instruments \n\nOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. \n\nUndesignated Derivative Instruments \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $ 1.8 billion and $ 376 million, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets was $ 5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amount recorded in other current liabilities was $ 37 million as of December 31, 2022 and less than $ 1 million as of December 31, 2021. The \n\namount recorded in selling and general expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 related to these contracts was a net loss $ 45 million and a net gain of $ 9 million, respectively. \n\nNet Investment Hedges \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we entered into cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2024, 2029 and 2030. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $ 1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The changes in the fair value of swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest expense of $ 31 million and net interest income of $ 20 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the fourth quarter of 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within twenty-four months . The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we estimate that $ 1 million of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $ 529 million and $ 498 million, respectively. \n\nInterest Rate Swaps \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps. These contracts are intended to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing and are scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and will be subsequently reclassified into interest expense, net in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $ 1.4 billion and $ 2.3 billion. \n\nThe following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, December 31, Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges: Prepaid and other current assets Foreign exchange forward contracts $ 3 &#160; $ 7 &#160; Other current liabilities Foreign exchange forward contracts $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other non-current assets Interest rate swap contracts $ 145 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other non-current liabilities Interest rate swap contracts $ &#8212; &#160; $ 270 &#160; Derivative designated as net investment hedges: Other non-current assets Cross currency swap $ 84 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other non-current liabilities Cross currency swaps $ &#8212; &#160; $ 17 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Gain (Loss) recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (effective portion) Location of Gain (Loss) reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income (effective portion) Gain (Loss) reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income (effective portion) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Cash flow hedges - designated as hedging instruments \n\nForeign exchange forward contracts $ ( 8 ) $ ( 11 ) $ 17 &#160; Revenue, Selling and general expenses $ ( 6 ) $ 19 &#160; $ 2 &#160; Interest rate swap contracts $ 333 &#160; $ ( 270 ) $ &#8212; &#160; Interest expense, net $ ( 4 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Net investment hedges- designated as hedging instruments Cross currency swaps $ 98 &#160; $ 84 &#160; $ ( 97 ) Interest expense, net $ ( 4 ) $ ( 5 ) $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash Flow Hedges Foreign exchange forward contracts Net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net of taxes, beginning of period $ 6 &#160; $ 14 &#160; $ 2 &#160; Change in fair value, net of tax ( 11 ) 11 &#160; 14 &#160; Reclassification into earnings, net of tax 5 &#160; ( 19 ) ( 2 ) Net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net of taxes, end of period $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 14 &#160; Interest rate swap contracts Net unrealized losses on cash flow hedges, net of taxes, beginning of period $ ( 203 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Change in fair value, net of tax 247 &#160; ( 203 ) &#8212; &#160; Reclassification into earnings, net of tax 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, net of taxes, end of period $ 48 &#160; $ ( 203 ) $ &#8212; &#160; Net Investment Hedges Net unrealized losses on net investment hedges, net of taxes, beginning of period $ ( 17 ) $ ( 81 ) $ ( 8 ) Change in fair value, net of tax 69 &#160; 59 &#160; ( 73 ) Reclassification into earnings, net of tax 4 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net unrealized gains (losses) on net investment hedges, net of taxes, end of period $ 56 &#160; $ ( 17 ) $ ( 81 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n7. Employee Benefits \n\nWe maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued. \n\nWe also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts. \n\nWe also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active and retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans. \n\nWe recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. \n\nNet periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other income, net in our consolidated statements of income. \n\nBenefit Obligation \n\nA summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets): &#160;

The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as &#8220;Medicare Part D&#8221;, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Our benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a subsidy. Effective January 1, 2021, we elected to no longer file for Medicare Part D subsidy. \n\nExpected employer contributions in 2023 are $ 10 million and $ 3 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively.

Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\n&#8226; Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \n\n&#8226; Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. \n\nThe fair value of our defined benefit plans assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset class is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2022 &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and short-term investments $ 5 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equities: U.S. indexes 1 \n\n6 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income: Long duration strategy 2 \n\n1,007 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,007 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Intermediate duration securities 38 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 38 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Real Estate: U.K. 3 \n\n34 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 34 &#160; Infrastructure: U.K. 4 \n\n81 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 81 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total $ 1,171 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 1,126 &#160; $ 34 &#160; Common collective trust funds measured at net asset value as a practical expedient: Collective investment funds 5 \n\n$ 293 &#160; Total $ 1,464 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2021 &#160; Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Cash and short-term investments $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equities: U.S. indexes 1 \n\n6 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income: Long duration strategy 2 \n\n1,376 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,376 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Intermediate duration securities 59 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 59 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Real Estate: U.K. 3 \n\n44 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 44 &#160; Infrastructure: U.K. 4 \n\n81 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 81 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total $ 1,572 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 1,516 &#160; $ 44 &#160; Common collective trust funds measured at net asset value as a practical expedient: Collective investment funds 5 \n\n$ 659 &#160; Total $ 2,231 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Includes securities that are tracked in the S&#38;P Smallcap 600 index. \n\n2 Includes securities that are mainly investment grade obligations of issuers in the U.S. \n\n3 Includes a fund which holds real estate properties in the U.K. \n\n4 Includes funds that invest in global infrastructure for the UK Pension. \n\n5 Includes the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index, the Standard &#38; Poor's MidCap 400 Composite Stock Index, a short-term investment fund which is a common collective trust vehicle, and other various asset classes. \n\nFor securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/custodian determines fair value by applying securities&#8217; prices obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&#38;P 500 commingled trust index fund. \n\nThe trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3. The following table details further information on our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Level 3 \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 \n\n$ 44 &#160; Distributions ( 2 ) Gain (loss) ( 8 ) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 \n\n$ 34 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nPension Trusts&#8217; Asset Allocations \n\nThere are two pension trusts, one in the U.S. and one in the U.K. \n\n&#8226; The U.S. pension trust had assets of $ 1,185 million and $ 1,600 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, and the target allocations in 2022 include 90 % fixed income, 5 % domestic equities, 3 % international equities and 2 % cash and cash equivalents. The year-on-year decline in U.S. pension trust assets is primarily attributable to lower valuations on the plan's U.S. long duration fixed income securities largely driven by increases to the U.S. Central Bank's interest rates. \n\n&#8226; The U.K. pension trust had assets of $ 279 million and $ 631 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the target allocations in 2022 include 39 % fixed income, 29 % infrastructure, 14 % equities, 13 % real estate and 5 % diversified growth funds. The year-over-year reduction in U.K. plan assets is primarily driven by lower valuation of the investment portfolio including a mix of fixed income and growth assets driven by higher interest rates and challenging U.K. economic environment for growth assets. \n\nThe pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth, income and a liability hedge. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the long-term performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns, preserve capital and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions and economic sectors. The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration securities, opportunistic fixed income securities and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and government-agency securities, uninvested cash, receivables and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage. \n\nU.S. Defined Contribution Plan \n\nAssets of the defined contribution plan in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options, which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, target date funds, S&#38;P Global Inc. common stock, stable value and money market strategies. There is also a self-directed mutual fund investment option. The plan purchased 67,248 shares and sold 60,473 shares of S&#38;P Global Inc. common stock in 2022 and purchased 107,651 shares and sold 160,415 shares of S&#38;P Global Inc. common stock in 2021. The plan held approximately 1.2 million shares of S&#38;P Global Inc. common stock as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with market values of $ 402 million and $ 567 million, respectively. The plan received dividends on S&#38;P Global Inc. common stock of $ 4.0 million and $ 3.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\n8. Stock-Based Compensation \n\nWe issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. No further awards may be granted under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2002 Plan&#8221;), although awards granted under the 2002 Plan prior to the adoption of the new 2019 Plan in June of 2019 remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. \n\n&#8226; 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2019 Plan&#8221;) &#8211; The 2019 Plan permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, and other stock-based awards. \n\n&#8226; Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan (the &#8220;Director Plan&#8221;) &#8211; Under the Director Plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors. In general, the plan requires that 50 % of eligible Directors&#8217; annual compensation and dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation and have an equivalent number of shares credited to their deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to \n\nprovide consideration to us other than rendering service.

From the merger date, no additional awards under these plans may be granted; however, the outstanding awards that were converted at the merger date continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. \n\nThe number of common shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2022 2021 \n\nShares available for granting 1 \n\n19.3 19.5 Options outstanding 0.2 0.3 Total shares reserved for issuance 19.5 19.8 ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Shares reserved for issuance under the Director Plan are less t han 1.0 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nWe issue treasury shares upon exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock other stock-based awards. To offset the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans, we periodically repurchase shares.

Stock options granted vest over a four-year service period and have a maximum term of 10 years. Stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant, utilizing a four-year graded vesting method. Under this method, more than half of the costs are recognized over the first twelve months , approximately one-quarter of the costs are recognized over a twenty-four month period starting from the date of grant, approximately one-tenth of the costs are recognized over a thirty-six month period starting from the date of grant, and the remaining costs are recognized over a forty-eight month period starting from the date of grant. \n\nThere were no stock options granted in 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nStock option activity is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except per award amounts) Shares Weighted average exercise price Weighted-average remaining years of contractual term Aggregate intrinsic value \n\nOptions outstanding as of December 31, 2021 \n\n0.3 &#160; $ 67.14 &#160; Assumed 1 \n\n&#8212; &#160; $ 97.29 &#160; Exercised ( 0.1 ) $ 80.88 &#160; \n\nOptions outstanding as of December 31, 2022 \n\n0.2 &#160; $ 68.02 &#160; 1.01 $ 67 &#160; \n\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2022 \n\n0.2 &#160; $ 68.02 &#160; 1.01 $ 67 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 There are less than 0.1 million options that were assumed as part of the merger with IHS Markit. \n\nInformation regarding our stock option exercises is as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options $ 7 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 16 &#160; Total intrinsic value of stock option exercises $ 13 &#160; $ 41 &#160; $ 60 &#160; Income tax benefit realized from stock option exercises $ 4 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 13 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRestricted Stock and Other Stock-Based Awards \n\nRestricted stock and other stock-based awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan and 2019 Plan. Performance unit awards only vest if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally three years ). Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. \n\nThe stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and other stock-based awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest.

The quarterly dividend rate was $ 0.77 per share and $ 0.67 per share for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nStock Repurchases \n\nOn June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the &#8220;2022 Repurchase Program&#8221;), which was approximately 9 % of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the &#8220;2020 Repurchase Program&#8221;), which was approximately 12 % of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 50 million shares (the &#8220;2013 Repurchase Program&#8221;), which was approximately 18 % of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. \n\nOur purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2022, 27.2 million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the 2020 and 2013 repurchase programs were completed. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. \n\nWe have entered into accelerated share repurchase (&#8220;ASR&#8221;) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as two transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts were classified as equity instruments. \n\nThe terms of each ASR agreement entered into for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, structured as outlined above, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except average price) ASR Agreement Initiation Date ASR Agreement Completion Date Initial Shares Delivered Additional Shares Delivered Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Cash Utilized \n\nDecember 2, 2022 1 \n\n2.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.4 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,000 &#160; \n\nAugust 9, 2022 2 \n\nOctober 25, 2022 5.8 &#160; 1.6 &#160; 7.4 &#160; $ 337.94 &#160; $ 2,500 &#160; \n\nMay 13, 2022 3 \n\nAugust 2, 2022 3.8 &#160; 0.6 &#160; 4.4 &#160; $ 343.85 &#160; $ 1,500 &#160; \n\nMarch 1, 2022 4 \n\nAugust 9, 2022 15.2 &#160; 4.1 &#160; 19.3 &#160; $ 362.03 &#160; $ 7,000 &#160; \n\nFebruary 11, 2020 5 \n\nJuly 27, 2020 1.3 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 1.7 &#160; $ 292.13 &#160; $ 500 &#160; \n\nFebruary 11, 2020 6 \n\nJuly 27, 2020 1.4 &#160; 0.3 &#160; 1.7 &#160; $ 292.13 &#160; $ 500 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $ 1 billion and initially received shares valued at 87.5 % of the $ 1 billion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on December 2, 2022 when the Company received an initial delivery of 2.4 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on February 3, 2023 and received an additional 0.4 million shares. We repurchased a total of 2.8 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price $ 350.74 per share. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program. \n\n2 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $ 2.5 billion and initially received shares valued at 87.5 % of the $ 2.5 billion at a price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on August 9, 2022 when the Company received an initial delivery of 5.8 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on October 25, 2022 and received an additional 1.6 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 and 2020 Repurchase Program. \n\n3 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $ 1.5 billion and initially received shares valued at 85 % of the $ 1.5 billion at a share price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on May 13, 2022 when the Company received an initial delivery of 3.8 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 2, 2022 and received an additional 0.6 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program. \n\n4 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $ 7 billion and initially received shares valued at 85 % of the $ 7 billion at a share equal to the then market price of the Company's common stock on March 1, 2022 when the company received an initial delivery of 15.2 million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on August 9, 2022 and received an additional 4.1 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2020 Repurchase Program. \n\n5 The ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid $ 500 million and received an initial delivery of 1.3 million shares and an additional amount of 0.2 million in February 2020, representing a minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share. We completed the ASR agreement on July 27, 2020 and received an additional 0.2 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2013 Repurchase Program. \n\n6 The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $ 500 million and received an initial delivery of 1.4 million shares, representing 85 % of the $ 500 at a price equal to the then market price of the Company. We completed the ASR agreement on July 27, 2020 and received an additional 0.3 million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2013 Repurchase Program. \n\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased shares of our common stock in the open market as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except average price) Year Ended Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share Total cash utilized December 31, 2020 0.5 &#160; $ 295.40 &#160; $ 161 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased a total of 33.5 million shares for $ 12.0 billion of cash. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not use cash to purchase any shares. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased a total of 4.0 million shares for $ 1,161 million of cash. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased shares for $ 3 million, which settled in the first quarter of 2020, resulting in $ 1,164 million of cash used to repurchase shares. \n\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests \n\nThe agreement with the minority partners that own 27 % of our S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (&#8220;CGIS&#8221;) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20 % of their share in S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the 15 days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest. \n\nIf interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption &#8220;Redeemable noncontrolling interest&#8221; with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&#38;P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific \n\nbeta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. \n\nNoncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity. \n\nCh anges to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the year ended December 31, 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 3,429 &#160; Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest 249 &#160; Equity contribution from redeemable noncontrolling intrerest 410 &#160; Distributions to noncontrolling interest ( 278 ) Redemption value adjustment ( 545 ) Other 1 \n\n2 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 3,267 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Relates to foreign currency translation adjustments \n\nOn June 1, 2022 the Company contributed its interest in the IHSM Indices acquired as part of the Merger to S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. The IHSM Indices will be operated, managed, and distributed by S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. CME Group paid the Company $ 410 million in exchange for both a 27 % ownership of IHSM&#8217;s Indices and to maintain their 27 % proportionate ownership in the S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture. \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss \n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments 1,3 \n\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans 2 \n\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) \n\non Cash Flow Hedges 3 \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ ( 336 ) $ ( 305 ) $ ( 200 ) $ ( 841 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications ( 250 ) ( 53 ) 236 &#160; ( 67 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net earnings 4 &#160; 9 &#160; 2 9 &#160; 3 22 &#160; Net other comprehensive gain (loss) income \n\n( 246 ) ( 44 ) 245 &#160; ( 45 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ ( 582 ) $ ( 349 ) $ 45 &#160; $ ( 886 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n1 Includes an unrealized gain related to our cross currency swaps.

See Note 7 &#8212; Employee Benefits for additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings. \n\n3 See Note 6 &#8211; Derivative Instruments for additional details of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings. \n\n10. Earnings per Share \n\nBasic earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted performance shares calculated using the treasury stock method. \n\nThe calculation for basic and diluted EPS is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Amount attributable to S&#38;P Global Inc. common shareholders: \n\nNet income $ 3,248 &#160; $ 3,024 &#160; $ 2,339 &#160; Basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 316.9 &#160; 240.8 &#160; 241.0 &#160; Effect of stock options and other dilutive securities 1.6 &#160; 1.0 &#160; 1.1 &#160; Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 318.5 &#160; 241.8 &#160; 242.1 &#160; Earnings per share attributable to S&#38;P Global Inc. common shareholders: \n\nNet income: Basic $ 10.25 &#160; $ 12.56 &#160; $ 9.71 &#160; Diluted $ 10.20 &#160; $ 12.51 &#160; $ 9.66 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. As of December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020, there were no stock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstanding of 0.6 million as of December 31, 2022, 0.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and 0.4 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively, were excluded. \n\n11. Restructuring \n\nWe continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2022 and 2021 restructuring plans consisted of company-wide workforce reductions of approximately 1,440 and 30 positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed. \n\nThe initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of December 31, 2022 by segment is as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 Restructuring Plan 2021 Restructuring Plan (in millions) Initial Charge Recorded Ending Reserve Balance Initial Charge Recorded Ending Reserve Balance Market Intelligence $ 86 &#160; $ 59 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 2 &#160; Ratings 26 &#160; 17 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; Commodity Insights 45 &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mobility 2 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Indices 13 &#160; 11 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Engineering Solutions 2 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Corporate 109 &#160; 49 &#160; 13 &#160; 6 &#160; Total $ 283 &#160; $ 164 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 10 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $ 283 million primarily related to employee severance charges for the 2022 restructuring plan and have reduced the reserve by $ 119 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we have reduced the reserve for the 2021 restructuring plan by $ 9 million. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges. \n\n12. Segment and Geographic Information \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Accounting Policies , we have six reportable segments: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility, Indices, and Engineering Solutions. \n\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit.

Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLeases \n\nWe determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement. We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 14 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices. \n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses. \n\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The February 28, 2022 merger with IHS Markit resulted in an increase in ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of $ 230 million and $ 268 million, respectively. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 132 million, $ 31 million and $ 120 million, respectively, related to the impairment and abandonment of operating lease related ROU assets. The pre-tax impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily associated with reductions in the anticipated sublease income on vacated leased facilities following the deterioration of local market conditions and consolidating our real estate facilities following the merger with IHS Markit. The impairment charges are included in selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income. \n\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 Balance Sheet Location Assets Right of use assets Lease right-of-use assets $ 423 &#160; $ 426 &#160; Liabilities Other current liabilities Current lease liabilities 118 &#160; 96 &#160; Lease liabilities &#8212; non-current Non-current lease liabilities 577 &#160; 492 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31 are as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 147 &#160; $ 124 &#160; $ 144 &#160; Sublease income ( 5 ) ( 2 ) ( 6 ) Total lease cost $ 142 &#160; $ 122 &#160; $ 138 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental information related to leases for the years ended December 31 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement for operating lease liabilities Operating cash flows for operating leases 159 &#160; 127 &#160; 137 &#160; Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations Operating leases 6 &#160; 29 &#160; 8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases as of December 31 are as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) 6.6 8.3 Weighted-average discount rate 3.17 &#160; % 3.59 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nMaturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2023 $ 138 &#160; 2024 114 &#160; 2025 102 &#160; 2026 88 &#160; 2027 82 &#160; 2028 and beyond 261 &#160; Total undiscounted lease payments $ 785 &#160; Less: Imputed interest 90 &#160; Present value of lease liabilities $ 695 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nRelated Party Agreement \n\nIn June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the \"License Agreement\") with the holder of S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, which replaced the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $ 170 million, $ 139 million and $ 149 million of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement, respectively. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the 27 % noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. \n\nLegal &#38; Regulatory Matters \n\nIn the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. \n\nOn November 14, 2022, S&#38;P Global Ratings reached a settlement with the SEC to resolve an SEC investigation into violations of Section 15E of the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5(c)(8) thereunder involving the ratings assigned to a single residential mortgage-backed securities transaction in 2017. The investigation was previously disclosed. S&#38;P Global Ratings did not admit or deny the SEC&#8217;s allegations. In the SEC&#8217;s order, the SEC acknowledged S&#38;P Global Ratings&#8217; remedial acts and its cooperation with the SEC staff. As part of the resolution, the Company agreed to pay a penalty of $ 2.5 million that was previously reserved for in 2021. \n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company. A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by two entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis. We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company receives customer complaints, particularly, though not exclusively, in its Ratings and Indices segments. The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers. Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints. The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters. \n\nMoreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&#38;P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S&#38;P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&#38;P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. \n\nIn view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nWe have filed the required certifications under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 incorporated herein by reference from Exhibits (31.1) and (31.2) to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition we have filed the required certifications under Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 incorporated herein by reference from Exhibit (32) to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nThis Item 9A. includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in the required certifications. \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed so that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, management is required to provide the following report on our internal control over financial reporting: \n\n1. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. \n\n2. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the system of internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (&#8220;COSO 2013 framework&#8221;). Management has selected the COSO 2013 framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurement of our internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting. \n\n3. Based on management&#8217;s evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. There are no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by management. \n\n4. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &#38; Young LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and has issued their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 71, 72, 73 and 74 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"
