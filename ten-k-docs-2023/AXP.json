BUSINESS \n\nOverview \n\nAmerican Express is a globally integrated payments company, providing customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. We are a leader in providing credit and charge cards to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. American Express &#174; cards issued by us, as well as by third-party banks and other institutions on the American Express network, can be used by Card Members to charge purchases at the millions of merchants around the world that accept cards bearing our logo. \n\nOur various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams and direct response advertising. \n\nWe were founded in 1850 as a joint stock association and were incorporated in 1965 as a New York corporation. American Express Company and its principal operating subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), are bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). \n\nWe principally engage in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate &#38; Other. Our businesses function together to form our end-to-end integrated payments platform, which we believe is a differentiator that underpins our business model. For further information about our reportable operating segments, please see &#8220;Business Segment Results of Operations&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; \n\nOur Integrated Payments Platform \n\nThrough our general-purpose card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses, we are able to connect participants and provide differentiated value across the commerce path. We maintain direct relationships with both our Card Members (as a card issuer) and merchants (as an acquirer), and we handle all key aspects of those relationships. These relationships create a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; in that we have direct access to information at both ends of the card transaction, which distinguishes our integrated payments platform from the bankcard networks. \n\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to analyze information on Card Member spending and build algorithms and other analytical tools that we use to underwrite risk, reduce fraud and provide targeted marketing and other information services for merchants and partners and special offers and services to Card Members, all while respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements. Through contractual relationships, we also obtain information from third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we do business. \n\nCard Issuing Businesses \n\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses are conducted through our USCS, CS and ICS reportable operating segments. We offer a broad set of card products, rewards and services to a diverse consumer and commercial customer base, in the United States and internationally. We acquire and retain high-spending, engaged and creditworthy Card Members by: \n\n&#8226; Designing innovative products and features that appeal to our target customer base and meet their spending and borrowing needs \n\n&#8226; Using incentives to drive spending on our various card products and increase customer engagement, including our Membership Rewards &#174; program, cash-back reward features, interest rates offered on deposits and participation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners \n\n&#8226; Providing digital and mobile services and an array of benefits and experiences across card products, such as airport lounge access, dining experiences and other travel and lifestyle benefits \n\n&#8226; Creating world-class service experiences by delivering exceptional customer care \n\n&#8226; Developing a wide range of partner relationships, including with other corporations and institutions that sponsor certain of our cards under cobrand arrangements and provide benefits and services to our Card Members \n\nOver the last several years, we have focused on broadening the appeal of our products to attract new customers, particularly Millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our position with small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. We have also introduced new adjacent products that complement our existing products, such as our business checking and consumer rewards checking account products and new digital capabilities, which in part result from our acquisitions of Kabbage, Resy and acompay. Additionally, we have evolved our card issuing businesses by bringing together our consumer, SME and large commercial issuing activities outside of the United States into a new ICS organization to enable a greater focus on local priorities. Jurisdictions that represent a significant portion of our billed business outside of the United States include the United Kingdom (UK), the European Union (EU), Australia, Japan, Canada and Mexico. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1,338 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 76.7 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide. \n\nMerchant Acquiring Business \n\nOur GMNS reportable operating segment builds and manages relationships with millions of merchants around the world that choose to accept American Express cards. This includes signing new merchants to accept our cards, agreeing on the discount rate (a fee charged to the merchant for accepting our cards) and handling servicing for merchants. We also build and maintain relationships with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage aspects of our merchant services business. For example, through our OptBlue &#174; merchant-acquiring program, third-party acquirers contract directly with small merchants for card acceptance on our network and determine merchant pricing. We continue to grow merchant acceptance of American Express cards around the world and work with merchant partners so that our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their American Express cards are accepted. We also seek to drive greater usage of the American Express network by deepening merchant engagement and increasing Card Member awareness through initiatives such as our Shop Small campaigns and deploying new payment options such as debit and B2B capabilities. \n\nGMNS also provides fraud-prevention tools, marketing solutions, data analytics and other programs and services to merchants and other partners that leverage the capabilities of our integrated payments platform. \n\nCard Network Business \n\nWe operate a payments network through which we establish and maintain relationships with third-party banks and other institutions in approximately 103 countries and territories, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of our global network. These network partners are licensed to issue local currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was $214.5 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 56.5 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide. \n\nDiverse Customer Base and Global Footprint \n\nOur broad and diverse customer base spans consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world. The following chart provides a summary of our diverse set of customers and broad geographic footprint based on worldwide network volumes: \n\nPartners and Relationships \n\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners, and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the platform. \n\nThere are many examples of how we connect partners with our integrated payments platform, including: issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions (e.g., Delta Air Lines (Delta), Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide Holdings and British Airways); offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants (e.g., Pay with Points at Amazon.com); expanding merchant acceptance with third-party acquirers (e.g., OptBlue partners); operating through joint ventures in certain jurisdictions (e.g., in China, the Middle East and Switzerland); developing new capabilities and features with our digital partners (e.g., PayPal and i2c); integrating into the supplier payment processes of our business customers (e.g., BILL, BillTrust and Versapay); and extending the platform into travel services with American Express leisure and business travel (e.g., Fine Hotels and Resorts). We also have a significant ownership position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, Global Business Travel Group, Inc. (GBTG), which provides business travel-related services. \n\nDelta is our largest strategic partner. Our relationships with, and revenues and expenses related to, Delta are significant and represent an important source of value for our Card Members. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio represented approximately 10 percent of worldwide network volumes and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2022. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. The current Delta cobrand agreement runs through the end of 2029 and we expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership. Among other things, Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits and services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer. \n\nWorking with all of our partners, we seek to provide value, choice and unique experiences across our customer base. \n\nOur Spend-Centric Model and Revenue Mix \n\nOur &#8220;spend-centric&#8221; business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees. Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards. \n\nWe believe our spend-centric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members, merchants and business partners. \n\nThe American Express Brand and Service Excellence \n\nOur brand and its attributes&#8212;trust, security and service&#8212;are key assets. We invest heavily in managing, marketing, promoting and protecting our brand, including through the delivery of our products and services in a manner consistent with our brand promise. The American Express brand is ranked among the most valuable brands in the world. We place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world. \n\nWe aim to provide the world&#8217;s best customer experience every day and our reputation for world-class service has been recognized by numerous awards over the years. Our customer care professionals, travel consultants and partners treat servicing interactions as an opportunity to bring the brand to life for our customers, add meaningful value and deepen relationships. \n\nOur Business Strategies \n\nWe seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives: \n\nFirst, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers&#8217; everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers. \n\nSecond, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers. \n\nThird, we are focused on strengthening our global, integrated network by continuing to increase merchant acceptance, providing merchants with fraud protection services, marketing insights and connections to higher-spending Card Members and working with our network partners to offer expanded products and services. \n\nFinally, we want to continue to build on our unique global position, seeking ways to use our differentiated business model and global presence as we progress against our other strategic imperatives. \n\nWe previously had as a strategic imperative to make American Express an essential part of our customers&#8217; digital lives, which we believe has become embedded in our company and is inherent in the work we do in furtherance of our strategic imperatives. \n\nWe also have an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy that focuses on three pillars. The Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&#38;I) pillar supports a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce, marketplace and society. The Advancing Climate Solutions pillar focuses on enhancing our operations and capabilities to meet customer and community needs in the transition to a low-carbon future. Finally, the Building Financial Confidence pillar seeks to provide responsible, secure and transparent products and services to help people and businesses build financial resilience. \n\nOur Colleagues \n\nWe are focused on our culture built on supportive relationships and an inclusive workplace, where colleagues can feel welcome and heard, and are provided with opportunities to grow and thrive. As a result, we believe our colleagues are more engaged, committed, creative and effective in driving results. At the heart of our culture is what we call our Blue Box Values &#8211; a set of guiding principles that serve as the foundation for how we operate: ##TABLE_START We Do What's Right We Embrace Diversity We Back Our Customers We Stand for Equity and Inclusion We Make It Great We Win as A Team We Respect People We Support Communities ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 77,300 people, whom we refer to as colleagues, with approximately 26,000 colleagues in the United States and approximately 51,300 colleagues outside the United States. We added colleagues in 2022 to support our strong business growth. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to offer a compelling value proposition to our colleagues, including competitive compensation and leading benefits. We continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We provide learning opportunities in many forms, including tools and guidance for maximizing learning on the job; cross-border and cross-business unit assignments; career coaching, mentoring and professional networking; rotation opportunities; virtual learning sessions; and formal classroom instruction. The health and wellness of our colleagues continue to be priorities for us and we take a holistic approach to well-being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and mental health of our colleagues. Throughout 2022, we launched Amex Flex across our offices, where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in the office, at home or take a hybrid approach that combines both. This approach is designed to enable us to both broaden the talent pool from which we can attract candidates and increase colleague retention. \n\nWe conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues&#8217; needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO-1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self-identified characteristics). \n\nWe regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and regardless of race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2022 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States. \n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers \n\nSet forth below, in alphabetical order, is a list of our executive officers as of February 10, 2023, including each executive officer&#8217;s principal occupation and employment during the past five years and reflecting recent organizational changes. None of our executive officers has any family relationship with any other executive officer, and none of our executive officers became an officer pursuant to any arrangement or understanding with any other person. Each executive officer has been elected to serve until the next annual election of officers or until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Each officer&#8217;s age is indicated by the number in parentheses next to his or her name. ##TABLE_START DOUGLAS E.

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs, some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic, such as an increased shift to digital payments. \n\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards. We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports. \n\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, China UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind China UnionPay, Visa and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Venmo), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India), carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business. \n\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include: \n\n&#8226; The features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits, and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services \n\n&#8226; Reputation and brand recognition \n\n&#8226; The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers \n\n&#8226; The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used \n\n&#8226; The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, cardholders, corporate clients and merchants (including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics) \n\n&#8226; The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers \n\n&#8226; The success of marketing and promotional campaigns \n\n&#8226; The speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies and product and service offerings \n\n&#8226; The nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers \n\n&#8226; The security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information \n\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment facilitators and aggregators, digital payment, open banking and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closed-loop, loyalty and rewards functionalities, such as ours. \n\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see &#8220; Our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry &#8221; in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business, and &#8220; Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition&#8221; and &#8220; Legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand &#8221; in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulations or if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products. \n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION \n\nOverview \n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment. \n\nGovernmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations, and as a result, we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. \n\nPolicymakers around the world continue to propose and adopt new laws and regulations governing a wide variety of issues that may impact our business or change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. For example, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks, resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes. \n\nSee &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks&#8221; for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nBanking Regulation \n\nFederal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company, TRS and our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB). For purposes of this Supervision and Regulation section, the &#8220;Company&#8221; refers only to American Express Company, a bank holding company, and does not include its subsidiaries. Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is supervised, regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures, any of which could compromise our competitive position. Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and by non-U.S. government agencies and regulatory bodies. \n\nActivities \n\nThe BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities. As noted above, each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities. In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status, we must meet certain eligibility requirements. Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; and AENB must have received at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of \n\nactivities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that regulatory authorities deem unsafe or unsound (which such authorities generally interpret broadly) and regulatory authorities have discretion in determining whether new or modified activities can be conducted in a safe and sound manner. \n\nAcquisitions and Investments \n\nApplicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators. In addition, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and, in some cases, subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval. \n\nFinancial Regulatory Reform \n\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Under these rules, each bank holding company, as well as its bank subsidiaries, is assigned to one of four categories based on its status as a U.S. global systemically important banking organization and five other risk-based indicators: (i) total assets, (ii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iii) non-bank assets, (iv) off-balance sheet exposure, and (v) weighted short-term wholesale funding. \n\nUnder these rules, the Company (and its depository institution subsidiary, AENB) is subject to Category IV standards. \n\nBecause a firm&#8217;s categorization is determined by, and can change over time dependent upon, how the firm measures against the risk-based indicator thresholds, we are required to monitor and periodically report these risk-based indicators and there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be a Category IV firm in the future. \n\nCapital and Liquidity Regulation \n\nCapital Rules \n\nThe Company and AENB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators. These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions (collectively, banking organizations) have adequate capital given their level of assets and off-balance sheet obligations. The federal banking regulators&#8217; current capital rules (the Capital Rules) implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (the Basel Committee) framework for strengthening international capital regulation, known as Basel III. For additional information regarding our capital ratios, see &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; \n\nUnder the Capital Rules, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. We report our capital adequacy ratios using risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. As a Category IV firm, we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements. \n\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that, among other things, revise the standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain &#8220;unconditionally cancellable commitments&#8221; such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements. In September 2022, federal banking regulators announced that they are reaffirming their commitment to implement enhanced regulatory capital requirements that align with the standards issued by the Basel Committee in December 2017 and that they are developing a joint proposed rule for issuance. If adopted in the United States as issued by the Basel Committee and applicable to us, the new standards are likely to result in higher capital requirements for us. \n\nIn December 2018, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional three-year phase-in period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments, which became effective January 1, 2020. In August 2020, federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for up to two years, followed by the three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning in January 1, 2022. We elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by the three-year phase-in period. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has phased in 50 percent of such amount. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221; for additional information on CECL. \n\nThe Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with a floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding company&#8217;s starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve's stress tests described below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. \n\nOn August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in June 2021. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB requirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations whose ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets are below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities, and executive compensation. A bank holding company&#8217;s SCB requirement is effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan, as discussed below. \n\nWe are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#8217;s Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent. \n\nLiquidity Regulation \n\nThe Federal Reserve&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements. The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of highly liquid assets, that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios, and a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that measures a firm&#8217;s high-quality liquid assets to its projected net outflows. Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as the Company, are not subject to a specific LCR requirement. \n\nA second standard provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), requires a minimum amount of longer-term funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities. Under the NSFR rule, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as the Company, are not subject to a specific NSFR requirement. \n\nStress Testing and Capital Planning \n\nUnder the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, the Company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions. As part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve uses pro-forma capital positions and ratios under such stress scenarios to determine the size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm. \n\nAs a Category IV firm, the Company is required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year and was most recently subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s supervisory stress tests in 2022. The Company is required to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan on or before April 5 of each year. \n\nFor Category IV firms, such as the Company, the portion of the SCB based on the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests is calculated every other year. During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm receives an updated SCB that reflects the firm's updated planned common stock dividends. A Category IV firm can elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in an &#8220; off year&#8221; and consequently receive an updated SCB. \n\nWe may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition. If we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument. \n\nDividends and Other Capital Distributions \n\nThe Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company&#8217;s insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. \n\nCommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve, as described above. The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if, among other things, (i) the Company's regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan. \n\nIn general, federal laws and regulations prohibit, without first obtaining the OCC&#8217;s approval, AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS, if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution. \n\nPrompt Corrective Action \n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. In order to be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. \n\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits. \n\nResolution Planning \n\nCertain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the company&#8217;s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure. However, Category IV firms, such as the Company, are not required to submit a holding company resolution plan. \n\nAENB continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the FDIC that would enable the FDIC, as receiver, to effectively resolve AENB under the FDIA in the event of failure. Under the FDIC's rule and its accompanying June 2021 statement on resolution plans for insured depository institutions, insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, such as AENB, are required to submit resolution plans on a three-year cycle. AENB submitted its most recent resolution plan in December 2022, as required. \n\nOrderly Liquidation Authority \n\nThe Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution, if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. As under the FDIC resolution model, under the OLA, the FDIC has broad power as receiver. Substantial differences exist, however, between the OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a &#8220;bridge&#8221; entity. \n\nThe FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA, referred to as the &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; or &#8220;SPOE&#8221; strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a &#8220;bridge&#8221; holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure. \n\nFDIC Powers upon Insolvency of AENB \n\nIf the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of AENB, the FDIC has the power to: (1) transfer any of AENB&#8217;s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of AENB&#8217;s creditors; (2) enforce the terms of AENB&#8217;s contracts pursuant to their terms; or (3) repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which AENB is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of AENB. In addition, the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against AENB would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against AENB, including claims of debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of AENB. As a result, regardless of whether the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of AENB, the debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices would be treated differently from, and could receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in the U.S. offices of AENB. \n\nOther Banking Regulations \n\nSource of Strength \n\nThe Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support AENB. Such support may be required at times when, absent this requirement, the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it. Capital loans by the Company to AENB are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of AENB. In the event of the Company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of AENB will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. \n\nTransactions Between AENB and its Affiliates \n\nCertain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from AENB) between AENB and its affiliates (including the Company, TRS and their other subsidiaries) are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. \n\nFDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments \n\nAENB accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution&#8217;s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that would lead to termination of deposit insurance at AENB. The FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, including AENB, which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC. \n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act \n\nAENB is subject to the CRA, which imposes affirmative, ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. In May 2022, the federal banking agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking proposing revisions to the CRA regulations, including with respect to the delineation of assessment areas, the overall evaluation framework and performance standards and metrics, the definition of community development activities and data collection and reporting. \n\nClimate Risk Management \n\nThe U.S. banking agencies have recently increased their focus on climate risk-related supervision. For example, on December 16, 2021, the OCC issued for public comment a set of proposed &#8220;Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.&#8221; The principles would apply to OCC-regulated institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, like AENB, and are broadly designed to provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks consistent with existing OCC rules and guidance. The principles outline six key aspects of climate-related financial risk management: governance; policies, procedures and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. In addition, the principles offer risk assessment guidance for incorporating climate-related financial risks in various traditional risk categories. On March 30, 2022 and December 2, 2022, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, respectively, also issued for public comment substantially similar sets of draft principles targeted at financial institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $100 billion subject to their respective supervision, including, with respect to the Federal Reserve, the Company. It is too early to determine what regulations and policies may be adopted or apply to the Company and AENB and the effect of any such regulations or policies on the Company and AENB. \n\nConsumer Financial Products Regulation \n\nOur consumer-oriented activities are subject to regulation and supervision in the United States and internationally. In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products, and authority to prevent &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts or practices. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. \n\nOn February 1, 2023, the CFPB issued a proposed rule to lower the safe harbor amount that would be considered, by regulation, to be &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments. The proposed rule would also eliminate the annual inflation adjustment for such safe harbor amount and prohibit late fee amounts above 25 percent of the consumer's required minimum payment. The rule proposal, if adopted, is not expected to become effective before 2024. \n\nWe are also regulated in the United States under the &#8220;money transmitter&#8221; or &#8220;sale of check&#8221; laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services. \n\nIn countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. Regulators&#8217; expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm&#8217;s systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues. \n\nPayments Regulation \n\nLegislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. \n\nThe EU, Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions, for example. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. See &#8220; Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition &#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Effective October 6, 2022, merchants in Canada (other than in Quebec) are now permitted to surcharge credit card purchases up to a maximum of 2.4 percent as a result of a litigation settlement with Visa and Mastercard. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. See &#8220; Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations &#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nIn some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks, issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. In 2021, it imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp. from engaging in certain card issuing activities in India, which were lifted in August 2022 following significant investment in technology, infrastructure and resources to comply with the regulation. The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. \n\nPrivacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security \n\nRegulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established, and continue to maintain, policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws and requirements, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. \n\nOur regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection, data governance and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access. Regulators are also focused on data management, resiliency and business continuity, and third-party risk management policies and practices. \n\nIn the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy, disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and its implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers&#8217; nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process. We have also expanded privacy rights to California residents who are not covered by GLBA, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020. Various regulators, U.S. states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws, rules and regulations pertaining to privacy and/or information and cyber security that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements. \n\nWe are also subject to certain privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate (including countries in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom), some of which are more stringent and/or expansive than those in the United States and some of which may conflict with each other. Some countries and the EU have instituted or are considering instituting requirements that make it onerous to transfer personal data to other jurisdictions. Other countries may require in-country data processing and/or in-country storage of data. Compliance with such laws results in higher technology, administrative and other costs for us, could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closed-loop data, and could require use of local technology services. Some of these laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property. Data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications and regulatory activity and laws around resiliency, business continuity and third-party risk management are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate. \n\nIn Europe, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU, irrespective of the geographical location of the company, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue). The GDPR includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to affected individuals and supervisory authorities. The UK GDPR mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the GDPR. In October 2022, an Executive Order was signed that, together with regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, would implement a new data privacy framework for cross border transfers of EU personal data to the United States. \n\nAnti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance \n\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences. \n\nAnti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism \n\nWe are subject to a significant number of AML/CFT laws and regulations globally. \n\nIn the United States, the majority of AML/CFT requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML/CFT laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, the effects of which are not known at this time. \n\nIn Europe, AML/CFT requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand and Russia, have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML/CFT legislation and regulations applicable to American Express. \n\nAmong other things, these laws and regulations require us to establish AML/CFT programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain Member States in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions. \n\nEconomic Sanctions \n\nNational governments and international bodies, such as the United Nations and the EU, have imposed economic sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels, governments and countries that endanger their interests or violate international norms of behavior. Sanctions have been used to advance a range of foreign policy goals, including conflict resolution, counterterrorism, counternarcotics and promotion of democracy and human rights, among other national and international interests. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties. \n\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as &#8220;Specially Designated Nationals,&#8221; such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, without a license or other authorization. These prohibitions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to a targeted individual, entity, vessel, government or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity, vessel, government or country has an interest, and prohibit transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons) to such individual, entity, vessel, government or country. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. \n\nWe maintain a global sanctions compliance program designed to meet the requirements of applicable sanctions regimes. \n\nAnti-Corruption \n\nWe are subject to complex anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure by us or our colleagues, contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us and/or individual colleagues to investigation, prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties. \n\nCompensation Practices \n\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The federal banking regulators&#8217; guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. In 2016, the federal banking regulators, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration proposed revised rules on incentive-based compensation practices, which have not yet been finalized. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues, which could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key colleagues. \n\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a new rule directing national securities exchanges to require policies mandating, in the case of a restatement of previously issued financial statements, the recovery of excess incentive-based compensation paid to current or former executive officers and requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by any such restatement. \n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \n\nWe maintain an Investor Relations website at http://ir.americanexpress.com. We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. \n\nIn addition, we routinely post financial and other information, some of which could be material to investors, on our Investor Relations website. Information regarding our corporate sustainability initiatives, including our Environmental, Social and Governance reports, are available on the Corporate Sustainability section of our website at http://about.americanexpress.com/corporate-sustainability. \n\nThe content of any of our websites referred to in this report is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. We have included such website addresses only as inactive textual references and do not intend them to be active links. \n\nYou can find certain statistical disclosures required of bank holding companies starting on page A-1, which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\nOur business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although network volumes tend to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result, the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter. The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retail-related billed business. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nThis section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized as &#8220;Strategic, Business and Competitive Risks,&#8221; &#8220;Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks&#8221; and &#8220;Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks.&#8221; You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; section under &#8220;MD&#38;A,&#8221; which describes our approach to identifying, monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. \n\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks \n\nBusiness and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business and economic environment may materially adversely affect our business. \n\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, and demand for fee-based products and services. \n\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, household income and housing prices, unemployment rates, business investment and inventory levels, bankruptcies, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine), public policy decisions, government spending, international trade relationships, interest rates, taxes, inflation and deflation (including the effects of related governmental responses), energy costs, availability of capital and credit and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Recently, levels of inflation have been significantly elevated. Sustained periods of high inflation may, among other things, increase certain of our expenses and erode consumer purchasing power, confidence and spending. An economic downturn or recession may result in higher unemployment and lower household income, consumer spending, corporate earnings and business investment, which may negatively impact spending on our cards and demand for our products, and increase delinquencies and write-off rates. \n\nTravel and entertainment (T&#38;E) expenditures, which comprised approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2022, for example, are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small business and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 45 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2022, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation. Increases in delinquencies and write-off rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies, unemployment rates, changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe and can impact customer types and geographies in which we operate in very different ways. \n\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. \n\nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, information or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation or unavailability of systems or technology by cyberattacks), operational incidents, and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, including actions aimed at upending geopolitical stability, fiscal and monetary policies (including developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling), trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional or domestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for credit. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism, limitations on travel and mobility and health-related risks. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel protection products we offer. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had, and continues to have, widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and consumer and business spending. The pandemic and resulting containment measures adversely impacted a significant portion of our network volumes. The global macroeconomic outlook continues to remain uncertain due to a variety of factors, including the emergence of new variants, impacts to the labor market, supply chain disruptions and inflation, and the impacts of the pandemic may continue even as the pandemic subsides. The extent to which our business and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the lingering impacts of the pandemic will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, including the continued spread and severity of the virus and new variants; the imposition or concern relating to the possible imposition of further containment measures; the availability, distribution, use and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact on consumers and businesses as forbearance and government support programs end; the continued stress on businesses due to operational changes and staffing issues; and the extent of the continued resumption of normal operating conditions and customer behaviors. \n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we suspended all business operations in Russia and Belarus and this conflict has led to economic uncertainty and market disruptions, including heightened energy prices, and the imposition of financial and economic sanctions and export controls designed to constrain Russia. The broader consequences of this conflict remain uncertain, but may include further sanctions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, increased prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks, potential retaliatory action by customers or the Russian government against companies such as us, heightened regulatory scrutiny related to sanctions compliance, increased inflation, further increases or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, decreases in global travel, further disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of certain natural resources and other adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions. \n\nHurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected. Other disasters or catastrophic events in the future, and the impact of such events on certain industries or the overall economy, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and infrastructure, including our technology and systems. Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events. Card Members in California, New York, Florida, Texas, Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of U.S. consumer and small business billed business and Card Member loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states. \n\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry. \n\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively. \n\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on purchase volume. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance (including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks) and perceptions of coverage, or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards. \n\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. Government actions or initiatives may also provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages and may create new competitors, including in some cases a government entity. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending and borrowing habits as effectively as our competitors. Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we evolve our value propositions, including in response to increased competition. \n\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks, as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase. Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing providers, such as point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products. To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted. In addition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions, impacting our profitability on transactions. \n\nThe competitive value of our closed-loop data and demand for our products and services may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights and by certain regulations, such as open banking initiatives, which may result in disintermediating existing financial services providers, steering customers away from our products and services or decreasing our attractiveness to partners. \n\nTo the extent we expand into, or further grow in, new business areas and new geographic regions, such as mainland China, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions. We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions. \n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure. \n\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Delta, Marriott, Hilton and British Airways, as well as many others globally, to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including Delta and others in the airline industry, to offer benefits to Card Member participants. See &#8220;Partners and Relationships&#8221; under &#8220;Business&#8221; for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta. \n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide network volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2022. \n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships. Network volumes could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding. \n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks. \n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion &#174; and Platinum Card &#174; Members) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See &#8220; Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition&#8221; for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners. \n\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners. \n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as \n\ncobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to our &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners. \n\nSimilarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cyber security incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our network volumes, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or &#8220;flown.&#8221; If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. At December 31, 2022, our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business for purchases that had yet to be delivered by, or could be charged back to, merchants was $31.1 billion. This amount assumes all such merchants worldwide cease operations and thus are no longer available to deliver such purchases or to accept such chargebacks, and that all such billed business results in claims-in-full by Card Members. Such a maximum amount has not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures to date; however, our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the current global economic, financial and geopolitical conditions. See Note 12 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information regarding this exposure. \n\nFor additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see &#8220;Risk Management&#8212;Institutional Credit Risk&#8212;Exposure to the Airline and Travel Industry&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; \n\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. \n\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers and aggregators are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants on our behalf. As merchants become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing a merchant relationship that could materially adversely affect our network volumes, ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations. \n\nOur average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded mobile wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and network and loan volumes. \n\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members. \n\nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases and, as a result of a litigation settlement, surcharging of credit card purchases is permitted by merchants in certain jurisdictions in Canada. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant. \n\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, which could become more prevalent with the existence of debit cards on the American Express network. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members&#8217; expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. \n\nNew products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force, coverage and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. \n\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage, including through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, both of which may materially impact our profitability. \n\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers&#8217; total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand. \n\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us. \n\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment. In addition, increased costs as a result of inflation, colleague retention and recruitment, supply chain issues and shortages of materials such as chips for our cards may require that we reduce investments in other areas. \n\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace. \n\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events (including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters) and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters &#8212; even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct&#8212;could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and \n\nmaintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand. \n\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party service provider, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. Our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries, when American Express cards are used for payment for legal, but controversial, products and services or any government inquiries or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability. \n\nWe publicly share certain information about our ESG initiatives. We may face increased scrutiny related to these activities from governments, regulators, the media, investors, colleagues, customers and other stakeholders, including from parties that oppose ESG initiatives. Responding to ESG considerations and the implementation of our ESG goals and initiatives involves risk and uncertainties, requires investments and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our ESG goals and initiatives or that any such achievements will have the desired results. Our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, if at all, could impact our reputation, colleague retention and public perceptions of our business. \n\nA major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services. \n\nWe and third parties collect, process, transfer, host, store, analyze, retain, provide access to and dispose of account information, payment transaction information, and certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues in connection with our cards and other products and in the normal course of our business. \n\nGlobal financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage, hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. These threats can arise from external parties, as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information technology systems and supply chains, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites. Cyber threats, including attacks from state sponsored or nation-state actors, can increase during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. \n\nOur networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, including Card Member, travel and loyalty program data, colleague information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property. For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of distributed denial-of-service attacks from sophisticated third parties. We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change, new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. In addition, we maintain cyber crisis response procedures and regularly test our procedures to remain prepared and reduce the risk of harm to our business operations, customers and third parties in the event of an information or cyber security incident. \n\nDespite our efforts and the efforts of third parties that process, transmit or store our data and data of our customers and colleagues or support our operations, such as service providers, merchants and regulators, the possibility of information, operational and cyber security incidents, malicious social engineering, corporate espionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is \n\ndeployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices and communications platforms that are outside of our network and control environments. For example, we are aware that certain of our third-party vendors have been the victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, in some instances affecting our data or the services they provide to us. In addition, new products and services, such as checking accounts and non-card lending, may lead to an increase in the number or types of cyber attacks and our exposure to fraud and other malfeasance. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information). An incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. Our ability to address incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies. \n\nInformation, operational or cyber security incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), consent decrees, increased litigation (including class action litigation), response costs (including notification and remediation costs), fines, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, negative impacts to our partner relationships, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources. \n\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. \n\nThe uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nOur information technology systems and those of our third parties upon which we rely, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, have experienced in limited instances and may continue to experience service disruptions or degradation, which may result from technology malfunction, sudden increases in processing or other volumes, natural disasters and weather events, fires, accidents, technology change management issues, power outages, internet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and other cyberattacks, inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets, technology capacity management issues, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities in hardware or software, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events. Service disruptions or degradations can prevent access to our online services and account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data, impede or prevent transaction processing and financial reporting, disrupt ordinary business operations, result in contractual penalties or obligations, trigger regulatory reporting obligations, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight, and litigation (including class action litigation). Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations. \n\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business. \n\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers. \n\nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties' service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cyber security and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch vendors or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that was not authorized or diminishes the value of our closed loop. \n\nThe management and oversight of multiple third parties increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over third parties, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our third-party providers' service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, in certain cases there may be limited alternatives or high costs for diversification, and we also may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to the service providers of our third-party providers. \n\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected. \n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement, and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing technology. \n\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers&#8217; changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services. Our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to risks related to flaws in our algorithms and datasets that may be insufficient or contain biased information. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis such technologies produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. \n\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members or merchants, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability and brand or reputational harm. \n\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. \n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets. \n\nJoint ventures, including our joint venture in China, and minority investments in companies such as GBTG inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment, including as a result of being subject to different laws or regulations. Joint ventures and other partnerships or minority investments operating in foreign jurisdictions may also face risks from adverse regulatory actions, which could adversely affect their operations or our investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and we have been and may in the future be involved in litigation with our joint venture partners and other shareholders and parties related to the joint ventures and investments. During the second quarter of 2022, GBTG became a publicly traded company following the completion of a business combination between American Express Global Business Travel and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. We have extensive commercial arrangements with GBTG, including, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBTG uses the American Express \n\nbrand, GBTG's support of our partnerships, GBTG negotiations with travel suppliers on our behalf and a strategic relationship between GBTG and our Commercial Services business. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of a joint venture partner, other shareholders or management of our joint ventures and companies in which we have minority investments may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. In addition, trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control. The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. \n\nWe may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions, such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business. The reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past, impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended or terminated in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers&#8217; experience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. \n\nOur success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect, the resilience of our colleagues through changes in the working environment, and upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and misconduct by or loss of personnel could materially adversely affect our business. \n\nWe rely upon our personnel not only for business success, but also to act with integrity and promote a culture of respect. To the extent our colleagues behave in a manner that does not comport with our company&#8217;s values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our colleagues have had to adapt to rapidly changing conditions during the pandemic and the related return to office arrangements, and if we are unable to continue addressing the safety, health and productivity of our colleagues, as well as their expectations regarding workplace flexibility, our business could suffer. The changing nature of the office environment, such as return to office arrangements and the prevalence of remote and hybrid working, may result in increased costs and present operational and workplace culture challenges that may also adversely affect our business. \n\nThe market for qualified individuals with diverse perspectives and reflecting the diversity of our communities is highly competitive, with elevated levels of turnover in recent years, and we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals. We have and may continue to experience increased costs related to compensation and other benefits necessary to attract and retain qualified personnel. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ colleagues in the location(s) of our choice. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to attract and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture. \n\nOur operations, business, customers and partners could be materially adversely affected by climate change. \n\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers&#8217; spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could increase expenses or otherwise adversely impact our business, our customers and partners. We and other parties in our value chain are expected to be subject to additional climate and other environmental-related obligations arising from legislation and regulation in the United States and abroad. For example, banking regulators and other governmental authorities and stakeholders are increasingly focused on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions, and several of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued proposals for principles designed to provide a framework for the management of climate-related risks. Disclosure of additional climate-related information by companies has also begun to be mandated by legislation and regulators, even as the availability and quality of such information remains limited. We could also be required to change our business and management practices and experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation and changes to our technology, operations, products and services, as well as reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response to climate change and our efforts relating to the Advancing Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG strategy. Our risk management framework may not be effective in identifying, measuring and controlling our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of climate change may not be predictable. \n\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks \n\nOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts. Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, compromise our competitive position, and affect our relationships \n\nwith Card Members, partners, merchants, service providers and other third parties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase our costs of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other&#8217;s approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another. \n\nIn preparation for the completion of Brexit, numerous EU laws and regulations were separately adopted into UK domestic legislation in order to ensure continuity. However, the UK plans to evaluate the extent to which these EU-legacy laws and regulations should change going forward and has already indicated some areas where it may take a different approach from the EU. To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts, as well as potential regulatory enforcement actions and penalties. \n\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. \n\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In a ruling issued on February 7, 2018, the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. As a result, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. \n\nWe are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act and the AMLA, with regard to maintaining effective AML/CFT programs. Similar AML/CFT requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate. As regulators increase their focus in this area, new technologies such as digital currencies develop and we introduce new products like checking accounts, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain Member States in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers&#8217; association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. \n\nVarious regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards. Any new requirements may restrict our ability to issue cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could adversely affect our revenue growth. \n\nSee &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us. \n\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses, damage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nAt any given time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of possible regulation that would require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other \n\nlegal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation. \n\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. For example, as previously disclosed, in May 2020, we began responding to a review by the OCC and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to sales to small business customers in the United States. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) regarding these sales practices issues, as well as a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB pertaining to its investigation into sales practices related to consumers. In January 2023, the CFPB notified us that its investigation was completed and that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against us at this time. The OCC, DOJ and EDNY reviews and investigations are ongoing and could result in enforcement actions or other regulatory proceedings against us seeking fines or other remedial actions. We are cooperating with all inquiries. We continue to review and enhance our processes and controls related to our sales practices and business conduct generally, take disciplinary and remedial actions where appropriate, and provide information regarding our reviews to our regulators, including the Federal Reserve. \n\nWe also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions, such as a renewed focus on fair lending laws, and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions, and in connection with our ESG-related disclosures and initiatives. \n\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand. \n\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings. \n\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa&#8217;s and Mastercard&#8217;s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. \n\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, or the OCC with respect to AENB, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions. Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions. For example, if the 2017 Basel Committee revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements are adopted in the United States and applicable to us, we are likely to be required to hold significantly more capital. In addition, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital because of an increase in the SCB requirement based on results from a supervisory stress test. \n\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our U.S. bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators. \n\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see &#8220;Capital and Liquidity Regulation&#8221; under &#8220;Supervision and Regulation.&#8221; \n\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity. \n\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted. \n\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock. \n\nAmerican Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For example, our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives. \n\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see &#8220;Stress Testing and Capital Planning&#8221; and &#8220;Dividends and Other Capital Distributions&#8221; under &#8220;Supervision and Regulation,&#8221; as well as &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8212;Dividends and Share Repurchases&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221; and Note 22 to our &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information. \n\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access and information and cyber security laws, including data localization, authentication and notification laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data governance, data protection, incident management, resiliency, third party management, data transfer, security controls and account access mechanisms are in place. \n\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed-loop capability or provide certain products and services or work with certain service providers, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate. \n\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see &#8220;Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security&#8221; under &#8220;Supervision and Regulation.&#8221; \n\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed. \n\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment (e.g., natural disasters). Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party&#8217;s compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third parties. As processes or organizations are changed, or new products and services are introduced, such as new lending features, debit products and checking accounts, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, legal liability, fines, sanctions, customer remediation and brand damage. \n\nCompliance risk arises from violations of, or failure to conform or comply with, laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and ethical standards. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks. Operational and compliance failures, deficiencies in our control environment or an inability to maintain an ethical workplace and high standards of business conduct can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations. \n\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected. \n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or \n\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages. \n\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities. \n\nNew tax legislation could be enacted in the countries in which we have operations. For example, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) would impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD&#8217;s guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent could impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. A number of countries, including the Member States in the EU, have adopted, or plan to adopt, these minimum tax guidelines starting in 2024, which we expect would impact our effective tax rate when the rules become effective. In addition to legislative changes, actions by tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. \n\nCredit, Liquidity and Market Risks \n\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective. \n\nOur risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or develop in the future, that we have not appropriately identified or mitigated. As regulations, technology and competition continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. \n\nManagement of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For example, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of certain financial instruments, not only based on historical experience and current conditions, but also by including forecasts incorporating forward-looking information. If our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. \n\nWe are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables, and institutional credit risk, principally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. General economic factors, such as gross domestic product, unemployment, inflation and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. A customer&#8217;s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions but also by a customer&#8217;s other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us. \n\nWe rely principally on the customer&#8217;s creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. This may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decisions does not accurately portray a customer's creditworthiness, including as a result of the \n\ncurrent high rates of inflation and economic slowdown. Further, our pricing strategies, particularly for new lending features and non-card lending products, may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. \n\nWe have experienced higher delinquency and write-off rates for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and such rates are expected to continue to increase. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses. Higher write-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds. \n\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States where, for example, U.S. Card Members were responsible for approximately 87 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nInterest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings. \n\nOur interest expense was approximately $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of approximately $141 million. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change as benchmark interest rates change. For example, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have recently raised interest rates in response to heightened inflationary pressures. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see &#8220;Risk Management &#8213; Market Risk Management Process&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; \n\nAdverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs. \n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; under &#8220;MD&#38;A.&#8221; \n\nAny reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets. \n\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital. \n\nDuring 2022, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nForeign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them. Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment to us by the local card issuer for obligations arising out of local Card Members&#8217; spending outside \n\nsuch country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members&#8217; currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations. \n\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business. \n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. \n\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB&#8217;s capital levels. The FDIA&#8217;s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business. \n\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions. \n\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately $4.6 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us. \n\n"

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&#38;A) \n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW \n\nBUSINESS INTRODUCTION \n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nOur range of products and services includes: \n\n&#8226; Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products \n\n&#8226; Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants \n\n&#8226; Network services \n\n&#8226; Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs \n\n&#8226; Expense management products and services \n\n&#8226; Travel and lifestyle services \n\nOur various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. \n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: \n\n&#8226; Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant&#8217;s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for &#8220;non-swiped&#8221; card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States; \n\n&#8226; Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances; \n\n&#8226; Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account; \n\n&#8226; Service fees and other revenue, primarily represent service fees earned from merchants and other customers, travel commissions and fees, Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency-related fees charged to Card Members, and income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence; and \n\n&#8226; Processed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. \n\nRefer to the &#8220;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#8221; for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this Form 10-K. \n\nNON-GAAP MEASURES \n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. \n\nTABLE 1: SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages, per share amounts and where indicated) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nSelected Income Statement Data Total revenues net of interest expense $ 52,862 $ 42,380 $ 36,087 $ 10,482 25 % $ 6,293 17 % \n\nProvisions for credit losses \n\n2,182 (1,419) 4,730 3,601 # (6,149) # Expenses 41,095 33,110 27,061 7,985 24 6,049 22 Pretax income 9,585 10,689 4,296 (1,104) (10) 6,393 # Income tax provision 2,071 2,629 1,161 (558) (21) 1,468 # Net income 7,514 8,060 3,135 (546) (7) 4,925 # \n\nEarnings per common share &#8212; diluted (a) \n\n$ 9.85 $ 10.02 $ 3.77 $ (0.17) (2) % $ 6.25 # % \n\nCommon Share Statistics (b) \n\nCash dividends declared per common share $ 2.08 $ 1.72 $ 1.72 $ 0.36 21 % $ &#8212; &#8212; % Average common shares outstanding: Basic 751 789 805 (38) (5) % (16) (2) % Diluted 752 790 806 (38) (5) % (16) (2) % Selected Metrics and Ratios \n\nNetwork volumes (Billions) \n\n$ 1,552.8 $ 1,284.2 $ 1,037.8 $ 269 21 % $ 246 24 % \n\nReturn on average equity (c) \n\n32.3 &#160; % 33.7 % 14.2 % Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans 10.4 &#160; % 10.2 % 10.7 % \n\nNet interest yield on average Card Member loans (d) \n\n10.6 &#160; % 10.7 % 11.5 % Effective tax rate 21.6 &#160; % 24.6 % 27.0 % Common Equity Tier 1 10.3 &#160; % 10.5 % 13.5 % Selected Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 33,914 $ 22,028 $ 32,965 $ 11,886 54 % $ (10,937) (33) % Card Member receivables 57,613 53,645 43,701 3,968 7 9,944 23 Card Member loans 107,964 88,562 73,373 19,402 22 15,189 21 Customer deposits 110,239 84,382 86,875 25,857 31 (2,493) (3) Long-term debt $ 42,573 $ 38,675 $ 42,952 $ 3,898 10 % $ (4,277) (10) % # Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents net income, less (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $57 million, $56 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $57 million, $71 million and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and (iii) equity-related adjustments of $16 million related to the redemption of preferred shares for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Table 8 for a reconciliation to Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans. \n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT \n\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic. Spending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance. \n\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year. \n\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ). Billed business, which represented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed business grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business in our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise customers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent year-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&#38;E spending momentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods &#38; Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the large pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our international billings. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased 36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by growth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a modest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year. \n\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased versus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in 2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year. \n\n1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over year due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy. \n\nDuring the year, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, while maintaining our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. We also expect to increase the regular quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding by 15 percent beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. \n\nOur performance continues to give us confidence in our business model and our strategy, and while we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on delivering sustainable and profitable growth. \n\nSee &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; in &#8220;Business&#8221; for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; for information on potential impacts of economic, geopolitical and competitive conditions and certain litigation and regulatory matters on our business. \n\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe discussions in the &#8220;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Business Segment Results of Operations&#8221; provide commentary on the variances for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as presented in the accompanying tables. For a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7. &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022. \n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, we made reporting presentation changes to our Consolidated Statements of Income to separately present revenues earned from processed volumes, previously reported in Discount revenue, Other fees and commissions and Other revenue, as Processed revenue. The remaining balances from Other fees and commissions and Other revenue were combined as Service fees and other revenue. We also disaggregated Marketing and business development expense into Business Development expense and Marketing expense. Prior period amounts presented herein have been recast to conform to the current period presentation; there was no impact to Total non-interest revenues or Total expenses. \n\nTABLE 2: TOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE SUMMARY ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nDiscount revenue $ 30,739 &#160; $ 24,563 $ 19,435 $ 6,176 25 % $ 5,128 26 % Net card fees 6,070 &#160; 5,195 4,664 875 17 531 11 Service fees and other revenue 4,521 &#160; 3,316 2,702 1,205 36 614 23 Processed revenue 1,637 &#160; 1,556 1,301 81 5 255 20 Total non-interest revenues 42,967 &#160; 34,630 28,102 8,337 24 6,528 23 Total interest income 12,658 &#160; 9,033 10,083 3,625 40 (1,050) (10) Total interest expense 2,763 &#160; 1,283 2,098 1,480 # (815) (39) Net interest income 9,895 &#160; 7,750 7,985 2,145 28 (235) (3) Total revenues net of interest expense $ 52,862 &#160; $ 42,380 $ 36,087 $ 10,482 25 % $ 6,293 17 % # Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more ##TABLE_END\n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nDiscount revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in billed business of 23 percent. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. \n\nNet card fees increased, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. \n\nService fees and other revenue increased, primarily driven by foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending, higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business, and growth in delinquency fees. The increase was partially offset by a non-cash gain related to an increase in GBTG's total equity book value in the prior year. \n\nProcessed revenue increased, primarily driven by an increase in processed volumes, partially offset by the prior-year repositioning of certain of our alternative payment solutions. \n\nInterest income increased, primarily driven by higher average Card Member loan balances and interest rates. \n\nInterest expense increased, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on deposits and debt outstanding. \n\nTABLE 3: PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES SUMMARY ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nCard Member loans Net write-offs $ 1,066 &#160; $ 879 $ 2,170 $ 187 21 % $ (1,291) (59) % Reserve build (release) (a) \n\n448 &#160; (2,034) 1,283 2,482 # (3,317) # Total 1,514 &#160; (1,155) 3,453 2,669 # (4,608) # Card Member receivables Net write-offs 462 &#160; 129 881 333 # (752) (85) Reserve build (release) (a) \n\n165 &#160; (202) 134 367 # (336) # Total 627 &#160; (73) 1,015 700 # (1,088) # Other Net write-offs &#8212; Other loans (b) \n\n22 &#160; 21 111 1 5 (90) (81) Net write-offs &#8212; Other receivables (c) \n\n15 &#160; 33 27 (18) (55) 6 22 Reserve build (release) &#8212; Other loans (a)(b) \n\n7 &#160; (185) 66 192 # (251) # Reserve (release) build &#8212; Other receivables (a)(c) \n\n(3) (60) 58 57 95 (118) # Total 41 &#160; (191) 262 232 # (453) # \n\nTotal provisions for credit losses \n\n$ 2,182 &#160; $ (1,419) $ 4,730 $ 3,601 # % $ (6,149) # % # Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Refer to the &#8220;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#8221; for a definition of reserve build (release). \n\n(b) Relates to Other loans of $5.4 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion less reserves of $59 million, $52 million and $238 million, as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(c) Relates to Other receivables included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $3.1 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion, less reserves of $22 million, $25 million and $85 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n\nCard Member loans and receivables provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to reserve builds in the current year, versus reserve releases in the prior year. The reserve builds in the current year were primarily driven by increases in loans and receivables outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves for Card Member loans. The reserve releases in the prior year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by increases in loans and receivables outstanding. \n\nOther provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to a net reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in the prior year. The net reserve build in the current year was primarily driven by increases in non-card loans outstanding, partially offset by improved credit performance. The reserve release in the prior year was due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts. \n\nRefer to Note 3 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for further information regarding our reserves for credit losses. \n\nTABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nCard Member rewards \n\n$ 14,002 &#160; $ 11,007 $ 8,041 $ 2,995 27 % $ 2,966 37 % Business development 4,943 &#160; 3,762 3,051 1,181 31 711 23 Card Member services 2,959 &#160; 1,993 1,230 966 48 763 62 Marketing 5,458 &#160; 5,291 3,696 167 3 1,595 43 Salaries and employee benefits 7,252 &#160; 6,240 5,718 1,012 16 522 9 \n\nOther, net \n\n6,481 &#160; 4,817 5,325 1,664 35 (508) (10) Total expenses $ 41,095 &#160; $ 33,110 $ 27,061 $ 7,985 24 % $ 6,049 22 % ##TABLE_END\n\nEXPENSES \n\nCard Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses, collectively, of $2.0 billion, and cobrand rewards expense of $1.0 billion, both of which were primarily driven by higher billed business. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. \n\nThe Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nBusiness development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes. \n\nCard Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. \n\nMarketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth as well as compensation decisions made. \n\nOther expenses increased, primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year. \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nThe effective tax rate was 21.6 percent and 24.6 percent for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate primarily reflected discrete tax benefits in the current year related to the resolution of prior-year tax items. The tax rates in both years reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. \n\nTABLE 5: SELECTED CARD-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_START Change Change Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nNetwork volumes (billions) \n\n$ 1,552.8 $ 1,284.2 $ 1,037.8 21 % 24 % Billed business $ 1,338.3 $ 1,089.8 $ 870.7 23 25 Processed volumes $ 214.5 $ 194.4 $ 167.1 10 16 \n\nCards-in-force (millions) \n\n133.3 121.7 112.0 10 9 Proprietary cards-in-force 76.7 71.4 68.9 7 4 \n\nBasic cards-in-force (millions) \n\n111.5 100.7 91.3 11 10 Proprietary basic cards-in-force 59.1 54.7 52.7 8 4 \n\nAverage proprietary basic Card Member spending (dollars) \n\n$ 23,496 $ 20,392 $ 16,352 15 25 \n\nAverage discount rate \n\n2.34 &#160; % 2.30 % 2.28 % \n\nAverage fee per card (dollars) (a) \n\n$ 82 $ 74 $ 67 11 % 10 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Average fee per card is computed on an annualized basis based on proprietary Net card fees divided by average proprietary total cards-in-force. \n\nTABLE 6: NETWORK VOLUMES-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Year over Year Percentage Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Assuming No Changes in FX Rates (a) \n\nYear over Year Percentage Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) \n\nAssuming No Changes in FX Rates (a) \n\nNetwork volumes 21 &#160; % 24 &#160; % 24 % 23 % Total billed business 23 &#160; 25 &#160; 25 24 U.S. Consumer Services 24 &#160; 32 Commercial Services 21 &#160; 22 &#160; 21 20 International Card Services 23 &#160; 36 &#160; 22 18 Processed volumes 10 &#160; 18 &#160; 16 14 Merchant industry billed business metrics G&#38;S-related (75% and 81% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively) \n\n13 &#160; 16 &#160; 19 18 T&#38;E-related (25% and 19% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively) \n\n64 &#160; 67 &#160; 59 58 Airline-related (6% and 3% of billed business for 2022 and 2021, respectively) \n\n119 &#160; % 125 &#160; % 63 % 61 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding prior-year period against which such results are being compared). \n\nTABLE 7: SELECTED CREDIT-RELATED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_START As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nCard Member loans: \n\nCard Member loans (billions) \n\n$ 108.0 &#160; $ 88.6 $ 73.4 22 % 21 % Credit loss reserves: Beginning balance $ 3,305 &#160; $ 5,344 $ 4,027 (38) 33 Provisions &#8212; principal, interest and fees 1,514 &#160; (1,155) 3,453 # # Net write-offs &#8212; principal less recoveries (837) (672) (1,795) 25 (63) Net write-offs &#8212; interest and fees less recoveries (229) (207) (375) 11 (45) Other (a) \n\n(6) (5) 34 (20) # Ending balance $ 3,747 &#160; $ 3,305 $ 5,344 13 (38) % of loans 3.5 &#160; % 3.7 % 7.3 % % of past due 348 &#160; % 555 % 727 % \n\nAverage loans (billions) \n\n$ 95.4 &#160; $ 76.1 $ 74.6 25 2 \n\nNet write-off rate &#8212; principal, interest and fees (b) \n\n1.1 &#160; % 1.2 % 2.9 % \n\nNet write-off rate &#8212; principal only (b) \n\n0.9 &#160; % 0.9 % 2.4 % \n\n30+ days past due as a % of total \n\n1.0 &#160; % 0.7 % 1.0 % Card Member receivables: \n\nCard Member receivables (billions) \n\n$ 57.6 &#160; $ 53.6 $ 43.7 7 23 Credit loss reserves: Beginning balance $ 64 &#160; $ 267 $ 126 (76) # Provisions &#8212; principal and fees \n\n627 &#160; (73) 1,015 # # Net write-offs &#8212; principal and fees less recoveries (c) \n\n(462) (129) (881) # (85) Other (a) \n\n&#8212; &#160; (1) 7 # # Ending balance $ 229 &#160; $ 64 $ 267 # % (76) % % of receivables 0.4 &#160; % 0.1 % 0.6 % \n\nNet write-off rate &#8212; principal and fees (b)(c)(d) \n\n0.8 &#160; % 0.3 % 2.0 % \n\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Other includes foreign currency translation adjustments. \n\n(b) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention.

Refer to &#8220;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#8221; for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans. \n\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States) and regulatory considerations. Refer to Note 24 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; and Part I, Item 1. &#8220;Business&#8221; for additional discussion of products and services that comprise each segment. \n\nEffective for the third quarter of 2022, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2022. Prior periods presented herein have been recast to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are: USCS, CS, ICS and GMNS, with corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations included in Corporate &#38; Other. Refer to Note 24 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information. \n\nResults of the reportable operating segments generally treat each segment as a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives these results allocates revenue and expense using various methodologies as described below. \n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, CS and ICS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment&#8217;s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue being allocated. \n\nNet card fees, processed revenue and certain other revenues are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. \n\nInterest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n\nThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nCard Member rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Business development and Marketing expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs, which primarily reflect salaries and benefits associated with our technology and customer servicing groups, and overhead expenses. Service costs are allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses are allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables. \n\nU.S. CONSUMER SERVICES \n\nTABLE 9: USCS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nRevenues Non-interest revenues $ 16,440 &#160; $ 12,989 $ 10,125 $ 3,451 27 % $ 2,864 28 % Interest income 8,457 &#160; 6,328 7,009 2,129 34 (681) (10) Interest expense 983 &#160; 395 787 588 # (392) (50) Net interest income 7,474 &#160; 5,933 6,222 1,541 26 (289) (5) Total revenues net of interest expense 23,914 &#160; 18,922 16,347 4,992 26 2,575 16 Provisions for credit losses 1,021 &#160; (919) 2,617 1,940 # (3,536) # Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses 22,893 &#160; 19,841 13,730 3,052 15 6,111 45 Total expenses 17,493 &#160; 13,883 10,627 3,610 26 3,256 31 Pretax segment income $ 5,400 &#160; $ 5,958 $ 3,103 $ (558) (9) % $ 2,855 92 % \n\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nUSCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products. \n\nTOTAL REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE \n\nNon-interest revenues increased across all revenue categories, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue and Net card fees. \n\nDiscount revenue increased 25 percent, primarily driven by an increase in U.S. consumer billed business of 24 percent. See Tables 5, 6 and 10 for more details on billed business performance. \n\nNet card fees increased 24 percent, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. \n\nService fees and other revenue increased 50 percent, primarily driven by higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business, as well as growth in delinquency fees. \n\nNet interest income increased 26 percent, primarily driven by an increase in average Card Member loan balances. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue, reflecting billed business growth, partially offset by decreased Net interest income, primarily reflecting lower revolving Card Member loan balances. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n\nCard Member loans and receivables provisions for credit losses increased, primarily due to reserve builds in the current year, versus reserve releases in the prior year. The reserve builds in the current year were primarily driven by an increase in loans outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves for Card Member loans. The reserve releases in the prior year were due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by increases in loans and receivables outstanding. \n\nProvisions for credit losses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by reserve releases in 2021, versus reserve builds in 2020. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nTotal expenses increased, primarily driven by higher Card Member rewards expense and Card Member services expense. \n\nCard Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by higher billed business and a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. \n\nBusiness development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments driven by higher billed business. \n\nCard Member services expense increased, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. \n\nMarketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased, primarily due to higher compensation costs and higher service costs. \n\nTotal expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher customer engagement and marketing expenses, reflecting higher billed business and increases in marketing investments to continue building growth momentum. \n\nTABLE 10: USCS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_START As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nBilled business (billions) \n\n$ 553.0 $ 444.2 $ 337.6 24 % 32 % Proprietary cards-in-force 41.7 39.0 37.7 7 3 Proprietary basic cards-in-force 29.2 27.3 26.6 7 3 \n\nAverage proprietary basic Card Member spending (dollars) \n\n$ 19,514 $ 16,498 $ 12,641 18 31 \n\nTotal segment assets (billions) \n\n$ 94.4 $ 76.5 $ 65.0 23 18 Card Member loans: Total loans (billions) \n\n$ 72.7 $ 59.8 $ 51.4 22 16 Average loans (billions) \n\n$ 63.7 $ 52.0 $ 53.0 23 (2) Net write-off rate &#8212; principal, interest and fees (a) \n\n1.1 &#160; % 1.1 % 2.9 % Net write-off rate &#8212; principal only (a) \n\n0.9 &#160; % 0.8 % 2.4 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 1.0 &#160; % 0.7 % 1.0 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans: Net interest income \n\n$ 7,474 $ 5,933 $ 6,222 Exclude: \n\nInterest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b) \n\n139 158 288 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (c) \n\n(228) (110) (189) Adjusted net interest income (d) \n\n$ 7,385 $ 5,981 $ 6,321 Average Card Member loans (billions) \n\n$ 63.7 $ 52.0 $ 53.0 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (d) \n\n11.7 &#160; % 11.4 % 11.7 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (d) \n\n11.6 &#160; % 11.5 % 11.9 % Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) \n\n$ 14.3 $ 14.7 $ 11.9 (3) % 24 % Net write-off rate &#8212; principal and fees (a) \n\n0.6 &#160; % 0.1 % 1.4 % Net write-off rate &#8212; principal only (a) \n\n0.6 &#160; % &#8212; % 1.3 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 0.9 &#160; % 0.4 % 0.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Refer to Table 7 footnote (b). \n\n(b) Refer to Table 8 footnote (a). \n\n(c) Refer to Table 8 footnote (b). \n\n(d) Refer to Table 8 footnote (c). \n\nCOMMERCIAL SERVICES \n\nTABLE 11: CS SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA ##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nRevenues Non-interest revenues $ 12,196 &#160; $ 9,833 $ 8,210 $ 2,363 24 % $ 1,623 20 % Interest income 2,070 &#160; 1,408 1,532 662 47 (124) (8) Interest expense 697 &#160; 330 508 367 # (178) (35) Net interest income 1,373 &#160; 1,078 1,024 295 27 54 5 Total revenues net of interest expense 13,569 &#160; 10,911 9,234 2,658 24 1,677 18 Provisions for credit losses 565 &#160; (420) 1,291 985 # (1,711) # Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses 13,004 &#160; 11,331 7,943 1,673 15 3,388 43 Total expenses 10,124 &#160; 8,395 6,930 1,729 21 1,465 21 Pretax segment income $ 2,880 &#160; $ 2,936 $ 1,013 $ (56) (2) % $ 1,923 # % \n\n# Denotes a variance of 100 percent or more \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCS issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides services to U.S. businesses, including payment and expense management, banking and non-card financing products.

See Tables 5, 6 and 12 for more details on billed business performance. \n\nNet card fees increased 22 percent, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. \n\nService fees and other revenue increased 60 percent, primarily due to higher foreign exchange related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending and higher delinquency fees. \n\nProcessed revenue decreased 71 percent, primarily driven by the prior-year repositioning of certain of our alternative payment solutions. \n\nNet interest income increased 27 percent, primarily driven by higher revolving Card Member loan balances. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by increased Discount revenue, reflecting billed business growth, and increased Net interest income, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds, partially offset by lower revolving Card Member loan balances. \n\nPROVISIONS FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n\nCard Member loans provision for credit losses increased, primarily due to a reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in the prior year. The reserve build in the current year was primarily driven by an increase in loans outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves. The reserve release in the prior year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding. \n\nCard Member receivables provision for credit losses increased, primarily due to a reserve build in the current year, versus a reserve release in the prior year, and higher net write-offs in the current year. The reserve build in the current year was primarily driven by higher delinquencies and an increase in receivables outstanding. The reserve release in the prior year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by an increase in receivables outstanding. \n\nProvisions for credit losses decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by reserve releases in 2021, versus reserve builds in 2020. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nTotal expenses increased, primarily driven by Card Member rewards expense and Business development expense. \n\nCard Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by higher billed business as well as a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. \n\nBusiness development expense increased, primarily due to increased client incentive payments driven by higher billed business. \n\nCard Member services expense increased, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. \n\nMarketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased, primarily due to higher compensation costs and higher service costs. \n\nTotal expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher customer engagement and marketing expenses, reflecting higher billed business and increases in marketing investments to continue building growth momentum. \n\nTABLE 12: CS SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION ##TABLE_START As of or for the Years Ended December 31, Change Change (Millions, except percentages and where indicated) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 \n\n2021 vs. 2020 \n\nBilled business (billions) \n\n$ 499.5 $ 411.6 $ 340.0 21 % 21 % Proprietary cards-in-force 14.9 13.4 12.5 11 7 \n\nAverage Card Member spending (dollars) \n\n$ 35,202 $ 32,042 $ 27,045 10 18 \n\nTotal segment assets (billions) \n\n$ 51.4 $ 44.5 $ 34.9 16 28 \n\nCard Member loans: \n\nTotal loans (billions) \n\n$ 21.4 $ 17.0 $ 12.8 26 33 Average loans (billions) \n\n$ 19.3 $ 14.4 $ 12.5 34 15 Net write-off rate &#8212; principal, interest and fees (a) \n\n0.8 &#160; % 0.8 % 2.4 % Net write-off rate &#8212; principal only (a) \n\n0.7 &#160; % 0.6 % 2.1 % 30+ days past due as a % of total 0.9 &#160; % 0.5 % 0.7 % Calculation of Net Interest Yield on Average Card Member Loans: Net interest income $ 1,373 $ 1,078 $ 1,024 Exclude: Interest expense not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (b) \n\n430 251 377 Interest income not attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio (c) \n\n(89) (76) (166) Adjusted net interest income (d) \n\n$ 1,714 $ 1,253 $ 1,235 Average Card Member loans &#160;(billions) \n\n$ 19.3 $ 14.4 $ 12.5 Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans (d) \n\n7.1 &#160; % 7.5 % 8.2 % Net interest yield on average Card Member loans (d) \n\n8.9 &#160; % 8.7 % 9.9 % Card Member receivables: Total receivables (billions) \n\n$ 26.9 $ 24.6 $ 19.1 9 % 29 % Net write-off rate &#8212; principal and fees (e) \n\n0.7 &#160; % 0.2 % 1.8 % Net write-off rate &#8212; principal only (a) - small business \n\n0.9 &#160; % 0.2 % 2.2 % 30+ days past due as a % of total - small business \n\n1.6 &#160; % 0.8 % 0.7 % 90+ days past billing as a % of total (e) - corporate \n\n0.6 &#160; % 0.3 % 0.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Refer to Table 7 footnote (b). \n\n(b) Refer to Table 8 footnote (a). \n\n(c) Refer to Table 8 footnote (b). \n\n(d) Refer to Table 8 footnote (c). \n\n(e) For corporate receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due.

See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. \n\nService fees and other revenue increased 28 percent, primarily due to higher foreign currency-related revenue. \n\nProcessed revenue increased 14 percent, primarily driven by higher processed volumes. \n\nGMNS receives an interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing due to its merchant payables. Net interest income increased, primarily due to a higher interest expense credit, largely driven by an increase in average merchant payables related to billed business growth and higher interest rates. \n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue, reflecting higher billed business, and increased Net interest income, primarily due to a higher interest expense credit, reflecting an increase in average merchant payables related to year-over-year billed business growth. \n\nEXPENSES \n\nTotal expenses increased, primarily driven by higher Salaries and employee benefits expense, reflecting higher compensation costs, as well as higher Business development expense, primarily resulting from increased partner payments driven by higher network volumes. \n\nTotal expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by higher Business development and Marketing expenses, reflecting increased partner payments, driven by higher network volumes, as well as increased spend on initiatives to support merchant engagement. \n\nCORPORATE &#38; OTHER \n\nCorporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nCorporate &#38; Other pretax loss was $2.2 billion and $1.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the pretax loss was primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year, a non-cash gain in the prior year related to an increase in GBTG's total equity book value and higher compensation costs in the current year. \n\nCONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY \n\nOur balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: \n\n&#8226; A solid and flexible equity capital profile; \n\n&#8226; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and \n\n&#8226; Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. \n\nWe continue to see volatility in the capital markets due to a variety of factors and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances. \n\nCAPITAL STRATEGY \n\nWe believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See &#8220;Dividends and Share Repurchases&#8221; below. \n\nThe level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, which takes into account our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. Failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at American Express or our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the banking regulators with oversight of American Express or AENB to take actions that could limit our business operations. \n\nWe seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio. \n\nWe maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or at our subsidiaries. \n\nWe report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. \n\nThe following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of AENB, as of December 31, 2022: \n\nTABLE 16: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS ##TABLE_START Effective Minimum (a) \n\nRatios as of December 31, 2022 \n\nRisk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 7.0 % American Express Company 10.3 % American Express National Bank 11.3 Tier 1 8.5 American Express Company 11.1 American Express National Bank 11.3 Total 10.5 American Express Company 12.8 American Express National Bank 13.2 Tier 1 Leverage 4.0 % American Express Company 9.9 American Express National Bank 9.7 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents Basel III minimum requirements and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer (SCB) for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for AENB. Refer to &#8220;Capital and Liquidity Regulation&#8221; under &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and Note 22 to our &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information. \n\nThe following table presents American Express Company's regulatory risk-based capital and risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2022: \n\nTABLE 17: REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL COMPONENTS AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS ##TABLE_START \n\nAmerican Express Company \n\n($ in Billions) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nRisk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 $ 20.0 Tier 1 Capital 21.6 Tier 2 Capital \n\n3.3 Total Capital 24.9 Risk-Weighted Assets 194.4 Average Total Assets to calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio $ 218.6 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: \n\nRisk-Weighted Assets &#8212; Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. \n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders&#8217; equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below. \n\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as Tier 1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. See Note 16 to the \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" for additional information on our preferred shares. \n\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets), and $870 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $870 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $120 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014. \n\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio &#8212; Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. \n\nWe elected to delay the recognition of $0.7 billion of impact to regulatory capital from the adoption of the CECL methodology for two years, followed by a three-year phase-in period at 25 percent once per year beginning January 1, 2022, pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of January 1, 2023, we have phased in 50 percent of such amount. Refer to &#8220;Capital and Liquidity Regulation&#8221; under Part 1, Item 1. &#8220;Business - Supervision and Regulation&#8221; for additional details. \n\nAs a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2022. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2022. \n\nDIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES \n\nWe return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we returned $4.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $1.6 billion and share repurchases of $3.3 billion. We repurchased 20 million common shares at an average price of $168.14 in 2022. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 64 percent of total capital generated during the year. \n\nWe plan to increase the regular quarterly dividend on our common shares outstanding by approximately 15 percent, from 52 cents to 60 cents per share, beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. \n\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $57 million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. Refer to Note 16 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information on our preferred shares. \n\nOur decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors, including: our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements; regulatory guidance or restrictions, actual and forecasted business results; economic and market conditions; revisions to, or revocation of, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s authorization of our capital plan; and the supervisory stress test process. We may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) or other purchases, including block trades, accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate. \n\nFUNDING STRATEGY \n\nOur principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile. Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability management activities. We have in place a funding policy covering American Express Company and all of our subsidiaries. \n\nOur global proprietary card-issuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international Card Member lending and receivable activities. Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing businesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition, we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities. \n\nWe aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits, unsecured debt and asset securitizations, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. \n\nWe expect the balance of our direct deposits to continue to grow. Our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth, our liquidity position, and choice of funding sources, as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers, the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments. In executing our funding plan, we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term refinancing requirements. \n\nFUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES \n\nWe had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of December 31: \n\nTABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT ##TABLE_START (Billions) 2022 2021 Customer deposits $ 110.2 &#160; $ 84.4 Short-term borrowings 1.3 &#160; 2.2 Long-term debt 42.6 &#160; 38.7 Total customer deposits and debt $ 154.1 &#160; $ 125.3 ##TABLE_END\n\nWe may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities. \n\nOur funding plan for the full year 2023 includes, among other sources, approximately $6.0 billion to $10.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5.0 billion to $9.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. \n\nOur equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody&#8217;s Investor Services (Moody&#8217;s), Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (S&#38;P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. \n\nTABLE 19: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS ##TABLE_START American Express Entity Moody's S&#38;P Fitch American Express Company Long Term A2 BBB+ A Short Term N/A A-2 F1 Outlook Stable Stable Stable American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.

Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. \n\nDEPOSIT PROGRAMS \n\nWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. &#160; AENB also offers checking account products and sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2022, we had $110.2 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits. \n\nSHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS \n\nShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. &#160; We had no commercial paper outstanding at any point during 2022. Refer to Note 8 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a further description of these borrowings. \n\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $42.6 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations. \n\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a further description of our asset securitizations. \n\nTABLE 20: DEBT ISSUANCES ##TABLE_START (Billions) 2022 American Express Company: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon rate of 3.60%) $ 10.2 Floating Rate Senior Notes (compounded SOFR (a) plus weighted-average spread of 83 basis points) \n\n1.0 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes (4.42% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR (a) plus 1.76% during the floating rate period) \n\n1.2 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (4.989% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR (a) \n\nplus 2.255% during the floating rate period) \n\n0.8 American Express Credit Account Master Trust: Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 3.51%) \n\n7.3 Total $ 20.5 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). \n\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT \n\nOur liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. \n\nOur liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#8226; Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the &#8220;Funding Strategy&#8221; section for more details); \n\n&#8226; Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; \n\n&#8226; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and \n\n&#8226; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements. \n\nWe seek to maintain access to a diverse set of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity sources, including cash and other liquid assets, committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities. Through our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, we also hold collateral eligible for use at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window. \n\nThe amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. These stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics, varying by cash flow assumptions, time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources, among other factors. Scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include market-wide, firm-specific and combined liquidity stresses. We consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements. \n\nThe investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. The level of future net interest income or costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. \n\nSecuritized Borrowing Capacity \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of September 16, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or the Lending Trust facility. \n\nFederal Reserve Discount Window \n\nAs an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $102.8 billion in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. \n\nCommitted Bank Credit Facility \n\nIn addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, as of December 31, 2022 we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $3.5 billion with a maturity date of October 15, 2024. The availability of the credit facility is subject to our maintenance of a minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent, with certain restrictions in relation to either accessing the facility or distributing capital to common shareholders in the event our CET1 risk-based capital ratio falls between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent. It does not contain a material adverse change clause, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the facility, nor is it dependent on our credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility and no amounts were drawn on the facility. We use this facility from time to time in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. Any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding. \n\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe have certain off-balance sheet obligations that include guarantees, indemnifications and certain Card Member and partner arrangements that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and capital resources. For more information on these obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 15 and Note 23 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nCASH FLOWS \n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021: \n\nTABLE 21: CASH FLOWS ##TABLE_START (Billions) 2022 2021 2020 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 21.1 &#160; $ 14.6 $ 5.6 Investing activities (33.7) (10.5) 11.6 Financing activities 24.5 &#160; (14.9) (9.1) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents &#8212; &#160; (0.1) 0.4 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 11.9 &#160; $ (10.9) $ 8.5 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nOur cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and other non-cash items and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. \n\nIn 2022, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in Membership Rewards liability related to growth in billed business. \n\nIn 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, resulting from an increase in Membership Rewards liability and higher accounts payable to merchants related to growth in billed business. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nOur cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. \n\nIn 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending and net purchases of investment securities. \n\nIn 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loan and receivable balances, resulting from higher Card Member spending, partially offset by net maturities of our investment securities. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nOur cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases. \n\nIn 2022, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and net proceeds from debt, partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments. \n\nIn 2021, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by share repurchases, net debt repayments, decreases in customer deposits, dividends and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT \n\nGOVERNANCE \n\nWe use our comprehensive Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) program to identify, aggregate, monitor, measure, report and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer. \n\nRisk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through three Board committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, risk profile and performance, controls, talent and capabilities. The Board monitors the &#8220;tone at the top,&#8221; our risk culture, and oversees emerging and strategic risks. \n\nThe Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM framework, processes and methodologies. The Risk Committee approves our ERM policy. The ERM policy governs risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite, including credit risk (at both the individual and institutional levels), operational risk (e.g., operations, legal, conduct, third-party, information technology, information security, data management, privacy and people risks), compliance risk, reputational risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, model risk, strategic and business risk, country risk and environmental, social and governance risk. Risk appetite defines the authorized risk limits to control exposures within our risk capacity and risk tolerance, including stressed forward-looking scenarios. In addition, it establishes principles for risk taking in the aggregate and for each risk type, and is supported by a comprehensive system for monitoring performance (including limits and escalation triggers) and assessing control programs. \n\nThe Risk Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Risk Officer and receives regular updates from the Chief Risk Officer on key risks and exposures. \n\nThe Risk Committee reviews our risk profile against the tolerances specified in the Risk Appetite Framework, including significant risk exposures, risk trends in our portfolios and major risk concentrations. \n\nThe Risk Committee also provides oversight of our compliance with Regulatory capital and liquidity standards, and our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, including the CCAR submissions. \n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves compliance policies, which include our Compliance Risk Tolerance Statement. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of our Corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. More broadly, this committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, internal and external auditing, including the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit services function, and the integrity of our systems of internal controls. \n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee provides oversight of our Internal Audit Group. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and concurs with the appointment, replacement, performance and compensation of our Chief Audit Executive, who reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and approves Internal Audit&#8217;s annual audit plan, charter, policies, budget and staffing levels, and overall risk assessment methodology. The Audit and Compliance Committee also receives regular updates on the audit plan&#8217;s status and results, including significant reports issued by Internal Audit and the status of our corrective actions. \n\nThe Compensation and Benefits Committee of our Board of Directors works with the Chief Risk Officer to ensure our overall compensation programs, as well as those covering our risk-taking employees, appropriately balance risk with business incentives and that business performance is achieved without taking imprudent or excessive risk. Our Chief Risk Officer is actively involved in setting risk goals for the Company. Our Chief Risk Officer also reviews the risk profiles of each business unit and provides input into performance evaluation. The Chief Risk Officer meets with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and attests whether performance goals and results have been achieved without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation and Benefits Committee uses a risk-balanced incentive compensation framework to decide on our bonus pools and the compensation of senior executives. \n\nThere are several internal management committees, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks. In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk and asset/liability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. \n\nAs defined in the ERM policy, we follow the &#8220;three lines of defense&#8221; approach to risk management. The first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking. The Chief Executive Officer, business unit presidents and the Chief Financial Officer are part of the first line of defense. The second line comprises independent functions overseeing risk-taking activities of the first line. The Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer, the Chief Operational Risk Officer and certain control groups, both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities, are part of the second line of defense. The global risk oversight team oversees the policies, strategies, frameworks, models, processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks. Our Internal Audit Group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense. \n\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define credit risk as loss due to default or changes in the credit quality of a customer, obligor or security. Our credit risks are divided into two broad categories: individual and institutional. Each has distinct risk management capabilities, strategies, and tools. Business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams, each led by a Chief Credit Officer. \n\nIndividual Credit Risk \n\nIndividual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards, credit cards, and term loans. These portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies, industries and levels of net worth. We benefit from the high-quality profile of our customers, which is driven by our brand, premium customer servicing, product features and risk management capabilities, which span underwriting, customer management and collections. The risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. \n\nThe business unit leaders and their Chief Credit Officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process. These Chief Credit Officers are guided by the Individual Credit Risk Committee (ICRC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Individual Credit Risk Management Policy. The ICRC ensures compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ERMC as appropriate. \n\nCredit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision-making models that use up-to-date information on prospects and customers, such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus. We have developed data-driven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers. \n\nInstitutional Credit Risk \n\nInstitutional credit risk arises principally within our CS, ICS and GMNS businesses, as well as investment and liquidity management activities. Unlike individual credit risk, institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity. It is affected both by general economic conditions and by client-specific events. The absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios, given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios. \n\nSimilar to individual credit risk, business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by Chief Credit Officers. These officers are guided by the Institutional Risk Management Committee (IRMC), which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Institutional Credit Risk Management Policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures. The committee, along with the business unit Chief Credit Officers, makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities, ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation, monitors risk exposures, and determines risk mitigation actions. The IRMC formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ERMC guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ERMC as appropriate. At the same time, the IRMC provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. A centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors. \n\nExposure to the Airline and Travel Industry \n\nWe have multiple important cobrand, rewards, merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines. The ERM program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy company-wide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines, and the travel industry more broadly, including cruise lines, travel agencies and tour operators. Our largest airline partner is Delta, and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including Membership Rewards redemption, merchant acceptance, travel and corporate payments. See &#8220; We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations &#8221; and &#8220;Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings and consolidations, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners &#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information. \n\nDebt Exposure \n\nAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign customers and counterparties, and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions, as well as by economic sectors and industries. A primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles. We evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk. As of December 31, 2022, we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities, financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss, brand damage, customer dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory penalties. \n\nTo appropriately measure and manage operational risk, we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the Operational Risk Management Policy approved by the ERMC. The Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by the Chief Operational Risk Officer, coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls. It also oversees the preventive, responsive and mitigation efforts by Operational Excellence teams in the business units and staff groups. \n\nWe use the operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks. This framework, supervised by the ORMC, consists of (a) operational risk event capture, (b) a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements, (c) key risk indicators, and (d) process and entity-level risk assessments. \n\nThe framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes, impact to customers and/or us, and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect, remediate customers, and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues. The impact is assessed from an operational, financial, brand, regulatory compliance and legal perspective. \n\nInformation and Cyber Security \n\nWe define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of American Express customer, colleague or proprietary information. \n\nOur information and cyber security program is designed to protect information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly trained team of experts, and operations based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents. We continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem. \n\nSee &#8220;A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services&#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information. \n\nInformation Technology \n\nWe define information technology risk as the risk that events or circumstances could compromise the processing, stability, capacity, performance, or resilience of information technology and cause financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts. \n\nWe manage information technology risk through our policies, procedures, governance structure, and control framework to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and processes across our Company. \n\nSee &#8220;The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations&#8221; under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information. \n\nPrivacy \n\nWe define privacy risk as the risk of financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory or legal action resulting from decisions related to the violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, contractual obligations, or the non-adherence to privacy policies, disclosures, or standards that apply to the processing of personal data. \n\nThe Global Privacy Policy establishes the privacy framework and defines the American Express Data Protection &#38; Privacy Principles, which governs the way we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete or otherwise process our customer and colleague personal data globally. Chaired by the Chief Privacy Officer, the Privacy Risk Management Committee, a sub-committee of the ORMC, provides oversight and governance for our privacy program. \n\nData Management and Governance \n\nWe define data management and governance risk as the risk of financial, reputational, and/or regulatory impacts due to inadequate data governance and/or data management practices adversely impacting the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, comprehensiveness or usability of data throughout its lifecycle. \n\nOur Enterprise Data Governance Policy establishes the framework for defining in-scope critical data and the requirements for managing such data effectively throughout its lifecycle as a critical corporate asset. This policy is approved by the ERMC. \n\nChaired by the Chief Data Officer, our Enterprise Data Committee, a sub-committee of the ERMC, provides governance and oversight for our enterprise-wide data governance and management activities. \n\nThird Party Risk \n\nWe define third party risk as the risk that relationships with third parties (including their significant subcontractors) create unexpected outcomes and deviations from expectations or stated obligations. The Third Party Management Policy is approved by the Risk Committee of our Board and the ERMC. It sets forth the procurement, risk management, and contracting framework for managing third-party relationships commensurate with their risk and complexity. Our Third Party Lifecycle Management program sets guidelines for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and reporting the risk associated with third parties through the life cycle of the relationships, which includes planning, due diligence and third-party selection, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination. \n\nConduct Risk \n\nWe define conduct risk as the risk that colleagues, intentionally or unintentionally, fail to fulfill their responsibilities to American Express, our customers, colleagues or stakeholders in a manner consistent with our Code of Conduct, policies and values as well as applicable laws and regulations. Conduct issues also have the potential to increase several other risk types, including reputational risk, which may undermine the integrity and trust upon which our brand is built. \n\nThe Conduct Risk Management Policy is approved by the ERMC. It establishes the governance framework for conduct risk across the Company. The policy requires annual risk assessments, implementation of detective and preventive controls, colleague training and timely escalations of conduct issues. It also provides guidance on consequence management for any substantiated cases of misconduct. The Conduct Risk Committee oversees conduct risk related topics and escalates such matters to the ERMC, as appropriate. \n\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm, fines, monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, internal policies and procedures and related practices, or ethical standards. \n\nWe view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model. Our Global Compliance and Ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate-wide Compliance Risk Management Program. Pursuant to this program, we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing, controlling, monitoring, measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed. The Compliance Risk Management Committee (CRMC), chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing, and escalating compliance risks. The CRMC has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ERMC and the Audit and Compliance Committee. \n\nWe have a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities. The program includes an independent risk assessment of the rules used by the Anti-Money Laundering team. In addition, the Internal Audit Group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance. \n\nREPUTATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products, services, client and partner relationships, business activities and policies, management and workplace culture, or our response to unexpected events, could cause sustained critical media coverage, a decline in revenue or investment, talent attrition, litigation, or government or regulatory scrutiny. \n\nWe view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service, trust, security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the world&#8217;s best customer experience and fundamental to our long-term success. \n\nOur business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed. The ERMC is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ERMC. \n\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define market risk as the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include (i) interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits) and (ii) foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \n\nOur risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management, including quantitative limits and escalation triggers. These policies are approved by the ERMC, Asset Liability Committee or Market Risk Management Committee. \n\nMarket risk is managed by the Market Risk Management Committee. The Market Risk Oversight Officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and Asset Liability Management activities, as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements. Market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments, funding, liquidity and investments. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nWe analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets, liabilities and the economic value of equity. Our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of, among other things, the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed-rate debt and deposits compared to our Card Member loans and receivables. Interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variable-rate from fixed-rate, or vice versa. Refer to Note 13 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately $141 million on our annual net interest income. This measure first projects net interest income over the following twelve-month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates. The detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by 100 basis points. Our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelve-month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude, subject to applicable interest rate caps or floors, as benchmark rates change. It is further assumed that, within our interest-rate sensitive liabilities, certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements, and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on, among other factors, the direction of rate movements. These assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio. Actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors, and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates. \n\nForeign Exchange Risk \n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. \n\nThese foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur. As of December 31, 2022, foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately $34 billion were outstanding. \n\nWith respect to Card Member spending and cross-currency transactions, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of December 31, 2022. With respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances, including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of December 31, 2022. With respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar would be approximately $153 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nTo a much lesser extent, we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our Foreign Exchange International Payments business. We aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging, where appropriate, and the establishment of limits. \n\nThe actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on, among other factors, the timing of rate changes, the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree, changes in the cost, volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses. \n\nFUNDING &#38; LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define funding and liquidity risk as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations at a reasonable cost as they become due. \n\nOur Board-approved Liquidity Risk Policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management. \n\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed by the Funding and Liquidity Committee. To manage this risk, we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelve-month period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. We consider the trade-offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, and having inadequate liquidity, which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event. \n\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained. The Funding and Liquidity Committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements, approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions, establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken. \n\nMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences, such as financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, damage to our reputation or customer harm, from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes. \n\nThe Enterprise-Wide Model Risk Policy establishes the comprehensive framework for governing model risk. This policy is approved by the ERMC. The comprehensive risk management and governance framework includes procedures for model development, independent model validation, model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology, outputs, and misuse. We also assess model performance and model- related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models for a variety of business use cases. We perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these AI/ML techniques result in adverse consequences. \n\nSTRATEGIC AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define strategic and business risk as the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions, including decisions related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services. \n\nStrategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies. We seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals. Existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following Executive Committee due diligence, a comprehensive risk assessment by operational, market, credit and oversight leaders provided to the Chief Risk Officer and approval by either the Chief Risk Officer or appropriate risk committees. All new and material changes to products and services are reviewed and approved by the New Products Committee and appropriate credit or risk committees. \n\nCOUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS \n\nWe define country risk as the risk that economic, social, and/or political conditions and events in a country present. They might adversely impact us, primarily as a result of greater credit losses, increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital. \n\nWe manage country risk as part of the normal course of business. Policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure, driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) AND CLIMATE-RELATED RISK \n\nWe define climate-related risk as: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy, legal, technology, market and reputational risks, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, hurricanes, floods) and chronic physical risk which are longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sea level rise, chronic heat waves). Such transition and physical risk events driven by climate change can have broad impact on our customers, operations, suppliers and business. \n\nClimate-related risk is interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk or other risk types. We continue to enhance our focus on climate-related risk within our risk governance framework. We are currently performing a risk identification process for climate-related risk to determine the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk. Furthermore, ESG risks, with an emphasis on climate-related risk, are currently identified as an &#8220;emerging risk&#8221; within our risk governance framework. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nRefer to Note 1 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for a summary of our significant accounting policies. Certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows: \n\nRESERVES FOR CARD MEMBER CREDIT LOSSES \n\nReserves for Card Member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date. The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&#38;S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. \n\nIn estimating expected credit losses, we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses. These quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&#38;S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the R&#38;S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component. Through an established governance structure, we consider certain external and internal factors, including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for Card Member credit losses. \n\nThe R&#38;S Period, which is approximately three years, represents the maximum time-period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses, using all available portfolio information, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Card Member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made, causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the R&#38;S Period. To determine expected credit losses beyond the R&#38;S Period, we immediately revert to long-term average loss rates. Card Member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full; therefore, we have assumed the balances will be either paid or written-off no later than 180 days past due. \n\nWithin the R&#38;S Period, our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. A significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future Card Member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default. The nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior, which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period. Using historical customer behavior and other factors, we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend. We then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend. Any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance. \n\nCECL requires that the R&#38;S Period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions. We incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. The estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect management's judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real GDP, that are significant to our models. \n\nMacroeconomic Sensitivity \n\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios, we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario. As of December 31, 2022, for every 10 percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario, the estimated credit losses increased by approximately $120 million. \n\nThe modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration, severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios, under different conditions or using different assumptions, could result in significantly different estimated credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses, and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes. \n\nIn addition, this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering management&#8217;s judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios, including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date, or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component, which may have a positive or negative effect on the results. Thus, the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment. \n\nRefer to Note 3 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used, in conjunction with other inputs described above, to calculate reserves for Card Member credit losses. \n\nThe process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment. To the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance, actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations, resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period. \n\nLIABILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP REWARDS \n\nThe Membership Rewards program is our largest card-based rewards program. Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. \n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information. \n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. \n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. \n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense. \n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $157 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $190 million. \n\nGOODWILL RECOVERABILITY \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise, such as adverse changes in the business climate, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment. \n\nWe have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment. We could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit, bypassing the qualitative assessment. \n\nOur methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units, which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment. For valuation, we use a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples) in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. \n\nWhen preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit&#8217;s internal multi-year forecast, and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions. To discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity, determined using a capital asset pricing model. When using the market method under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies&#8217; multiples (e.g., earnings, revenues) to our reporting units&#8217; operating results. The judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows, discount rates and market comparables is significant, and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. \n\nWe could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management&#8217;s current assumptions. \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer&#8217;s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws. \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nWe establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements. \n\nIn establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position should be sustained. A tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits. The amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement. As new information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate . \n\nTax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties, with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax. \n\nDeferred Tax Asset Realization \n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. \n\nSince deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. These assessments are performed quarterly, taking into account any new information. \n\nChanges in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties. \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nAs previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned. We completed our review of this matter in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in an immaterial impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nRefer to the Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; \n\nGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY \n\nAdjusted net interest income &#8212; A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. \n\nAirline-related volume &#8212; Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&#38;E-related volume. \n\nAsset securitizations &#8212; Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nAverage discount rate &#8212; This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue. \n\nBilled business (Card Member spending) &#8212; Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express. \n\nCapital ratios &#8212; Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; for further related definitions under Basel III. \n\nCard Member &#8212; The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card. \n\nCard Member loans &#8212; Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees. \n\nCard Member receivables &#8212; Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date. \n\nCards-in-force &#8212; Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base. \n\nCharge cards &#8212; Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member&#8217;s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time. \n\nCobrand cards &#8212; Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner&#8217;s own loyalty program. \n\nCredit cards &#8212; Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures. \n\nDiscount revenue &#8212; Discount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. \n\nGoods and Services (G&#38;S)-related volume &#8212; Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&#38;E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments. \n\nInterest expense &#8212; Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. \n\nInterest income &#8212; Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. \n\nInterest on loans &#8212; Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. \n\nInterest and dividends on investment securities &#8212; Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. \n\nInterest income on deposits with banks and other &#8212; Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. \n\nLoyalty coalitions &#8212; Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support. \n\nNet card fees &#8212; Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. \n\nNet interest yield on average Card Member loans &#8212; A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. \n\nNet write-off rate &#8212; principal only &#8212; Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period. \n\nNet write-off rate &#8212; principal, interest and fees &#8212; Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. \n\nNetwork volumes &#8212; Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes. \n\nOperating expenses &#8212; Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses. \n\nProcessed revenue &#8212; Represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. Processed revenue also includes fees earned on alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. \n\nProcessed volumes &#8212; Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. \n\nReserve build (release) &#8212; Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses. \n\nT&#38;E-related volume &#8212; Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories. \n\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. \n\nOur internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and includes those policies and procedures that: \n\n&#8226; Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets; \n\n&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and \n\n&#8226; Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control &#8212;Integrated Framework (2013). \n\nBased on management&#8217;s assessment and those criteria, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. \n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report appearing on the following page on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of American Express Company \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders&#8217; equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nChange in Accounting Principle \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nReserves for Credit Losses on Card Member Loans \n\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans represent management&#8217;s estimate of the expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s outstanding portfolio of Card Member loans as of the balance sheet date. The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&#38;S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of the Company&#8217;s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&#38;S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions. Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&#38;S Period, the Company&#8217;s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&#38;S Period, expected credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs, qualitative reserves, and significant assumptions, including the R&#38;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&#38;S Period and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for estimating the reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans through (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management&#8217;s methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and significant assumptions used to estimate the reserves. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management&#8217;s methodology and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves and certain significant assumptions, including the R&#38;S Period and the loss rates used to estimate expected credit losses beyond the R&#38;S Period. \n\nMembership Rewards Liability \n\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Membership Rewards liability represents management&#8217;s estimate of the cost of Membership Rewards points earned that are expected to be redeemed in the future. The Membership Rewards liability was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. As disclosed by management, the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management&#8217;s assumption to evaluate its reasonableness and (iii) comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management&#8217;s estimate. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nNew York, New York \n\nFebruary 10, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2005. \n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ##TABLE_START \n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nPAGE \n\nConsolidated Statements of Income &#8211;

Our principal products and services are credit and charge card products, along with travel and lifestyle related services, offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Our various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. \n\nRefer to Note 24 for additional discussion of the products and services that comprise each segment. Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. \n\nWe consolidate entities in which we hold a &#8220;controlling financial interest.&#8221; For voting interest entities, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are able to exercise control over the investees&#8217; operating and financial decisions. For variable interest entities (VIEs), the determination of which is based on the amount and characteristics of the entity&#8217;s equity, we are considered to hold a controlling financial interest when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact that VIE&#8217;s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb the losses of, or the right to receive the benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. \n\nEntities in which our voting interest in common equity does not provide it with control, but allows us to exert significant influence over operating and financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method. We also have investments in equity securities where our voting interest is below the level of significant influence, including investments that we make in non-public companies in the ordinary course of business. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted to fair value through earnings for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same company or if they are determined to be impaired. See Note 4 for the accounting policy for our marketable equity securities. \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY \n\nTransactions conducted in currencies other than the applicable functional currency of an entity are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At the period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using period end rates. The resulting transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nFor subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities and results of operations are translated for consolidation purposes into U.S. dollars at period-end rates for monetary assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting translation adjustments, along with any related qualifying hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), a component of shareholders&#8217; equity. Translation adjustments, including qualifying hedge and tax effects, are reclassified to earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of investments in foreign operations. \n\nAMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management&#8217;s assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ. \n\nINCOME STATEMENT \n\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. We are not required to disclose revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g., discount revenue). Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to all other contracts with customers is not material. \n\nDiscount Revenue \n\nDiscount revenue represents the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant&#8217;s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. Discount revenue is generally recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. \n\nCard acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and mid-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network. \n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our network partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. \n\nNet Card Fees \n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nService Fees and Other Revenue \n\nService fees and other revenue includes service fees earned from merchants and other customers and travel commissions and fees, which are generally recognized in the period when the service is performed, and delinquency and foreign currency-related fees, which are primarily recognized in the period when they are charged to the Card Member. In addition, Service fees and other revenue includes income (losses) from our investments in which we have significant influence and therefore account for under the equity method. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. \n\nProcessed Revenue \n\nProcessed revenue primarily represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we settle with merchants and our third-party merchant acquirers on behalf of our network card issuing partners. The amount of fees charged for accepting American Express-branded cards is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant or third-party merchant acquirer and recorded as Processed revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. Our network card issuing partners receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as contra-revenue within Processed revenue to the extent that there is revenue from the same customer, after which any additional issuer rate is recorded as expense in Business development. Processed revenue also includes fees related to alternative payment solutions, which are generally recognized when the service is performed. \n\nContra-revenue \n\nPayments made pursuant to contractual arrangements with our merchants, network partners, and other customers are classified as contra-revenue, except where we receive goods, services or other benefits for which the fair value is determinable and measurable, in which case they are recorded as expense. \n\nInterest Income \n\nInterest on Card Member loans is assessed using the average daily balance method. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding, in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement, until the outstanding balance is paid, or written off. \n\nInterest and dividends on investment securities primarily relate to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security&#8217;s outstanding balance. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. \n\nInterest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt. \n\nCard Member Rewards \n\nWe issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership Rewards, cash back and cobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by spending on their enrolled card products. For Membership Rewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the rewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated cost of points earned. For cobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make associated payments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner&#8217;s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nBusiness Development \n\nBusiness development expense includes payments to our cobrand partners, corporate client incentive payments earned on achievement of pre-set targets and certain payments to network partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. \n\nCard Member Services \n\nCard Member services expense represents costs incurred in providing our Card Members with various value-added benefits and services, which are generally expensed as incurred. \n\nMarketing \n\nMarketing expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of advertising, which are expensed in the period in which the advertising first takes place. All other marketing expenses are generally expensed as incurred. \n\nBALANCE SHEET \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt maturities of consolidated VIEs. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager. \n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment. \n\nThis qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment. \n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount over and above the reporting unit's fair value. \n\nWhen measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation techniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market multiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of equity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market multiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies&#8217; multiples (e.g., earnings or revenues) to our reporting units&#8217; operating results. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for those reporting units which were impacted by the realignment of our operating segments and concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. Refer to Note 24 for further information on the realignment of our operating segments. \n\nPremises and Equipment \n\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for equipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date. \n\nCertain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in Premises and equipment. Once the specific software feature is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software&#8217;s estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using the same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets. \n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at the fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term. \n\nLeases \n\nWe have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months, are recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components. Lease-related assets, or right-of-use assets, are recognized at the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and lease incentives. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. \n\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe following table identifies our other significant accounting policies, along with the related Note. ##TABLE_START Significant Accounting Policy Note Number Note Title Loans and Card Member Receivables Note 2 Loans and Card Member Receivables Reserves for Credit Losses Note 3 Reserves for Credit Losses Investment Securities Note 4 Investment Securities Asset Securitizations Note 5 Asset Securitizations Legal Contingencies Note 12 Contingencies and Commitments Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities Note 13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities Fair Value Measurements Note 14 Fair Values Guarantees Note 15 Guarantees Income Taxes Note 20 Income Taxes ##TABLE_END \n\nCLASSIFICATION OF VARIOUS ITEMS \n\nCertain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new accounting guidance on troubled debt restructuring (TDR) and write-offs, effective January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The amendments eliminate the existing TDR guidance for those entities that have adopted Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, create a single loan modification accounting model and enhance disclosure requirements for loan modifications and write-offs. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2023, our financial statements will reflect the adoption of this standard on a prospective basis. The updated guidance will not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit reserving methodology, applicable to certain financial instruments, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology resulting in an increase in the reserves for total loans and receivables credit losses on adoption, which was recorded under a modified retrospective transition with an offset to the opening balance of retained earnings. Refer to Note 3 for how management estimates reserves for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology. \n\nNOTE 2 \n\nLOANS AND CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES \n\nOur lending and charge payment card products that we offer to consumer, small business and corporate customers result in the generation of Card Member loans and Card Member receivables. We also extend credit to customers through non-card financing products, resulting in Other loans. \n\nCARD MEMBER AND OTHER LOANS \n\nCard Member loans are generally recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any finance charges and associated card-related fees. Card Members with outstanding revolving loans are required to make a minimum monthly payment, and the balances that Card Members choose to revolve are subject to finance charges. These loans have varying terms such as credit limits, interest rates, fees and payment structures, which can be revised over time based on new information about Card Members, and in accordance with applicable regulations and the respective product&#8217;s terms and conditions. \n\nCard Member loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees. Our policy generally is to cease accruing interest on a Card Member loan at the time the account is written off, and establish reserves for interest that we believe will not be collected. \n\nOther loans are recorded at the time any extension of credit is provided to consumer and commercial customers for non-card financing products. These loans have a range of fixed terms such as interest rates, fees and repayment periods. Borrowers are typically required to make pre-established monthly payments over the term of the loan. Non-card financing products are not associated with a Card Member agreement, and instead are governed by a separate borrowing relationship. Other loans are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses, and include principal and any related accrued interest and fees. \n\nCard Member and Other loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 \n\nConsumer (a) \n\n$ 84,964 &#160; $ 70,467 &#160; Small Business 22,947 &#160; 18,040 &#160; Corporate 53 &#160; 55 &#160; Card Member loans 107,964 &#160; 88,562 &#160; Less: Reserves for credit losses 3,747 &#160; 3,305 &#160; Card Member loans, net $ 104,217 &#160; $ 85,257 &#160; \n\nOther loans, net (b) \n\n$ 5,357 &#160; $ 2,859 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes approximately $ 28.5 billion and $ 26.6 billion of gross Card Member loans available to settle obligations of a consolidated VIE as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n(b) Other loans represent consumer and commercial non-card financing products, and Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. There were $ 7 million and $ 36 million of gross PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other loans are presented net of reserves for credit losses of $ 59 million and $ 52 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES \n\nCard Member receivables are recorded at the time a Card Member enters into a point-of-sale transaction with a merchant and represent amounts due on our card products and card-related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member&#8217;s payment due date. \n\nCharge Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. Card Member receivable balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of reserves for credit losses (refer to Note 3), and include principal and any related accrued fees. \n\nCard Member receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 Consumer $ 22,885 &#160; $ 22,392 &#160; Small Business 19,629 &#160; 17,977 &#160; \n\nCorporate (a) \n\n15,099 &#160; 13,276 &#160; Card Member receivables 57,613 &#160; 53,645 &#160; Less: Reserves for credit losses 229 &#160; 64 &#160; Card Member receivables, net $ 57,384 &#160; $ 53,581 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes $ 5.2 billion of gross Card Member receivables available to settle obligations of a consolidated VIE as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nCARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AGING \n\nGenerally, a Card Member account is considered past due if payment due is not received within 30 days after the billing statement date. The following table presents the aging of Card Member loans and receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: ##TABLE_START 2022 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: Consumer $ 84,102 &#160; $ 281 &#160; $ 198 &#160; $ 383 &#160; $ 84,964 &#160; Small Business 22,731 &#160; 81 &#160; 49 &#160; 86 &#160; 22,947 &#160; \n\nCorporate (a) \n\n(b) (b) (b) &#8212; &#160; 53 &#160; Card Member Receivables: Consumer 22,634 &#160; 83 &#160; 56 &#160; 112 &#160; 22,885 &#160; Small Business $ 19,330 &#160; $ 120 &#160; $ 69 &#160; $ 110 &#160; $ 19,629 &#160; \n\nCorporate (a) \n\n(b) (b) (b) $ 85 &#160; $ 15,099 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 2021 (Millions) Current 30-59 Days Past Due 60-89 Days Past Due 90+ Days Past Due Total Card Member Loans: Consumer $ 69,960 &#160; $ 158 &#160; $ 112 &#160; $ 237 &#160; $ 70,467 &#160; Small Business 17,950 &#160; 34 &#160; 19 &#160; 37 &#160; 18,040 &#160; \n\nCorporate (a) \n\n(b) (b) (b) &#8212; &#160; 55 &#160; Card Member Receivables: Consumer 22,279 &#160; 41 &#160; 24 &#160; 48 &#160; 22,392 &#160; Small Business $ 17,846 &#160; $ 59 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 44 &#160; $ 17,977 &#160; \n\nCorporate (a) \n\n(b) (b) (b) $ 42 &#160; $ 13,276 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) For corporate accounts, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. A Card Member account is considered 90 days past billing if payment has not been received within 90 days of the Card Member&#8217;s billing statement date. In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member loan or receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. These amounts are shown above as 90+ Days Past Due for presentation purposes. See also (b). \n\n(b) Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. Therefore, such data has not been utilized for risk management purposes. The balances that are current to 89 days past due can be derived as the difference between the Total and the 90+ Days Past Due balances. \n\nCREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS FOR CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES \n\nThe following tables present the key credit quality indicators as of or for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Net Write-Off Rate Net Write-Off Rate Principal \n\nOnly (a) \n\nPrincipal, \n\nInterest &#38; \n\nFees (a) \n\n30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Principal \n\nOnly (a) \n\nPrincipal, \n\nInterest &#38; \n\nFees (a) \n\n30+ Days Past Due as a % of Total Card Member Loans: Consumer 0.9 &#160; % 1.2 &#160; % 1.0 &#160; % 0.9 &#160; % 1.3 &#160; % 0.7 &#160; % Small Business 0.7 &#160; % 0.8 &#160; % 0.9 &#160; % 0.6 &#160; % 0.8 &#160; % 0.5 &#160; % Card Member Receivables: Consumer 0.8 &#160; % 0.9 &#160; % 1.1 &#160; % 0.3 &#160; % 0.4 &#160; % 0.5 &#160; % Small Business 1.1 &#160; % 1.2 &#160; % 1.5 &#160; % 0.3 &#160; % 0.4 &#160; % 0.7 &#160; % Corporate (d) \n\n(b) 0.4 &#160; % (c) (b) &#8212; &#160; % (c) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) We present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented. \n\n(b) Net write-off rate based on principal losses only is not available due to system constraints. \n\n(c) For corporate receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. Delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing is not available due to system constraints. 90+ days past billing as a % of total was 0.6 % and 0.3 % as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n(d) The net write-off rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $ 37 million partial recovery in Card Member receivables related to a corporate client bankruptcy, which had resulted in a write-off in the year ended December 21, 2020. \n\nRefer to Note 3 for additional indicators, including external environmental qualitative factors, management considers in its evaluation process for reserves for credit losses. \n\nIMPAIRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES \n\nImpaired loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the customer agreement. We consider impaired loans and receivables to include (i) loans over 90 days past due still accruing interest, (ii) non-accrual loans and (iii) loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). \n\nIn instances where the customer is experiencing financial difficulty, we may modify, through various financial relief programs, loans and receivables with the intention to minimize losses and improve collectability, while providing customers with temporary or permanent financial relief. We have classified loans and receivables in these modification programs as TDRs and continue to classify customer accounts that have exited a modification program as a TDR, with such accounts identified as &#8220;Out of Program TDRs.&#8221; \n\nSuch modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include (i) temporary interest rate reductions (possibly as low as zero percent, in which case the loan is characterized as non-accrual in our TDR disclosures), (ii) placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and (iii) suspending delinquency fees until the customer exits the modification program. Upon entering the modification program, the customer&#8217;s ability to make future purchases is either limited, canceled, or in certain cases suspended until the customer successfully exits from the modification program. In accordance with the modification agreement with the customer, loans and/or receivables may revert back to the original contractual terms (including the contractual interest rate where applicable) when the customer exits the modification program, which is (i) when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or (ii) when the customer defaults out of the modification program. \n\nReserves for modifications deemed TDRs are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model.

The CECL methodology requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&#38;S Period), which is approximately three years, beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses . \n\nWe use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the R&#38;S Period. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month of the R&#38;S Period. Beyond the R&#38;S Period, we estimate expected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. \n\n&#8226; PD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off. \n\n&#8226; EAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer. Due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios, the EAD models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors. \n\n&#8226; Recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from Card Members after default occurs, typically as a result of collection efforts. Future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default, time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions. \n\nWe also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions, even if such expected recoveries exceed expected losses. Our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses. \n\nFuture economic conditions that are incorporated over the R&#38;S Period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party. Management reviews these economic scenarios each period and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables, including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product (GDP), that are significant to our models. \n\nWe also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. We consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves (higher or lower) to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions. \n\nLifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity, including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics, such as past spend and remittance behaviors, credit bureau scores where available, delinquency status, tenure of balance outstanding, amongst others. Credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of Reserves for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and within the Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than reversing interest income. Separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring, which are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model. See Note 2 for information on troubled debt restructurings. \n\nLoans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible, which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than 180 days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and 120 days past due for term loans. Loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification. \n\nThe following table reflects the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used, in conjunction with other inputs, to calculate reserves for credit losses: ##TABLE_START U.S. Unemployment Rate U.S. GDP Growth (Contraction) (a) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fourth quarter of 2022 4 % \n\n4 % - 9 % \n\n( 0.1 )% \n\n2 % - 1 % \n\nFirst quarter of 2023 3 % - 6 % \n\n3 % - 9 % \n\n5 % - ( 1 )% \n\n3 % - 1 % \n\nFourth quarter of 2023 3 % - 8 % \n\n3 % - 7 % \n\n6 % - 0.2 % \n\n4 % - 3 % \n\nFourth quarter of 2024 3 % - 7 % \n\n4 % - 6 % \n\n3 % - 2 % \n\n3 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Real GDP quarter over quarter percentage change seasonally adjusted to annualized rates. \n\nCHANGES IN CARD MEMBER LOANS RESERVE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n\nCard Member loans reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by an increase in loans outstanding, higher delinquencies and changes in macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by the release of COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves. \n\nCard Member loans reserve for credit losses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding. \n\nThe following table presents changes in the Card Member loans reserve for credit losses for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Beginning Balance $ 3,305 &#160; $ 5,344 &#160; $ 4,027 &#160; Provisions (a) \n\n1,514 &#160; ( 1,155 ) 3,453 &#160; Net write-offs (b) \n\nPrincipal ( 837 ) ( 672 ) ( 1,795 ) Interest and fees ( 229 ) ( 207 ) ( 375 ) Other (c) \n\n( 6 ) ( 5 ) 34 &#160; Ending Balance $ 3,747 &#160; $ 3,305 &#160; $ 5,344 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Provisions for principal, interest and fee reserve components.

The methodology for estimating credit losses for available for sale debt securities requires us to estimate lifetime credit losses for all available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. When estimating a security&#8217;s probability of default and the recovery rate, we assess the security&#8217;s credit indicators, including credit ratings. If our assessment indicates that an estimated credit loss exists, we determine the portion of the unrealized loss attributable to credit deterioration and record a reserve for the estimated credit loss through the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other loans Provision for credit losses. Unrealized gains and any portion of a security&#8217;s unrealized loss attributable to non-credit losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, net of tax. We had accrued interest on our available-for-sale debt securities totaling $ 12 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, presented as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nInvestment securities also include equity securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other, net expense. \n\nRealized gains and losses are recognized upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other, net expense. \n\nRefer to Note 14 for a description of our methodology for determining the fair value of investment securities. \n\nThe following is a summary of investment securities as of December 31: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 \n\nDescription of Securities (Millions) \n\nCost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Fair Value Available-for-sale debt securities: State and municipal obligations $ 64 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 10 ) $ 54 &#160; $ 106 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 111 &#160; U.S. Government agency obligations 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; U.S. Government treasury obligations 3,859 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 73 ) 3,786 &#160; 1,680 &#160; 25 &#160; ( 1 ) 1,704 &#160; Mortgage-backed securities (a) \n\n13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; 17 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; Foreign government bonds and obligations 633 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) 632 &#160; 630 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 630 &#160; Other (b) \n\n47 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 47 &#160; 43 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 43 &#160; \n\nEquity securities (c) \n\n50 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 9 ) 41 &#160; 66 &#160; 17 &#160; ( 4 ) 79 &#160; Total $ 4,671 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 93 ) $ 4,578 &#160; $ 2,548 &#160; $ 48 &#160; $ ( 5 ) $ 2,591 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. \n\n(b) Represents investments in debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions.

We concluded that there was no credit loss attributable to the securities in an unrealized loss position for the periods presented. \n\nThe following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses for available-for-sale debt securities by ratio of fair value to amortized cost as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: ##TABLE_START Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total \n\nRatio of Fair Value to \n\nAmortized Cost (Dollars in millions) \n\nNumber of Securities Estimated Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Number of Securities Estimated Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Number of Securities Estimated Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses 2022: 90%&#8211;100% 74 $ 4,287 &#160; $ ( 74 ) 3 $ 52 &#160; $ ( 1 ) 77 $ 4,339 &#160; $ ( 75 ) Less than 90% 14 24 &#160; ( 9 ) &#8212; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 24 &#160; ( 9 ) Total as of December 31, 2022 88 $ 4,311 &#160; $ ( 83 ) 3 $ 52 &#160; $ ( 1 ) 91 $ 4,363 &#160; $ ( 84 ) 2021: 90%&#8211;100% 5 $ 477 &#160; $ ( 1 ) &#8212; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 5 $ 477 &#160; $ ( 1 ) Less than 90% &#8212; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total as of December 31, 2021 5 $ 477 &#160; $ ( 1 ) &#8212; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 5 $ 477 &#160; $ ( 1 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nWeighted average yields and contractual maturities for available-for-sale debt securities with stated maturities as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) Due within 1 year Due after 1 year but within 5 years Due after 5 years but within 10 years Due after 10 years Total \n\nState and municipal obligations (a) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 33 &#160; $ 54 &#160; \n\nU.S. Government agency obligations (a) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 4 &#160; 5 &#160; U.S. Government treasury obligations 2,668 &#160; 1,109 &#160; 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,786 &#160; \n\nMortgage-backed securities (a)(b) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; 13 &#160; Foreign government bonds and obligations 631 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 632 &#160; \n\nOther (c) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 42 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 47 &#160; Total Estimated Fair Value $ 3,299 &#160; $ 1,152 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 50 &#160; $ 4,537 &#160; Total Cost $ 3,348 &#160; $ 1,177 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 60 &#160; $ 4,621 &#160; \n\nWeighted average yield (d) \n\n2.63 &#160; % 3.19 &#160; % 5.06 &#160; % 2.85 &#160; % 2.80 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The expected payments on state and municipal obligations, U.S. Government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because the issuers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. \n\n(b) Represents mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. \n\n(c) Represents investments in debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions. \n\n(d) Average yields for investment securities have been calculated using the effective yield on the date of purchase.

The Trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. \n\nThe Trusts are considered VIEs as they have insufficient equity at risk to finance their activities, which are to issue debt securities that are collateralized by the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. Refer to Note 1 for further details on the principles of consolidation. We perform the servicing and key decision making for the Trusts, and therefore have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Trusts&#8217; economic performance, which are the collection of the underlying Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors. Our ownership of variable interests in the Lending Trust was $ 16.0 billion and $ 15.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and in the Charge Trust was $ 5.2 billion and $ 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts. \n\nThe debt securities issued by the Trusts are non-recourse to us. The securitized Card Member loans and receivables held by the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust, respectively, are available only for payment of the debt securities or other obligations issued or arising in the securitization transactions (refer to Note 2). The long-term debt of each Trust is payable only out of collections on their respective underlying securitized assets (refer to Note 8). \n\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Lending Trust was $ 59 million and $ 42 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and by the Charge Trust was nil and $ 1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities. \n\nUnder the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no such triggering events occurred. \n\nNOTE 6 \n\nOTHER ASSETS \n\nThe following is a summary of Other assets as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 Goodwill $ 3,786 &#160; $ 3,804 &#160; Other intangible assets, at amortized cost 146 &#160; 201 &#160; \n\nOther (a) \n\n13,757 &#160; 13,239 &#160; Total $ 17,689 &#160; $ 17,244 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily includes net deferred tax assets, other receivables net of reserves, investments in non-consolidated entities, prepaid assets, tax credit investments and right-of-use lease assets. \n\nGOODWILL \n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill reported in our reportable operating segments were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) USCS CS ICS GMNS Total Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 369 &#160; $ 2,124 &#160; $ 799 &#160; $ 560 &#160; $ 3,852 &#160; Acquisitions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Dispositions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) \n\nOther (a) \n\n( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 43 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 45 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 368 &#160; $ 2,123 &#160; $ 753 &#160; $ 560 &#160; $ 3,804 &#160; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; Dispositions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nOther (a) \n\n( 2 ) ( 1 ) ( 28 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 31 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 379 &#160; $ 2,122 &#160; $ 725 &#160; $ 560 &#160; $ 3,786 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily includes foreign currency translation. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for those reporting units which were impacted by the realignment of our operating segments and concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values. Accumulated impairment losses were $ 221 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 22 years. We review long-lived assets and asset groups, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the asset or asset group&#8217;s fair value. \n\nThe gross carrying amount for other intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 720 million and $ 733 million, respectively, with accumulated amortization of $ 574 million and $ 532 million, respectively. \n\nAmortization expense was $ 51 million, $ 57 million and $ 54 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For other intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, amortization expense is expected to be $ 49 million in 2023, $ 44 million in 2024, $ 20 million in 2025, $ 10 million in 2026, $ 9 million in 2027 and $ 14 million thereafter. \n\nTAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS \n\nWe account for our qualified affordable housing (QAH) investments using the proportional amortization method (PAM), which we elected to implement on January 1, 2021 on a prospective basis, and other tax credit investments using the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 1,207 million and $ 1,124 million in tax credit investments, respectively, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $ 1,146 million and $ 1,084 million, respectively, related to QAH investments. Included in QAH investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 980 million and $ 994 million, respectively, related to investments in unconsolidated VIEs for which we do not have a controlling financial interest. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we committed to provide funding related to certain of these QAH investments, which is expected to be paid between 2023 and 2040 , resulting in $ 348 million in unfunded commitments reported in Other liabilities, of which $ 222 million specifically related to unconsolidated VIEs. \n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2022 we had contractual off-balance sheet obligations to provide additional funding up to $ 13 million for these QAH investments, fully related to unconsolidated VIEs. We may be required to fund these amounts between 2023 and 2036. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized QAH investment losses of $ 161 million and $ 226 million, respectively, with associated tax credits of $ 141 million and $ 135 million, respectively, in Income tax provision. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we recognized QAH investment equity method losses of $ 128 million, in Other, net expenses, with associated tax credits of $ 129 million, recognized in Income tax provision. \n\nNOTE 7 \n\nCUSTOMER DEPOSITS \n\nAs of December 31, customer deposits were categorized as interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 U.S.: Interest-bearing $ 109,119 &#160; $ 83,304 &#160; Non-interest-bearing (includes Card Member credit balances of: 2022, $ 605 ; 2021, $ 527 ) \n\n663 &#160; 553 &#160; Non-U.S.: Interest-bearing 15 &#160; 18 &#160; Non-interest-bearing (includes Card Member credit balances of: 2022, $ 439 ; 2021, $ 503 ) \n\n442 &#160; 507 &#160; Total customer deposits $ 110,239 &#160; $ 84,382 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCustomer deposits by deposit type as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 Savings and transaction accounts $ 76,731 &#160; $ 66,142 &#160; Certificates of deposit: \n\nDirect 2,765 &#160; 1,415 &#160; Third-party (brokered) 13,331 &#160; 3,095 &#160; Sweep accounts &#8213;Third-party (brokered) 16,297 &#160; 12,658 &#160; Other deposits 71 &#160; 42 &#160; Card Member credit balances 1,044 &#160; 1,030 &#160; Total customer deposits $ 110,239 &#160; $ 84,382 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 5 years Total Certificates of deposit $ 5,790 &#160; $ 6,554 &#160; $ 2,939 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 786 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 16,096 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, certificates of deposit in denominations of $250,000 or more, in the aggregate, were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 U.S. $ 998 &#160; $ 521 &#160; Non-U.S. 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Total $ 999 &#160; $ 522 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 8 \n\nDEBT \n\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS \n\nOur short-term borrowings outstanding, defined as borrowings with original contractual maturity dates of less than one year, as of December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (Millions, except percentages) Outstanding Balance Year-End Stated \n\nInterest Rate on \n\nDebt (a) \n\nOutstanding Balance Year-End Stated \n\nInterest Rate on \n\nDebt (a) \n\nShort-term borrowings (b) \n\n$ 1,348 &#160; 0.94 &#160; % $ 2,243 &#160; 0.58 &#160; % Total $ 1,348 &#160; 0.94 &#160; % $ 2,243 &#160; 0.58 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) For floating-rate issuances, the stated interest rates are weighted based on the outstanding principal balances and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n(b) Includes borrowings from banks and book overdrafts with banks due to timing differences arising in the ordinary course of business. \n\nWe maintained a three-year committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility that gives us the right to sell up to $ 2.0 billion face amount of eligible certificates issued from the Lending Trust at any time through September 16, 2024 .

These committed facilities do not contain material adverse change clauses, which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facilities, nor are they dependent on our credit rating. \n\nWe paid total interest, primarily related to short- and long-term debt, corresponding interest rate swaps and customer deposits, of $ 2.2 billion, $ 1.1 billion and $ 2.0 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nNOTE 9 \n\nOTHER LIABILITIES \n\nThe following is a summary of Other liabilities as of December 31: ##TABLE_START \n\n(Millions) \n\n2022 2021 \n\nMembership Rewards liability \n\n$ 12,789 &#160; $ 11,398 &#160; \n\nDeferred card and other fees, net \n\n3,027 &#160; 2,516 &#160; \n\nEmployee-related liabilities (a) \n\n2,530 &#160; 2,528 &#160; \n\nCard Member rebate and reward accruals (b) \n\n2,126 &#160; 1,809 &#160; \n\nIncome tax liability (c) \n\n1,651 &#160; 1,576 &#160; \n\nOther (d) \n\n15,227 &#160; 10,670 &#160; \n\nTotal \n\n$ 37,350 &#160; $ 30,497 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes employee benefit plan obligations and incentive compensation. \n\n(b) Card Member rebate and reward accruals include payments to third-party reward partners and cash-back rewards. \n\n(c) Includes repatriation tax liability of $ 1,012 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, which represents our remaining obligation under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (Tax Act) to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries, the net position for current federal, state and non-U.S. income tax liabilities, and deferred tax liabilities for foreign jurisdictions. \n\n(d) Primarily includes negative cash balances for accounts without an associated overdraft credit facility, Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, lease liabilities, accruals for general operating expenses, payments to cobrand partners, client incentives and dividends payable. \n\nMEMBERSHIP REWARDS \n\nThe Membership Rewards program allows enrolled Card Members to earn points that can be redeemed for a broad variety of rewards including, but not limited to, travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns. \n\nThe expense for Membership Rewards points is included in Card Member rewards expense. We periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors. \n\nDEFERRED CARD AND OTHER FEES, NET \n\nThe carrying amount of deferred card and other fees, net of deferred direct acquisition costs and reserves for membership cancellations, as of December 31, 2022 was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 \n\nDeferred card and other fees (a) \n\n$ 3,380 &#160; $ 2,838 &#160; Deferred direct acquisition costs ( 173 ) ( 169 ) Reserves for membership cancellations ( 180 ) ( 153 ) Deferred card and other fees, net $ 3,027 &#160; $ 2,516 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes deferred fees for Membership Rewards program participants. \n\nNOTE 10 \n\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nSTOCK OPTION AND AWARD PROGRAMS \n\nUnder our 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (amended and restated effective May 5, 2020) and previously under our 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, Incentive Compensation Plans), awards may be granted to employees and other key individuals who perform services for us and our participating subsidiaries. These awards may be in the form of stock options, restricted stock units or awards (collectively referred to as RSUs) or other incentives or similar awards designed to meet the requirements of non-U.S. jurisdictions. \n\nFor our Incentive Compensation Plans, there were a total of 9 million, 12 million and 14 million common shares unissued and available for grant as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as authorized by our Board of Directors and shareholders. We generally issue new common shares upon exercise of options and vesting of RSUs. \n\nStock-based compensation expense recognized in Salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 373 million, $ 326 million and $ 247 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with corresponding income tax benefits of $ 90 million, $ 78 million and $ 59 million in those respective periods. \n\nA summary of stock option and RSU activity as of December 31, 2022, and corresponding changes during the year, are as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Stock Options Service-Based RSUs Service and Performance-Based RSUs (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Shares Weighted- Average Grant Price Shares Weighted- Average Grant Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 3,104 &#160; $ 93.33 &#160; 1,875 &#160; $ 117.36 &#160; 3,741 &#160; $ 114.22 &#160; Granted 1,168 &#160; 154.57 &#160; 798 &#160; 174.48 &#160; 1,064 &#160; 163.60 &#160; Options exercised/RSUs vested ( 638 ) 88.81 &#160; ( 751 ) 113.19 &#160; ( 1,097 ) 89.58 &#160; Forfeited &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 134 ) 139.77 &#160; ( 236 ) 137.42 &#160; Expired &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 3,634 &#160; 113.80 &#160; 1,788 &#160; $ 142.92 &#160; 3,472 &#160; $ 135.57 &#160; Options vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 3,607 &#160; 113.54 &#160; Options exercisable as of December 31, 2022 1,699 &#160; $ 80.57 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nStock-based compensation expense is generally recognized ratably based on the grant-date fair value of the awards, net of expected forfeitures, over the vesting period. Generally, the vesting period is the shorter of the vesting schedule as defined in each award agreement or the date an individual will become eligible to retire. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and/or years of service. \n\nSTOCK OPTIONS \n\nEach stock option has an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual term of 10 years from the date of grant. \n\nThe fair value of options without market conditions is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for options granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Dividend yield 1.0 &#160; % 1.5 &#160; % 1.4 &#160; % \n\nExpected volatility (a) \n\n31 &#160; % 31 &#160; % 20 &#160; % Risk-free interest rate 1.7 &#160; % 0.8 &#160; % 1.6 &#160; % \n\nExpected life of stock option ( in years ) (b) \n\n7.1 7.2 7.1 Weighted-average fair value per option $ 55.30 &#160; $ 32.38 &#160; $ 25.83 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The expected volatility is based on both weighted historical and implied volatilities of our common stock price. \n\n(b) The expected life of stock options was determined using both historical data and expectations of option exercise behavior. \n\nCertain executives were awarded a grant of stock options on October 31, 2022 that vest, subject to achieving performance and market conditions. These options vest in tranches on the third and fourth anniversaries from the grant date, subject to continued employment through the applicable anniversary, and have a contractual term of seven years . The fair value was estimated at the \n\ngrant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model assuming a dividend yield of 1.4 percent, expected volatility (based on both weighted historical and implied volatilities of our common stock price) of 34 percent, risk-free rate of 3.9 percent and an expected life of seven years , resulting in a fair value of $ 50.10 . \n\nThe weighted-average remaining contractual life and the aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the fair value of our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the option) of the stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2022, were as follows: ##TABLE_START Outstanding Exercisable Vested and Expected to Vest \n\nWeighted-average remaining contractual life (in years) \n\n5.6 3.6 5.6 \n\nAggregate intrinsic value (millions) \n\n$ 131 &#160; $ 114 &#160; $ 131 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 46 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 3.0 years. \n\nFor stock options that were exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020, the intrinsic value, based upon the fair value of our stock price at the date the options were exercised, was $ 56 million, $ 86 million and $ 47 million, respectively; cash received by the Company from the exercise of stock options was $ 56 million, $ 64 million and $ 44 million during those respective periods. The income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to stock option exercises was $ 9 million, $ 14 million and $ 7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS/AWARDS \n\nWe grant RSUs that contain either a) service conditions or b) both service and performance conditions. RSUs containing only service conditions generally vest ratably over three years , or four years for awards granted prior to 2022, beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date. RSUs containing both service and performance conditions generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, and the number of shares earned depends on the achievement of predetermined Company metrics. RSU holders receive dividend equivalents or dividends. \n\nPerformance-based RSUs include a relative total shareholder return (r-TSR) modifier so that our actual shareholder return relative to a comparable peer group is one of the performance conditions that determines the number of shares ultimately issued upon vesting. \n\nThe fair value of RSUs that do not include the r-TSR modifier, including those that contain only service conditions, is measured using our stock price on the grant date. The fair value of service and performance-based RSUs that include the r-TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions in 2022, 2021 and 2020: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 \n\nExpected volatility (a) \n\n42 &#160; % 41 &#160; % 19 &#160; % Risk-free interest rate 1.4 &#160; % 0.2 &#160; % 1.4 &#160; % \n\nRemaining performance period (in years) \n\n2.9 2.9 2.9 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock price. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 247 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 1.7 years. \n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 168.26 , $ 123.66 and $ 124.47 , respectively. \n\nFor RSUs vested during 2022, 2021 and 2020, the total fair value, based upon our stock price at the date the RSUs vested, was $ 323 million, $ 227 million and $ 291 million, respectively. \n\nLIABILITY-BASED AWARDS \n\nOther incentive awards can be settled with cash or equity shares at our discretion and final Compensation and Benefits Committee approval. These awards are generally settled with cash and thus are classified as liabilities; therefore, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and remeasured quarterly as part of compensation expense over the vesting period. Cash paid upon vesting of these awards in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 50 million, $ 53 million and $ 81 million, respectively. \n\nNOTE 11 \n\nRETIREMENT PLANS \n\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT PLANS \n\nWe sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, the principal plan being the Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), a 401(k) savings plan with a profit-sharing component. The RSP is a tax-qualified retirement plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and covers most employees in the United States. The total expense for all defined contribution retirement plans globally was $ 259 million, $ 269 million and $ 267 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS \n\nOur primary defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in the United States and United Kingdom are closed to new entrants and existing participants do not accrue any additional benefits. Some employees outside the United States and United Kingdom are covered by local retirement plans, some of which are funded, while other employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements. We comply with minimum funding requirements in all countries. We also sponsor unfunded other postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance to certain retired U.S. employees. For these plans, the total net benefit was $ 24 million, $ 26 million and $ 8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the unfunded status related to the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans was $ 278 million and $ 414 million, respectively, and is recorded in Other liabilities. \n\nNOTE 12 \n\nCONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS \n\nCONTINGENCIES \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending and potential legal actions, arbitration proceedings, claims, investigations, examinations, regulatory proceedings, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations (collectively, legal proceedings). \n\nBased on our current knowledge, and taking into consideration our litigation-related liabilities, we do not believe we are a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages, it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations. Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below. \n\nOn February 25, 2020, we were named as a defendant in a case filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, captioned Laurelwood Cleaners LLC v. American Express Co., et al. , in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction in California prohibiting American Express from enforcing its anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions and from requiring merchants &#8220;to offer the service of Amex-card acceptance for free.&#8221; The case has been stayed pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings. \n\nOn January 29, 2019, we were named in a putative class action brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Anthony Oliver, et al. v. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company Inc. , in which the plaintiffs are holders of MasterCard, Visa and/or Discover credit cards (but not American Express cards) and allege they paid higher prices as a result of our anti-steering and non-discrimination provisions in violation of federal antitrust law and the antitrust and consumer laws of various states. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other forms of relief. The court dismissed plaintiffs&#8217; federal antitrust claim, numerous state antitrust and consumer protection claims and their unjust enrichment claim. The remaining claims in plaintiffs&#8217; complaint arise under the antitrust laws of 11 states and the consumer protection laws of six states. \n\nOn March 8, 2016, plaintiffs B&#38;R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam&#8217;s Market and Grove Liquors LLC, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a suit, captioned B&#38;R Supermarket, Inc. d/b/a Milam&#8217;s Market, et al. v. Visa Inc., et al. , for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, California&#8217;s Cartwright Act and unjust enrichment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against American Express Company, other credit and charge card networks, other issuing banks and EMVCo, LLC. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, through EMVCo, conspired to shift liability for fraudulent, faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was filed on July 15, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the court denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards, and on May 4, 2017, the California court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On August 28, 2020, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. \n\nIn July 2004, we were named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently transferred to the Eastern District of New York, captioned The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Co., et al. , in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. \n\nIn 2006, Mawarid Investments Limited filed a request for confidential arbitration under the 1998 London Court of International Arbitration Rules in connection with certain claims arising under a shareholders agreement between Mawarid and TRS relating to a joint venture between the parties, Amex (Middle East) BSC(c) (AEME). In 2008, the tribunal rendered a partial award, including a direction that an audit should take place to verify whether acquirer discount revenue related to transactions occurring with airlines located in the Middle East region had been properly allocated to AEME since its inception in 1992. In September 2021, the tribunal rendered a further partial award regarding the location of transactions through non-physical channels. In May 2022, the tribunal further clarified the 2021 partial award and the discount rate that should apply to transactions through non-physical channels. A final award is now expected in 2023. \n\nIn May 2020, we began responding to a review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to sales to small business customers in the United States. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) regarding these sales practices issues, as well as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Consumer Protection Bureau (CFPB) pertaining to its investigation into sales practices related to consumers. In January 2023, the CFPB notified us that its investigation was completed and that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against us at this time. The OCC, DOJ and EDNY reviews and investigations are ongoing and could result in enforcement actions or other regulatory proceedings against us seeking fines or other remedial actions. We are cooperating with all inquiries. \n\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions. While we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting. \n\nOur legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including, but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the damages sought, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss. \n\nWe have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses, as applicable. \n\nFor those disclosed legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to $ 200 million in excess of any accruals related to those matters. This range represents management&#8217;s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals. In addition, it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nCOMMITMENTS \n\nTotal lease expense includes rent expenses, adjustments for rent concessions, rent escalations and leasehold improvement allowances and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Total lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 188 million, $ 161 million and $ 177 million, respectively. \n\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date or upon modification of the lease. For lease liabilities outstanding as of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term was 19 years and the weighted average rate used to discount lease commitments was 3 percent. \n\nThe following represents the maturities of our outstanding lease commitments as of December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START (Millions) &#160; 2023 $ 157 &#160; 2024 144 &#160; 2025 121 &#160; 2026 105 &#160; 2027 93 &#160; Thereafter 892 &#160; Total Outstanding Fixed Lease Payments $ 1,512 &#160; Less: Amount representing interest $ ( 539 ) Lease Liabilities $ 973 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 2.0 billion in financial commitments outstanding related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement, generally ranging from five to ten years . Such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payment we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on Card Members&#8217; spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new Card Members. In the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment, we generally pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points. \n\nNOTE 13 \n\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES \n\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks. These instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes. \n\nMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk exposures include: \n\n&#8226; Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables and investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and \n\n&#8226; Foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \n\nWe centrally monitor market risks using market risk limits and escalation triggers as defined in our Asset/Liability Management Policy. Our market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services. \n\nInterest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate borrowings, as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates such as Prime, the secured overnight financing rate and the overnight indexed swap rate. Interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and deposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to economically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to variable-rate obligations, or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations. We may change the mix between variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors. \n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities, such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which impact earnings. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a spot basis or by hedging this market exposure, to the extent it is economical, through various means, including the use of derivatives such as foreign exchange forwards. \n\nDerivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to, an uncollateralized derivative exposure. We manage this risk by considering the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum potential future exposure of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the underlying or reference index. To mitigate derivative credit risk, counterparties are required to be pre-approved by us and rated as investment grade, and counterparty risk exposures are centrally monitored. \n\nA majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties. Accordingly, where appropriate, we have elected to present derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To further mitigate counterparty credit risk, we exercise our rights under executed credit support agreements with the respective derivative counterparties for our bilateral interest rate swaps and select foreign exchange contracts. These agreements require that, in the event the fair value change in the net derivatives position between the two parties exceeds certain dollar thresholds, the party in the net liability position posts collateral to its counterparty. All derivative contracts cleared through a central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contracts. \n\nIn relation to our credit risk, certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position. As of December 31, 2022, these derivatives were not in a material net liability position and we had no material risk exposure to any individual derivative counterparty. Based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required. \n\nOur derivatives are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in fair value depends on the instruments&#8217; intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as discussed below. Refer to Note 14 for a description of our methodology for determining the fair value of derivatives. \n\nThe following table summarizes the total fair value, excluding interest accruals, of derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31: ##TABLE_START Other Assets Fair Value Other Liabilities Fair Value (Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Fair value hedges - Interest rate contracts (a) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 204 &#160; $ 211 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Net investment hedges - Foreign exchange contracts 350 &#160; 219 &#160; 251 &#160; 54 &#160; Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments 350 &#160; 423 &#160; 462 &#160; 54 &#160; Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts and other \n\n171 &#160; 167 &#160; 339 &#160; 85 &#160; Total derivatives, gross 521 &#160; 590 &#160; 801 &#160; 139 &#160; \n\nDerivative asset and derivative liability netting (b) \n\n( 257 ) ( 93 ) ( 257 ) ( 93 ) \n\nCash collateral netting (c) \n\n( 11 ) ( 204 ) ( 212 ) ( 4 ) Total derivatives, net $ 253 &#160; $ 293 &#160; $ 332 &#160; $ 42 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) For our centrally cleared derivatives, variation margin payments are legally characterized as settlement payments as opposed to collateral. \n\n(b) Represents the amount of netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement. \n\n(c) Represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contracts and certain foreign exchange contracts with the right to cash collateral held from the counterparty or cash collateral posted with the counterparty. \n\nWe posted $ 8 million and $ 11 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swaps; such amounts are recorded within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the derivative balances. \n\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING \n\nDerivatives executed for hedge accounting purposes are documented and designated as such when we enter into the contracts. In accordance with our risk management policies, we structure our hedges with terms similar to those of the item being hedged. We formally assess, at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. These assessments usually are made through the application of a regression analysis method. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, we will discontinue the application of hedge accounting. \n\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES \n\nA fair value hedge involves a derivative designated to hedge our exposure to future changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an identified portion thereof, that is attributable to a particular risk. \n\nInterest Rate Contracts \n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate long-term debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We had $ 8.1 billion and $ 12.9 billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nGains or losses on the fair value hedging instrument principally offset the losses or gains on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The changes in the fair value of the derivative and the changes in the hedged item may not fully offset due to differences between a debt obligation&#8217;s interest rate and the benchmark rate, primarily due to credit spreads at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap. \n\nThe following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START Gains (losses) (Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Fixed-rate long-term debt $ 473 &#160; $ 385 &#160; $ ( 405 ) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments ( 476 ) ( 385 ) 409 &#160; Total $ ( 3 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $ 7.8 billion and $ 13.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments of $( 236 ) million and $ 237 million for the respective periods. \n\nWe recognized in Interest expense on Long-term debt a net decrease of $ 57 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net decreases of $ 256 million for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These were primarily related to the net settlements including interest accruals on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges. \n\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES \n\nA net investment hedge is used to hedge future changes in currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. We primarily designate foreign currency derivatives as net investment hedges to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We had notional amounts of approximately $ 12.5 billion and $ 12.6 billion of foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, were gains of $ 237 million and $ 176 million and losses of $ 253 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net investment hedge reclassifications out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Income were no t significant for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES \n\nWe have derivatives that act as economic hedges, but are not designated as such for hedge accounting purposes. Foreign currency transactions from time to time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contracts, primarily foreign exchange forwards. These hedges generally mature within one year. Foreign currency contracts involve the purchase and sale of designated currencies at an agreed upon rate for settlement on a specified date. \n\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. We had notional amounts of approximately $ 21.7 billion and $ 19.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in a net gain of $ 8 million, a net loss of $ 21 million and a net gain of $ 10 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that are recognized in Other, net expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nIn 2022, we recorded an embedded derivative with a notional amount of $ 78 million, related to seller earnout shares granted to us upon the completion of a business combination between our equity method investee, Global Business Travel Group, and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. This embedded derivative had a fair value of $ 27 million as of December 31, 2022. The changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative resulted in gains of $ 4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which were recognized in Service fees and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nNOTE 14 \n\nFAIR VALUES \n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be required to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. \n\nGAAP provides for a three-level hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 &#8213; Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access. \n\n&#8226; Level 2 &#8213; Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, including: \n\n&#8211; Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; \n\n&#8211; Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; \n\n&#8211; Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and \n\n&#8211; Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. \n\n&#8226; Level 3 &#8213; Inputs that are unobservable and reflect our own estimates about the estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances (e.g., internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount of expected cash flows). \n\nWe monitor the market conditions and evaluate the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no Level 3 transfers. \n\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE \n\nThe following table summarizes our financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, categorized by GAAP&#8217;s fair value hierarchy (as described in the preceding paragraphs), as of December 31: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (Millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: \n\nInvestment securities: (a) \n\nEquity securities $ 41 &#160; $ 40 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 79 &#160; $ 78 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Debt securities 4,537 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,490 &#160; 47 &#160; 2,512 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,480 &#160; 32 &#160; \n\nDerivatives, gross (a)(b) \n\n521 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 494 &#160; 27 &#160; 590 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 590 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total Assets 5,099 &#160; 40 &#160; 4,985 &#160; 74 &#160; 3,181 &#160; 78 &#160; 3,071 &#160; 32 &#160; Liabilities: \n\nDerivatives, gross (a) \n\n801 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 801 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 139 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 139 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total Liabilities $ 801 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 801 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 139 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 139 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Refer to Note 4 for the fair values of investment securities and to Note 13 for the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, on a further disaggregated basis. \n\n(b) Level 3 fair value reflects an embedded derivative. Management reviews and applies judgment to the valuation of the embedded derivative that is performed by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo simulation that models a range of probable future stock prices based on implied volatility in a risk neutral framework. Refer to Note 13 for additional information about this embedded derivative. \n\nVALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE \n\nFor the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table above), we apply the following valuation techniques: \n\nInvestment Securities \n\nWhen available, quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are used to estimate fair value. Such investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nWhen quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are not available, the fair values for our investment securities are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by us, and we receive one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. Such investment securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services. \n\nWe reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services by comparing them to alternative pricing sources. In instances where price discrepancies are identified between different pricing sources, we evaluate such discrepancies to ensure that the prices used for our valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment securities. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on investment securities. \n\nWithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are our holdings of debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions. We take the carrying value for these investment securities to be a reasonable proxy for their fair value unless we determine, based on our internal credit model, that there are indicators that the contractual cash flows will not be received in full. \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments \n\nThe fair value of our Level 2 derivative financial instruments is estimated by using third-party pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from active markets. The pricing models used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives as described below. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques at least annually and validate the valuation output on a quarterly basis. \n\nThe fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the swap such as the notional amount, fixed coupon rate, floating coupon rate and tenor, as well as discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. \n\nThe fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the forward contracts such as the notional amount, maturity dates and contract rate, as well as relevant foreign currency forward curves, and discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated. \n\nOur Level 3 derivative financial instrument represents an embedded derivative in the form of seller earnout shares granted to us following the completion of a business combination between our equity method investee, Global Business Travel Group, and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. The fair valuation is performed by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo Simulation technique that models a range of probable future stock prices using the following significant inputs: term of the earnout, initial stock price, annual expected volatility of the common stock over the expected term, annual risk-neutral rate of return over the contractual term and dividend yield, which is further reviewed by management. \n\nCredit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters, such as a benchmark curve, used to value derivatives are not indicative of our credit quality or that of our counterparties. We consider the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on derivative financial instruments. \n\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE \n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at amortized cost, and not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The fair values of these financial instruments are estimates based upon the market conditions and perceived risks as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and require management&#8217;s judgment. These figures may not be indicative of future fair values, nor can the fair value of American Express be estimated by aggregating the amounts presented. ##TABLE_START \n\n2022 (Billions) \n\nCarrying Value Corresponding Fair Value Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial Assets: Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value Cash and cash equivalents (a) \n\n$ 34 &#160; $ 34 &#160; $ 32 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other financial assets (b) \n\n60 &#160; 60 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 60 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Financial assets carried at other than fair value Card Member and Other loans, less reserves (c) \n\n110 &#160; 113 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 113 &#160; Financial Liabilities: Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value 123 &#160; 123 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 123 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value Certificates of deposit (d) \n\n16 &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-term debt (c) \n\n$ 43 &#160; $ 42 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 42 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n2021 (Billions) \n\nCarrying Value Corresponding Fair Value Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial Assets: Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value Cash and cash equivalents (a) \n\n$ 22 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other financial assets (b) \n\n56 &#160; 56 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 56 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Financial assets carried at other than fair value Card Member and Other loans, less reserves (c) \n\n88 &#160; 91 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 91 &#160; Financial Liabilities: Financial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value 105 &#160; 105 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 105 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value Certificates of deposit (d) \n\n5 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Long-term debt (c) \n\n$ 39 &#160; $ 40 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 40 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Level 2 fair value amounts reflect time deposits and short-term investments. \n\n(b) Balances include &#160; Card Member receivables (including fair values of Card Member receivables of $ 5.2 billion held by a consolidated VIE as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021), other receivables and other miscellaneous assets. \n\n(c) Balances include amounts held by a consolidated VIE for which the fair values of Card Member loans were $ 28.4 billion and $ 26.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the fair values of Long-term debt were $ 12.3 billion and $ 13.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n(d) Presented as a component of Customer deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nVALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT OTHER THAN FAIR VALUE \n\nFor the financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table), we apply the following valuation techniques to measure fair value: \n\nFinancial Assets For Which Carrying Values Equal Or Approximate Fair Value \n\nFinancial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include cash and cash equivalents, Card Member receivables, accrued interest and certain other assets. For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate. \n\nFinancial Assets Carried At Other Than Fair Value \n\nCard Member and Other loans, less reserves \n\nCard Member and Other loans are recorded at historical cost, less reserves, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair value for our loans, we use a discounted cash flow model. Due to the lack of a comparable whole loan sales market for similar loans and the lack of observable pricing inputs thereof, we use various inputs to estimate fair value. Such inputs include projected income, discount rates and forecasted write-offs. The valuation does not include economic value attributable to future receivables generated by the accounts associated with the loans. \n\nFinancial Liabilities For Which Carrying Values Equal Or Approximate Fair Value \n\nFinancial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value include accrued interest, customer deposits (excluding certificates of deposit, which are described further below), Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products outstanding, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities for which the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate. \n\nFinancial Liabilities Carried At Other Than Fair Value \n\nCertificates of Deposit \n\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the current market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets. \n\nLong-term Debt \n\nLong-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized discount and unamortized fees, (ii) the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and (iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes that have been swapped to floating rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads, bond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. \n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nWe have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. \n\nWe estimate the Level 3 fair value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values based on price changes as of the date of new similar equity financing transactions completed by the companies in our portfolio. Impairments on such investments are recorded to account for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of an investment based on a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators such as business performance, general market conditions and the economic and regulatory environment. When an impairment triggering event occurs, the fair value measurement is generally derived by taking into account all available information, such as share prices of publicly traded peer companies, internal valuations performed by our investees, and other third-party fair value data. The fair value of impaired investments represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. The carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $ 0.6 billion represented a nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurement for certain of our equity investments. There were no nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements related to our equity investments without readily determinable fair values as of December 31, 2021. These amounts are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded unrealized gains of $ 94 million, $ 729 million and $ 113 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unrealized losses representing impairments were $ 388 million, $ 2 million and $ 20 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Since the adoption of new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities on January 1, 2018, cumulative unrealized gains for equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and cumulative unrealized losses representing impairments were $ 394 million and $ 10 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nIn addition, we also have certain equity investments measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient. Such investments were immaterial as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nNOTE 15 \n\nGUARANTEES \n\nThe maximum potential undiscounted future payments and related liability resulting from guarantees and indemnifications provided by us in the ordinary course of business were $ 1 billion and $ 21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $ 1 billion and $ 24 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, all of which were primarily related to our real estate arrangements and business dispositions. \n\nTo date, we have not experienced any significant losses related to guarantees or indemnifications. Our recognition of these instruments is at fair value. In addition, we establish reserves when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. \n\nNOTE 16 \n\nCOMMON AND PREFERRED SHARES \n\nThe following table shows authorized shares and provides a reconciliation of common shares issued and outstanding for the years ended December 31: ##TABLE_START (Millions, except where indicated) 2022 2021 2020 \n\nCommon shares authorized (billions) (a) \n\n3.6 &#160; 3.6 &#160; 3.6 &#160; Shares issued and outstanding at beginning of year 761 &#160; 805 &#160; 810 &#160; Repurchases of common shares ( 20 ) ( 46 ) ( 7 ) Other, primarily stock option exercises and restricted stock awards granted 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Shares issued and outstanding as of December 31 743 &#160; 761 &#160; 805 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Of the common shares authorized but unissued as of December 31, 2022, approximately 18 million shares are reserved for issuance under employee stock and employee benefit plans. \n\nOn September 23, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million common shares from time to time, subject to market conditions and in accordance with our capital plans. This authorization replaced the prior repurchase authorization and does not have an expiration date. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 20 million common shares with a cost basis of $ 3.3 billion, 46 million common shares with a cost basis of $ 7.6 billion, and 7 million common shares with a cost basis of $ 0.9 billion, respectively. The cost basis includes commissions paid of $ 4.2 million, $ 5.6 million and $ 1.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 36 million common shares remaining under the Board share repurchase authorization. \n\nCommon shares are generally retired by us upon repurchase (except for 2.4 million shares held as treasury shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2.5 million shares held as treasury shares as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020); retired common shares and treasury shares are excluded from the shares outstanding in the table above. The treasury shares, with a cost basis of $ 262 million, $ 271 million and $ 279 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital in Shareholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nPREFERRED SHARES \n\nThe Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of up to 20 million preferred shares at a par value of $1.66 2/3 per share without further shareholder approval. We have the following perpetual Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Share series issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022: ##TABLE_START &#160; Series D Issuance date August 3, 2021 Securities issued 1,600 Preferred shares; represented by 1,600,000 depositary shares \n\nDividend rate per annum 3.55 % through September 14, 2026; resets September 15, 2026 and every subsequent 5-year anniversary at 5-year Treasury rate plus 2.854 % \n\nDividend payment date Quarterly beginning September 15, 2021 \n\nEarliest redemption date \n\nSeptember 15, 2026 Aggregate liquidation preference $ 1,600 million \n\nCarrying value (a) \n\n$ 1,584 million ##TABLE_END \n\n(a) Carrying value, presented in the Statements of Shareholders' Equity, represents the issuance proceeds, net of underwriting fees and offering costs. \n\nIn the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the preferred shares then outstanding take precedence over our common shares for the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets out of funds legally available for distribution to shareholders. We may redeem the outstanding series of preferred shares at $ 1 million per preferred share (equivalent to $ 1,000 per depositary share) plus any declared but unpaid dividends in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after the earliest redemption date, or in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of certain bank regulatory changes. \n\nIn 2021, we paid $ 1.6 billion to redeem in full the previously outstanding Series B and Series C preferred shares. The difference between the redemption value and carrying value of the redeemed Series B and Series C preferred shares resulted in a $ 16 million reduction to net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nThere were no warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nNOTE 17 \n\nCHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) \n\nAOCI is a balance sheet item in Shareholders&#8217; equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. It is comprised of items that have not been recognized in earnings but may be recognized in earnings in the future when certain events occur.

In connection with these programs, we will typically incur severance and other exit costs. \n\nWe had $ 135 million, $ 67 million and $ 197 million accrued in total restructuring reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restructuring expense , which primarily relates to new severance charges, net of revisions to existing reserves, was $ 142 million, $( 10 ) million and $ 125 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cumulative expense relating to the restructuring programs that were in progress during 2022 and initiated at various dates between 2019 and 2022 was $ 270 million, the majority of which has been reflected within Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nNOTE 20 \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nThe components of income tax expense for the years ended December 31 included in the Consolidated Statements of Income were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current income tax expense: U.S. federal $ 2,445 &#160; $ 1,656 &#160; $ 1,122 &#160; U.S. state and local 339 &#160; 351 &#160; 339 &#160; Non-U.S. 476 &#160; 328 &#160; 639 &#160; Total current income tax expense 3,260 &#160; 2,335 &#160; 2,100 &#160; Deferred income tax (benefit) expense: U.S. federal ( 763 ) 231 &#160; ( 931 ) U.S. state and local ( 117 ) 22 &#160; ( 119 ) Non-U.S. ( 309 ) 41 &#160; 111 &#160; Total deferred income tax (benefit) expense ( 1,189 ) 294 &#160; ( 939 ) Total income tax expense $ 2,071 &#160; $ 2,629 &#160; $ 1,161 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 percent as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, to our actual income tax rate was as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % (Decrease) increase in taxes resulting from: Tax credits and tax-exempt income (a) \n\n( 0.9 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 4.1 ) State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.1 &#160; 3.0 &#160; 3.7 &#160; Non-U.S. subsidiaries' earnings \n\n( 0.1 ) 1.1 &#160; 2.4 &#160; Tax settlements and lapse of statute of limitations \n\n( 2.1 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 1.6 ) Valuation allowances ( 0.1 ) &#8212; &#160; 4.0 &#160; Other 0.7 &#160; ( 0.1 ) 1.6 &#160; Actual tax rates 21.6 &#160; % 24.6 &#160; % 27.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes the implementation of PAM related to investments in QAH projects for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nWe record a deferred income tax (benefit) provision when there are differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and for income tax return purposes. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. \n\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are reflected in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Reserves not yet deducted for tax purposes $ 4,052 &#160; $ 3,637 &#160; Employee compensation and benefits 353 &#160; 359 &#160; Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 411 &#160; 398 &#160; Other 776 &#160; 809 &#160; Gross deferred tax assets 5,592 &#160; 5,203 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 537 ) ( 472 ) Deferred tax assets after valuation allowance 5,055 &#160; 4,731 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Intangibles and fixed assets 671 &#160; 1,320 &#160; Deferred revenue 126 &#160; 189 &#160; Deferred interest 118 &#160; 133 &#160; Investment in joint ventures 17 &#160; 183 &#160; Other 618 &#160; 521 &#160; Gross deferred tax liabilities 1,550 &#160; 2,346 &#160; Net deferred tax assets $ 3,505 &#160; $ 2,385 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe net operating loss and tax credit carryforward balance as of December 31, 2022, shown in the table above, is related to pre-tax U.S. federal and non-U.S. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $ 27 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, and foreign tax credit (FTC) carryforwards of $ 121 million. If not utilized, certain U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2023 and 2037, whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2030 and 2032. \n\nA valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowances for both periods presented above are associated with certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, state NOLs, and FTC carryforwards. \n\nAccumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which totaled approximately $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. We do not provide for state income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Accordingly, state income and foreign withholding taxes, which would have aggregated to approximately $ 0.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, have not been provided on those earnings. \n\nNet income taxes paid by us during 2022, 2021 and 2020, were approximately $ 3.0 billion, $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.2 billion, respectively. These amounts include estimated tax payments and cash settlements relating to prior tax years. \n\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer&#8217;s facts is sometimes open to interpretation. Given these inherent complexities, we must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. A tax position is recognized only when, based on management&#8217;s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. The amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on management&#8217;s best judgment of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement with the taxing authority given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We adjust the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome. \n\nWe are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and tax authorities in other countries and states in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. \n\nThe following table presents changes in unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START (Millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance, January 1 $ 1,024 &#160; $ 790 &#160; $ 726 &#160; Increases: Current year tax positions 119 &#160; 64 &#160; 57 &#160; Tax positions related to prior years 30 &#160; 225 &#160; 105 &#160; Effects of foreign currency translations &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Decreases: Tax positions related to prior years \n\n( 30 ) ( 14 ) ( 24 ) Settlements with tax authorities \n\n( 74 ) ( 15 ) ( 15 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 104 ) ( 17 ) ( 58 ) Effects of foreign currency translations ( 3 ) ( 9 ) ( 1 ) Balance, December 31 $ 962 &#160; $ 1,024 &#160; $ 790 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIncluded in the unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1.0 billion, $ 1.0 billion and $ 0.8 billion for December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are approximately $ 750 million, $ 780 million and $ 580 million, respectively, that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in a future period. \n\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next twelve months by as much as $ 150 million, principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years&#8217; tax items with various taxing authorities. The prior years&#8217; tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Of the $ 150 million of unrecognized tax benefits, approximately $ 118 million relates to amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in a future period. \n\nInterest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in the income tax provision. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $ 10 million, $ 40 million and $ 260 million, respectively, in expenses for interest and penalties. \n\nWe had approximately $ 380 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021 . \n\nNOTE 21 \n\nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (EPS) \n\nThe computations of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31 were as follows: ##TABLE_START \n\n(Millions, except per share amounts) \n\n2022 2021 2020 \n\nNumerator: \n\nBasic and diluted: \n\nNet income \n\n$ 7,514 &#160; $ 8,060 &#160; $ 3,135 &#160; Preferred dividends ( 57 ) ( 71 ) ( 79 ) Equity-related adjustments (a) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 16 ) &#8212; &#160; Net income available to common shareholders 7,457 &#160; 7,973 &#160; 3,056 &#160; Earnings allocated to participating share awards (b) \n\n( 57 ) ( 56 ) ( 20 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders \n\n$ 7,400 &#160; $ 7,917 &#160; $ 3,036 &#160; \n\nDenominator: (b) \n\nBasic: Weighted-average common stock \n\n751 &#160; 789 &#160; 805 &#160; Add: Weighted-average stock options (c) \n\n1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Diluted \n\n752 &#160; 790 &#160; 806 &#160; \n\nBasic EPS \n\n$ 9.86 &#160; $ 10.04 &#160; $ 3.77 &#160; Diluted EPS $ 9.85 &#160; $ 10.02 &#160; $ 3.77 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents the difference between the redemption value and carrying value of the Series C and Series B preferred shares, which were redeemed on September 15, 2021 and November 15, 2021, respectively. The carrying value represents the original issuance proceeds, net of underwriting fees and offering costs for the preferred shares. \n\n(b) Our unvested restricted stock awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The related participating securities are similarly excluded from the denominator. \n\n(c) The dilutive effect of unexercised stock options excludes from the computation of EPS 0.39 million, 0.01 million and 0.53 million of options for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because inclusion of the options would have been anti-dilutive. \n\nNOTE 22 \n\nREGULATORY MATTERS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY \n\nWe are supervised and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) and are subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s requirements for risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), is subject to supervision and regulation, including regulatory capital and leverage requirements, by the OCC. \n\nUnder the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on-balance sheet assets). \n\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary actions by regulators, that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our operating activities. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we met all capital requirements to which we were subject and maintained regulatory capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as well capitalized. \n\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital ratios: ##TABLE_START (Millions, except percentages) CET 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital CET 1 capital ratio Tier 1 capital ratio Total capital ratio Tier 1 leverage ratio \n\nDecember 31, 2022: (a) \n\nAmerican Express Company $ 20,030 &#160; $ 21,627 &#160; $ 24,926 &#160; 10.3 &#160; % 11.1 &#160; % 12.8 &#160; % 9.9 &#160; % American Express National Bank $ 14,820 &#160; $ 14,820 &#160; $ 17,273 &#160; 11.3 &#160; % 11.3 &#160; % 13.2 &#160; % 9.7 &#160; % \n\nDecember 31, 2021: (a) \n\nAmerican Express Company $ 17,554 &#160; $ 19,186 &#160; $ 21,506 &#160; 10.5 &#160; % 11.5 &#160; % 12.9 &#160; % 10.5 &#160; % American Express National Bank $ 13,085 &#160; $ 13,085 &#160; $ 15,283 &#160; 11.8 &#160; % 11.8 &#160; % 13.7 &#160; % 10.5 &#160; % \n\nWell-capitalized ratios (b) \n\nAmerican Express Company N/A 6.0 &#160; % 10.0 &#160; % N/A American Express National Bank 6.5 &#160; % 8.0 &#160; % 10.0 &#160; % 5.0 &#160; % \n\nMinimum capital ratios (c) \n\n4.5 &#160; % 6.0 &#160; % 8.0 &#160; % 4.0 &#160; % \n\nEffective Minimum (d) \n\nAmerican Express Company 7.0 &#160; % 8.5 &#160; % 10.5 &#160; % 4.0 &#160; % American Express National Bank 7.0 &#160; % 8.5 &#160; % 10.5 &#160; % 4.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Capital ratios reported using Basel III capital definitions and risk-weighted assets using the Basel III standardized approach. \n\n(b) Represents requirements for bank holding companies and banking subsidiaries to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; pursuant to regulations issued under the Federal Reserve Regulation Y and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, respectively. There is no CET1 capital ratio or Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement for a bank holding company to be considered &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; \n\n(c) As defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and OCC. \n\n(d) Represents Basel III minimum capital requirement and applicable regulatory buffers as defined by the federal banking regulators, which includes the stress capital buffer for American Express Company and the capital conservation buffer for American Express National Bank. \n\nRESTRICTED NET ASSETS OF SUBSIDIARIES \n\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the transfer of net assets under debt agreements and regulatory requirements. These restrictions have not had any effect on our shareholder dividend policy and management does not anticipate any impact in the future. Procedures exist to transfer net assets between the Company and its subsidiaries, while ensuring compliance with the various contractual and regulatory constraints. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of net assets of subsidiaries that are restricted to be transferred was approximately $ 12.0 billion. \n\nBANK HOLDING COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS \n\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends by the Federal Reserve, which could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan. \n\nBANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS \n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $ 4.6 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. \n\nNOTE 23 \n\nSIGNIFICANT CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS \n\nConcentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to American Express&#8217; total credit exposure. Our customers operate in diverse industries, economic sectors and geographic regions. \n\nThe following table details our maximum credit exposure of the on-balance sheet assets by category as of December 31: ##TABLE_START (Billions) 2022 2021 \n\nIndividuals: (a) \n\n$ 156 &#160; $ 131 &#160; United States 129 &#160; 108 &#160; Outside the United States (b) \n\n27 &#160; 23 &#160; \n\nInstitutions: \n\nFinancial services (c) \n\n36 &#160; 24 &#160; Other (d) \n\n17 &#160; 15 &#160; \n\nU.S. Government and agencies (e) \n\n4 &#160; 2 &#160; Total on-balance sheet $ 213 &#160; $ 172 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily reflects loans and receivables from global consumer and small business Card Members, which are governed by individual credit risk management. \n\n(b) The geographic regions with the largest concentration outside the United States include the United Kingdom, Japan, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Mexico. \n\n(c) Represents banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and savings and loan associations, which are governed by institutional credit risk management. \n\n(d) Primarily reflects loans and receivables from global corporate Card Members, which are governed by institutional credit risk management. \n\n(e) Represent debt obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies, states and municipalities and government-sponsored entities. Risk management for these balances is governed by our Asset and Liability Management Committee. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our most significant concentration of credit risk was with individuals. These amounts are generally advanced on an unsecured basis. However, we review each potential customer&#8217;s credit application and evaluate the applicant&#8217;s financial history and ability and willingness to repay. We also consider credit performance by customer tenure, industry and geographic location in managing credit exposure. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $ 350 billion and $ 327 billion, respectively of unused credit, primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements, of which approximately 80 percent was related to customers within the United States in both periods. Total unused credit does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit. \n\nNOTE 24 \n\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS \n\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS \n\nWe consider a combination of factors when evaluating the composition of our reportable operating segments, including the results reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, economic characteristics, products and services offered, classes of customers, product distribution channels, geographic considerations (primarily United States versus outside the United States), and regulatory environment considerations. \n\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, we updated the methodology used to allocate certain revenues; prior period amounts have been recast to conform to current period presentation. \n\nEffective for the third quarter of 2022, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2022. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the new reportable operating segments. \n\nThe following is a brief description of the primary business activities of our four new reportable operating segments: \n\n&#8226; U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), which issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products. \n\n&#8226; Commercial Services (CS), which issues a wide range of proprietary corporate and small business cards and provides services to U.S. businesses, including payment and expense management, banking and non-card financing products. CS also issues proprietary corporate cards and provides services to select global corporate clients. \n\n&#8226; International Card Services (ICS), which issues a wide range of proprietary consumer, small business and corporate cards outside the United States. ICS also provides services to our international customers, including travel and lifestyle services, and manages certain international joint ventures and our loyalty coalition businesses. \n\n&#8226; Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS), which operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers (including our network partnership agreements in China), merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. \n\nCorporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &#38; Other. \n\nThe following table presents certain selected financial information for our reportable operating segments and Corporate &#38; Other as of or for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: ##TABLE_START (Millions, except where indicated) USCS CS ICS GMNS Corporate &#38; Other (a) \n\nConsolidated 2022 Total non-interest revenues $ 16,440 &#160; $ 12,196 &#160; $ 8,262 &#160; $ 6,123 &#160; $ ( 54 ) $ 42,967 &#160; Revenue from contracts with customers (b) \n\n12,478 &#160; 10,844 &#160; 5,301 &#160; 5,603 &#160; ( 7 ) 34,219 &#160; Interest income 8,457 &#160; 2,070 &#160; 1,453 &#160; 23 &#160; 655 &#160; 12,658 &#160; Interest expense 983 &#160; 697 &#160; 654 &#160; ( 329 ) 758 &#160; 2,763 &#160; Total revenues net of interest expense 23,914 &#160; 13,569 &#160; 9,061 &#160; 6,475 &#160; ( 157 ) 52,862 &#160; Pretax income (loss) 5,400 &#160; 2,880 &#160; 578 &#160; 2,954 &#160; ( 2,227 ) 9,585 &#160; \n\nTotal assets (billions) \n\n$ 94 &#160; $ 51 &#160; $ 37 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 228 &#160; 2021 Total non-interest revenues $ 12,989 &#160; $ 9,833 &#160; $ 6,761 &#160; $ 5,021 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 34,630 &#160; Revenue from contracts with customers (b) \n\n9,823 &#160; 8,659 &#160; 4,368 &#160; 4,694 &#160; 172 &#160; 27,716 &#160; Interest income 6,328 &#160; 1,408 &#160; 1,116 &#160; 16 &#160; 165 &#160; 9,033 &#160; Interest expense 395 &#160; 330 &#160; 442 &#160; ( 92 ) 208 &#160; 1,283 &#160; Total revenues net of interest expense 18,922 &#160; 10,911 &#160; 7,435 &#160; 5,129 &#160; ( 17 ) 42,380 &#160; Pretax income (loss) 5,958 &#160; 2,936 &#160; 929 &#160; 1,874 &#160; ( 1,008 ) 10,689 &#160; \n\nTotal assets (billions) \n\n$ 77 &#160; $ 45 &#160; $ 33 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 189 &#160; 2020 Total non-interest revenues $ 10,125 &#160; $ 8,210 &#160; $ 5,877 &#160; $ 4,209 &#160; $ ( 319 ) $ 28,102 &#160; Revenue from contracts with customers (b) \n\n7,261 &#160; 7,123 &#160; 3,663 &#160; 3,948 &#160; ( 21 ) 21,974 &#160; Interest income 7,009 &#160; 1,532 &#160; 1,244 &#160; 18 &#160; 280 &#160; 10,083 &#160; Interest expense 787 &#160; 508 &#160; 379 &#160; ( 82 ) 506 &#160; 2,098 &#160; Total revenues net of interest expense 16,347 &#160; 9,234 &#160; 6,742 &#160; 4,309 &#160; ( 545 ) 36,087 &#160; Pretax income (loss) 3,103 &#160; 1,013 &#160; 521 &#160; 1,294 &#160; ( 1,635 ) 4,296 &#160; \n\nTotal assets (billions) \n\n$ 65 &#160; $ 35 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 14 &#160; $ 49 &#160; $ 191 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Corporate &#38; Other includes adjustments and eliminations for intersegment activity. \n\n(b) Includes discount revenue, certain service fees and other revenue and processed revenues from customers. \n\nTotal Revenues Net of Interest Expense \n\nWe allocate discount revenue and certain other revenues among segments using a transfer pricing methodology. Within the USCS, CS and ICS segments, discount revenue generally reflects the issuer component of the overall discount revenue generated by each segment&#8217;s Card Members; within the GMNS segment, discount revenue generally reflects the network and acquirer component of the overall discount revenue being allocated. \n\nNet card fees, processed revenue and certain other revenues are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. \n\nInterest and fees on loans and certain investment income is directly attributable to the segment in which it is reported. Interest expense represents an allocated funding cost based on a combination of segment funding requirements and internal funding rates. \n\nProvisions for Credit Losses \n\nThe provisions for credit losses are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. \n\nExpenses \n\nCard Member rewards and Card Member services expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Business development and Marketing expenses are included in each segment based on the actual expenses incurred. Global brand advertising is primarily allocated to the segments based on the relative levels of revenue. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits and other expenses reflect both costs incurred directly within each segment, as well as allocated expenses. The allocated expenses include service costs, which primarily reflect salaries and benefits associated with our technology and customer servicing groups, and overhead expenses. Service costs are allocated based on activities directly attributable to the segment, and overhead expenses are allocated based on the relative levels of revenue and Card Member loans and receivables. \n\nGEOGRAPHIC OPERATIONS \n\nThe following table presents our total revenues net of interest expense and pretax income (loss) from continuing operations in different geographic regions based, in part, upon internal allocations, which necessarily involve management&#8217;s judgment. \n\nEffective for the first quarter of 2022, we changed the way in which we allocate certain overhead expenses by geographic region. As a result, prior period pretax income (loss) from continuing operations by geography has been recast to conform to current period presentation; there was no impact at a consolidated level. \n\n##TABLE_START (Millions) United States EMEA (a) \n\nAPAC (a) \n\nLACC (a) \n\nOther Unallocated (b) \n\nConsolidated 2022 Total revenues net of interest expense $ 41,396 &#160;
