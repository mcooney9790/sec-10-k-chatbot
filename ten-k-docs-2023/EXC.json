The separation was completed on February 1, 2022, creating two publicly traded companies, Exelon and Constellation. See Note 2 &#8211; Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_START Name of Registrant &#160; Business &#160; Service Territories Commonwealth Edison Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity Northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago Transmission and distribution of electricity to retail customers PECO Energy Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and natural gas Southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia (electricity) Transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas to retail customers Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia (natural gas) Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and natural gas Central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore (electricity and natural gas) Transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas to retail customers Pepco Holdings LLC Utility services holding company engaged, through its reportable segments: Pepco, DPL, and ACE Service Territories of Pepco, DPL, and ACE Potomac Electric Power Company &#160; Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity &#160; District of Columbia and Major portions of Montgomery and Prince George&#8217;s Counties, Maryland Transmission and distribution of electricity to retail customers Delmarva Power &#38; Light Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and natural gas Portions of Delaware and Maryland (electricity) Transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas to retail customers Portions of New Castle County, Delaware (natural gas) Atlantic City Electric Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity Portions of Southern New Jersey Transmission and distribution of electricity to retail customers ##TABLE_END\n\nBusiness Services \n\nThrough its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology, and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, finance, engineering, customer operations, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating companies. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon&#8217;s corporate operations are presented as &#8220;Other&#8221; within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed. \n\nUtility Registrants \n\nUtility Operations \n\nService Territories and Franchise Agreements \n\nThe following table presents the size of service territories, populations of each service territory, and the number of customers within each service territory for the Utility Registrants as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START ComEd PECO BGE Pepco DPL ACE Service Territories (in square miles) Electric 11,450 1,900 2,300 650 5,400 2,750 Natural Gas N/A 1,900 3,050 N/A 250 N/A Total (a) \n\n11,450 2,100 3,250 650 5,400 2,750 Service Territory Population (in millions) Electric 9.3 4.1 3.0 2.4 1.5 1.2 Natural Gas N/A 2.5 2.9 N/A 0.6 N/A Total (b) \n\n9.3 4.1 3.2 2.4 1.5 1.2 Main City Chicago Philadelphia Baltimore District of Columbia Wilmington Atlantic City Main City Population 2.7 1.6 0.6 0.7 0.1 0.1 Number of Customers (in millions) Electric 4.1 1.7 1.3 0.9 0.5 0.6 Natural Gas N/A 0.5 0.7 N/A 0.1 N/A Total (c) \n\n4.1 1.7 1.3 0.9 0.5 0.6 ##TABLE_END ___________ \n\n(a) The number of total service territory square miles counts once only a square mile that includes both electric and natural gas services, and thus does not represent the combined total square mileage of electric and natural gas service territories. \n\n(b) The total service territory population counts once only an individual who lives in a region that includes both electric and natural gas services, and thus does not represent the combined total population of electric and natural gas service territories. \n\n(c) The number of total customers counts once only a customer who is both an electric and a natural gas customer, and thus does not represent the combined total of electric customers and natural gas customers. \n\nThe Utility Registrants have the necessary authorizations to perform their current business of providing regulated electric and natural gas distribution services in the various municipalities and territories in which they now supply such services. These authorizations include charters, franchises, permits, and certificates of public convenience issued by local and state governments and state utility commissions. ComEd's, BGE's (gas), Pepco DC's, and ACE's rights are generally non-exclusive while PECO's, BGE's (electric), Pepco MD's, and DPL's rights are generally exclusive. Certain authorizations are perpetual while others have varying expiration dates. The Utility Registrants anticipate working with the appropriate governmental bodies to extend or replace the authorizations prior to their expirations. \n\nUtility Regulations \n\nState utility commissions regulate the Utility Registrants' electric and gas distribution rates and service, issuances of certain securities, and certain other aspects of the business. The following table outlines the state commissions responsible for utility oversight: \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant Commission ComEd ICC PECO PAPUC BGE MDPSC Pepco DCPSC/MDPSC DPL DEPSC/MDPSC ACE NJBPU ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Utility Registrants are public utilities under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC related to transmission rates and certain other aspects of the utilities' business. The U.S. Department of Transportation also regulates pipeline safety and other areas of gas operations for PECO, BGE, and DPL. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) provided new security directives in 2021 that regulate cyber risks for certain gas distribution operators. Additionally, the Utility Registrants are subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards, which protect the nation's bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. \n\nSeasonality Impacts on Delivery Volumes \n\nThe Utility Registrants' electric distribution volumes are generally higher during the summer and winter months when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. For PECO, BGE, and DPL, natural gas distribution volumes are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating. \n\nComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE have electric distribution decoupling mechanisms and BGE has a natural gas decoupling mechanism that eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on electric distribution and natural gas delivery volumes. As a result, ComEd's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL Maryland's, and ACE's electric distribution revenues and BGE's natural gas distribution revenues are not materially impacted by delivery volumes. PECO's and DPL Delaware's electric distribution revenues and natural gas distribution revenues are impacted by delivery volumes. \n\nElectric and Natural Gas Distribution Services \n\nThe Utility Registrants are allowed to recover reasonable costs and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject to commission approval. ComEd recovers costs through a performance-based rate formula. ComEd is required to file an update to the performance-based rate formula on an annual basis. On September 15, 2021, Illinois passed CEJA, which contains requirements for ComEd to transition away from the performance-based rate formula by the end of 2022 and would allow for the submission of either a general rate or multi-year rate plan. On February 3, 2022, the ICC approved a tariff that establishes the process under which ComEd will reconcile its 2022 and 2023 rate year revenue requirements with actual costs. ComEd filed a petition with the ICC seeking approval of a multi-year rate plan (MRP) for 2024-2027 on January 17, 2023. PECO's and DPL's electric and gas distribution costs and ACE's electric distribution costs have generally been recovered through rate case proceedings, with PECO utilizing a fully projected future test year while DPL and ACE utilize a historical test year. BGE&#8217;s electric and gas distribution costs and Pepco&#8217;s and DPL Maryland's electric distribution costs are currently recovered through multi-year rate case proceedings, as the MDPSC and the DCPSC allow utilities to file multi-year rate plans. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by their respective regulatory agencies. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO and BGE customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. DPL customers, with the exception of certain commercial and industrial customers, do not have the \n\nchoice to purchase natural gas from competitive natural gas suppliers. The Utility Registrants remain the distribution service providers for all customers and are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective service territories while charging a regulated rate for distribution service. In addition, the Utility Registrants also retain significant default service obligations to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. PECO, BGE, and DPL also retain significant default service obligations to provide natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive natural gas supplier. \n\nFor customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from competitive suppliers, the Utility Registrants act as the billing agent and therefore do not record Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from a Utility Registrant, the Utility Registrants are permitted to recover the electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers without mark-up or with a slight mark-up and therefore record the amounts in Operating revenues and Purchased power and fuel expense. As a result, fluctuations in electricity or natural gas sales and procurement costs have no significant impact on the Utility Registrants&#8217; Net income. \n\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Results of Operations and Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding electric and natural gas distribution services. \n\nProcurement of Electricity and Natural Gas \n\nExelon does not generate the electricity it delivers. The Utility Registrants' electric supply for its customers is primarily procured through contracts as directed by their respective state laws and regulatory commission actions. The Utility Registrants procure electricity supply from various approved bidders or from purchases on the PJM operated markets. \n\nPECO's, BGE&#8217;s, and DPL's natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for terms that currently do not exceed three years. PECO, BGE, and DPL each have annual firm transportation contracts of 443,000 mmcf, 268,000 mmcf, and 44,000 mmcf, respectively, for delivery of gas. To supplement gas transportation and supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event of temporary emergencies, PECO, BGE, and DPL have available storage capacity from the following sources: \n\n##TABLE_START Peak Natural Gas Sources (in mmcf) LNG Facility Propane-Air Plant Underground Storage Service Agreements (a) \n\nPECO 1,200 150 19,400 BGE 1,056 550 22,000 DPL 250 N/A 3,900 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________ \n\n(a) Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 27%, 42%, and 33% of PECO's, BGE&#8217;s, and DPL's 2022-2023 heating season planned supplies, respectively. \n\nPECO, BGE, and DPL have long-term interstate pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO, BGE, and DPL make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas. The off-system gas sales are not material to PECO, BGE, and DPL. \n\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants), for additional information regarding Utility Registrants' contracts to procure electric supply and natural gas. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Programs \n\nThe Utility Registrants are generally allowed to recover costs associated with the energy efficiency and demand response programs they offer. Each commission approved program seeks to meet mandated electric consumption reduction targets and implement demand response measures to reduce peak demand. The programs are designed to meet standards required by each respective regulatory agency. \n\nComEd, with limited exceptions, earns a return on its energy efficiency costs through a regulatory asset. BGE, Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, and ACE earn a return on most of their energy efficiency and demand response program costs through a regulatory asset. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nCapital Investment \n\nThe Utility Registrants' businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments, primarily in electric transmission and distribution and natural gas transportation and distribution facilities, to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability, and efficiency of their systems. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Liquidity and Capital Resources, for additional information regarding projected 2023 capital expenditures. \n\nTransmission Services \n\nUnder FERC&#8217;s open access transmission policy, the Utility Registrants, as owners of transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates approved by FERC. The Utility Registrants and their affiliates are required to comply with FERC&#8217;s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of non-public transmission information between the transmission owner&#8217;s employees and wholesale merchant employees. \n\nPJM is the regional grid operator and operates pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Tariff. PJM operates the PJM energy, capacity, and other markets, and, through central dispatch, controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the region. The Utility Registrants are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. The Utility Registrants and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of certain of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the PJM transmission owners. \n\nThe Utility Registrants' transmission rates are established based on a FERC approved formula as shown below: \n\n##TABLE_START Approval Date ComEd January 2008 PECO December 2019 BGE April 2006 Pepco April 2006 DPL April 2006 ACE April 2006 ##TABLE_END\n\nExelon&#8217;s Strategy and Outlook \n\nFollowing the separation on February 1, 2022, Exelon is now a Distribution and Transmission company, focused on delivering electricity and natural gas service to our customers and communities. Exelon's businesses remain focused on maintaining industry leading operational excellence, meeting or exceeding their financial commitments, ensuring timely recovery on investments to enable customer benefits, supporting clean energy policies including those that advance our jurisdictions' clean energy targets, and continued commitment to corporate responsibility. \n\nExelon&#8217;s strategy is to improve reliability and operations, enhance the customer experience, and advance clean and affordable energy choices, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. The jurisdictions in which Exelon has operations have set some of the nation's leading clean energy targets and our strategy is to enable that future for all our stakeholders. The Utility Registrants invest in rate base that supports service to our customers and the community, including investments that sustain and improve reliability and resiliency and that enhance the service experience of our customers. The Utility Registrants make these investments prudently at a reasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. \n\nManagement continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon&#8217;s businesses, assets, and markets, leveraging Exelon&#8217;s expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns. \n\nThe Utility Registrants anticipate investing approximately $31 billion over the next four years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart grid technology, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately $18 billion by the end of 2026. These investments provide greater reliability, improved service for our customers, increased capacity to accommodate new technologies and support a cleaner grid, and a stable return for the company. \n\nIn August 2021, Exelon announced a Path to Clean goal to collectively reduce its operations-driven GHG emissions 50% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and to reach net zero operations-driven GHG emissions by 2050, while supporting customers and communities in achieving their GHG reduction goals (Path to Clean). Exelon's quantitative goals include its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, with the exception of Scope 2 emissions associated with system losses of electric power delivered to customers (\"line losses\"), and build upon Exelon's long-standing commitment to reducing our GHG emissions. Exelon's Path to Clean efforts extend beyond these quantitative goals to include efforts such as customer energy efficiency programs, which support reductions in customers' direct emissions and have the potential to reduce Exelon's Scope 3 emissions and Scope 2 line losses as well. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#8212; Environmental Matters and Regulation &#8212; Climate Change for additional information. \n\nVarious market, financial, regulatory, legislative, and operational factors could affect Exelon's success in pursuing its strategies. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information. \n\nEmployees \n\nThe Registrants strive to create a workplace culture that promotes and embodies diversity, inclusion, innovation, and safety for their employees. In order to provide the services and products that their customers expect, the Registrants aspire to create teams that reflect the diversity of the communities that the Registrants serve. Therefore, the Registrants take steps to attract highly qualified and diverse talent and seek to create hiring and promotion practices that are equitable and neutralize any bias, including unconscious bias. The Registrants provide growth opportunities, competitive compensation and benefits, and a variety of training and development programs. The Registrants are committed to helping employees grow their skills and careers largely through numerous training opportunities; mentorship programs; continuous feedback and development discussions; and evaluations. Employees are encouraged to thrive outside the workplace as well. The Registrants provide a full suite of wellness benefits targeted at supporting work-life balance, physical, mental and financial health, and industry-leading paid leave policies. \n\nThe Registrants typically conduct an employee engagement survey every other year to help identify organizational strengths and areas of opportunity for growth. The survey results are reviewed with senior management and the Exelon Board of Directors. \n\nDiversity Metrics \n\nThe following tables show diversity metrics for all employees and management as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Employees Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE \n\nFemale (a)(b)(c) \n\n5,300 1,535 752 786 1,270 329 139 109 \n\nPeople of Color (b)(c) \n\n7,519 2,575 990 1,170 1,803 865 203 145 Aged &#60;30 2,026 721 361 286 424 169 85 61 Aged 30-50 10,548 3,728 1,455 1,819 2,271 739 465 357 Aged &#62;50 6,489 1,907 1,070 1,061 1,466 442 341 203 \n\nTotal Employees (d) \n\n19,063 6,356 2,886 3,166 4,161 1,350 891 621 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START \n\nManagement (e) \n\nExelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE \n\nFemale (a)(b)(c) \n\n961 235 139 122 206 51 13 21 \n\nPeople of Color (b)(c) \n\n1,086 331 134 166 276 116 32 22 Aged &#60;30 29 7 9 4 6 &#8212; 2 2 Aged 30-50 1,715 510 182 265 395 120 58 40 Aged &#62;50 1,286 363 190 163 276 61 57 40 Within 10 years of retirement eligibility 1,787 520 238 226 379 91 68 55 \n\nTotal Employees in Management (d) \n\n3,030 880 381 432 677 181 117 82 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;__________ \n\n(a) The Registrants have a particular focus on creating an environment that attracts and retains women by enabling them to stay in the workforce, grow with the company, and move up the ranks. \n\n(b) To effectuate Exelon's pay equity goals, Exelon conducts analysis on gender and racial pay equity. \n\n(c) Information concerning women and people of color is based on self-disclosed information. \n\n(d) Total employees represents the sum of the aged categories. \n\n(e) Management is defined as executive/senior level officials and managers as well as all employees who have direct reports and/or supervisory responsibilities. \n\nTurnover Rates \n\nAs turnover is inherent, management succession planning is performed and tracked for all executives and critical key manager positions. Management frequently reviews succession planning to ensure the Registrants are prepared when positions become available. \n\nThe table below shows the average turnover rate for all employees for the last three years of 2020 to 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Retirement Age 3.71 % 4.09 % 4.10 % 3.48 % 3.79 % 3.74 % 4.42 % 3.88 % Voluntary 2.79 % 2.22 % 2.71 % 1.76 % 2.52 % 2.81 % 1.46 % 1.84 % Non-Voluntary 0.81 % 0.60 % 1.10 % 1.06 % 1.02 % 1.95 % 0.47 % 0.68 % ##TABLE_END\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreements \n\nApproximately 44% of Exelon&#8217;s employees participate in CBAs.

Exelon has a management team to address environmental compliance and strategy, including the CEO; the Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer; as well as senior management of the Utility Registrants. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The Audit and Risk Committee oversees compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including environmental risks related to Exelon's operations and facilities, as well as SEC disclosures related to environmental matters. Exelon's Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to oversee Exelon&#8217;s climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The respective Boards of the Utility Registrants oversee environmental issues related to these companies. The Exelon Board of Directors has general oversight responsibilities for ESG matters, including strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment. \n\nClimate Change \n\nAs detailed below, the Registrants face climate change mitigation and transition risks as well as adaptation risks. Mitigation and transition risks include changes to the energy systems as a result of new technologies, changing customer expectations and/or voluntary GHG goals, as well as local, state or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce GHG emissions. Adaptation risk refers to risks to the Registrants' facilities or operations that may result from changes to the physical climate and environment, such as changes to temperature, weather patterns and sea level. \n\nClimate Change Mitigation and Transition \n\nThe Registrants support comprehensive federal climate legislation that addresses the urgent need to substantially reduce national GHG emissions while providing appropriate protections for consumers, businesses, and the economy. In the absence of comprehensive federal climate legislation, Exelon supports the EPA moving forward with meaningful regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. \n\nThe Registrants currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, federal and/or state legislation and/or regulations addressing GHG emissions. GHG emission sources associated with the Registrants include sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage from electric transmission and distribution operations, refrigerant leakage from chilling and cooling equipment, and fossil fuel combustion in motor vehicles. In addition, PECO, BGE, and DPL, as distributors of natural gas are regulated with respect to reporting of natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems and consumer use of such natural gas. \n\nSince its inception, Exelon has positioned itself as a leader in climate change mitigation. Exelon uses definitions and protocols provided by the World Resources Institute for its GHG inventory. In 2021, Exelon's Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, as revised following its separation from Constellation, were just over 5.7 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent using the World Resources Institute Corporate Standard Market-based accounting. Of these emissions, 0.5 million metric tons are considered to be operations-driven and in more direct control of our employees and processes. The majority of these operations-driven emissions are fugitive emissions from the gas delivery systems of Registrants PECO, BGE, and DPL. The remaining 5.2 million metric tons, approximately 91%, are the indirect emissions associated with the operation and use of the electric distribution and transmission system and primarily consists of losses resulting from the Utility Registrant's delivery of electricity to their customers (line losses). These emissions are driven primarily by customer demand for electricity and the mix of generation assets supplying energy to the electric grid. The Registrants do not own generation and must comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements governing procurement of electricity for delivery to retail customers and use of the system to support other transmission transactions. However, the Registrants do engage in efforts that help to reduce these emissions, including customer programs to drive customer energy efficiency, help to manage peak demands, and enable distributed solar generation. \n\nIn August 2021, Exelon announced a Path to Clean goal to collectively reduce their operations-driven GHG emissions 50% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline, and to reach net zero operations-driven GHG emissions by 2050, while also supporting customers and communities to achieve their clean energy and emissions goals. Exelon&#8217;s quantitative goals include its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, with the exception of Scope 2 line losses, and builds upon Exelon's long-standing commitment to reducing our GHG emissions. Exelon's activities in support of the Path to Clean goal will include efficiency and clean electricity for operations, vehicle fleet electrification, equipment and processes to reduce sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage, investments in natural gas infrastructure to minimize methane leaks and increase safety and reliability, and investment and collaboration to develop new technologies. Beyond 2030, Exelon recognizes that technology advancement and continued policy support will be needed to ensure achievement of Net-Zero by 2050. Exelon is laying the groundwork by partnering with national labs, universities and research consortia to research, develop, and pilot clean technologies that will be needed, as well as working with our states, jurisdictions and policy makers to understand the scope and scale of energy transformation, and needed policies and incentives, that will be needed to reach local ambitions for GHG emissions reductions. The Utility Registrants are also supporting customers and communities to achieve their clean energy and emissions goals through significant energy efficiency programs. During 2023 - 2026, estimated customer program energy efficiency investments across the Utility Registrants total $3.5 billion. These programs enable customer savings through home energy audits, lighting discounts, appliance recycling, home improvement rebates, equipment upgrade incentives and innovative programs like smart thermostats and combined heat and power programs. \n\nAs an energy delivery company, Exelon can play a key role in lowering GHG emissions across much of the economy in its service territories. In connecting end users of energy to electric and gas supply, Exelon can leverage its assets and customer interface to encourage efficient use of lower emitting resources as they become available. Electrification, where feasible for transportation, buildings, and industry coupled with simultaneous decarbonization of electric generation, can be a key lever for emissions reductions. To support this transition, Exelon is advocating for public policy supportive of vehicle electrification, investing in enabling infrastructure and technology, and supporting customer education and adoption. In addition, the Utility Registrants have a goal to electrify 30% of their own vehicle fleet by 2025, increasing to 50% by 2030. Clean fuels and other emerging technologies can also support the transition, lessen the strain on electric system expansion, and support energy system resiliency. Exelon, and its registrants PECO, BGE, and DPL that own gas distribution assets, are also continuing to explore these other decarbonization opportunities, supporting pilots of emerging energy technologies and clean fuels to support both operational and customer-driven emissions reductions. The energy transition may present challenges for the Utility Registrants and their service territories. Exelon believes its market and business model could be significantly affected by the transition of the energy system, such as through an increased electric load and decreased demand for natural gas, potentially accompanied by changes in technology, customer expectations, and/or regulatory structures. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry. \n\nClimate Change Adaptation \n\nThe Registrants' facilities and operations are subject to the impacts of global climate change. Long-term shifts in climactic patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures and sea level rise, may present challenges for the Registrants and their service territories. Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the physical risks of climate change. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information related to the Registrants' risks associated with climate change. \n\nThe Registrants' assets undergo seasonal readiness efforts to ensure they are ready for the weather projections of the summer and winter months. The Registrants consider and review national climate assessments to inform their planning. Each of the Utility Registrants also has well established system recovery plans and is investing in its systems to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to anticipated storm damage. \n\nInternational Climate Change Agreements. At the international level, the United States is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12, 2015. Under the Agreement, which became effective on November 4, 2016, the parties committed to try to limit the global average temperature increase and to develop national GHG reduction commitments. On November 4, 2020, the United States formally withdrew from the Paris Agreement, but on January 20, 2021, President Biden \n\naccepted the Agreement, which resulted in the United States&#8217; formal re-entry on February 19, 2021. The United States has set an economy-wide target of reducing its net GHG emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. On November 11, 2022 at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 27), President Biden recommitted the U.S. to these goals and detailed the significant domestic climate actions the U.S. had taken to spur a new era of clean American manufacturing, enhance energy security, and drive down the costs of clean energy for consumers in the U.S. and around the world. \n\nFederal Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which aims to reduce U.S. carbon emissions and promote economic development through investments in clean and renewable energy projects. The consumer-facing clean energy tax credits created or expanded by the IRA are intended to drive rapid adoption of energy efficiency, electric transportation, and solar energy which would require Exelon's utilities to expand and modernize infrastructure, systems and services to integrate and optimize these resources. \n\nRegulation of GHGs from Power Plants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA&#8217;s 2015 Clean Power Plan (CPP) established regulations addressing carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fired power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d). The CPP&#8217;s carbon pollution limits could be met through changes to the electric generation system, including shifting generation from higher-emitting units to lower- or zero-emitting units, as well as the development of new or expanded zero-emissions generation. In July 2019, the EPA published its final Affordable Clean Energy rule, which repealed the CPP and replaced it with less stringent emissions guidelines for existing fossil-fired power plants based on heat rate improvement measures that could be achieved within the fence line of individual plants. Exelon, together with a coalition of other electric utilities, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the rescission of the Clean Power Plan and enactment of the Affordable Clean Energy rule as unlawful. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit held the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (including its rescission of the Clean Power Plan) to be unlawful, vacated the rule, and remanded it to the EPA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to examine the extent of the EPA's authority to regulate GHGs from power plants and, on June 30, 2022, reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA's use of generation shifting for development of standards in the Clean Power Plan went beyond Congress' intended authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has indicated that it will promulgate new GHG limits for existing power plants. Increased regulation of GHG emissions from power plants could increase the cost of electricity delivered or sold by the Registrants. As of February 1, 2022, following its separation from Constellation, Exelon no longer owns electric generation plants. \n\nState Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. A number of states in which the Registrants operate have state and regional programs to reduce GHG emissions and renewable and other portfolio standards, which impact the power sector. See discussion below for additional information on renewable and other portfolio standards. \n\nCertain northeast and mid-Atlantic states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia) currently participate in the RGGI. The program requires most fossil fuel-fired power plant owners and operators in the region to hold allowances, purchased at auction, for each ton of CO2 emissions. Non-emitting resources do not have to purchase or hold these allowances. Pennsylvania joined RGGI in April 2022. \n\nBroader state programs impact other sectors as well, such as the District of Columbia's Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act and cross-sector GHG reduction plans, which resulted in recent requirements for Pepco to develop 5-year and 30-year decarbonization programs and strategies. Maryland expects to meet and exceed the mandate set in the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act to reduce statewide GHG emissions 40% (from 2006 levels) by 2030, and the state&#8217;s Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 further updates requirements with a proposal to reduce emissions 60% (from 2006 levels) by 2031. New Jersey accelerated its goals through Executive Order 274, which establishes an interim goal of 50% reductions below 2006 levels by 2030 and affirms its goal of achieving 80% reductions by 2050 and includes programs to drive greater amounts of electrified transportation. Illinois&#8217; climate bill, CEJA, establishes decarbonization requirements for the state to transition to 100% clean energy by 2050 and supports programs to improve energy efficiency, manage energy demand, attract clean energy investment and accelerate job creation. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on CEJA. \n\nThe Registrants cannot predict the nature of future regulations or how such regulations might impact future financial statements. \n\nRenewable and Clean Energy Standards. Each of the states where Exelon operates have adopted some form of renewable or clean energy procurement requirement. These standards impose varying levels of mandates for procurement of renewable or clean electricity (the definition of which varies by state) and/or energy efficiency. These are generally expressed as a percentage of annual electric load, often increasing by year. The Utility Registrants comply with these various requirements through acquiring sufficient bundled or unbundled credits such as RECs, CMCs, or ZECs, or paying an alternative compliance payment, and/or a combination of these compliance alternatives. The Utility Registrants are permitted to recover from retail customers the costs of complying with their state RPS requirements, including the procurement of RECs or other alternative energy resources. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nOther Environmental Regulation \n\nWater Quality \n\nUnder the federal Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated, and permits must be renewed periodically. Certain of Exelon's facilities discharge water into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits. \n\nUnder Clean Water Act Section 404 and state laws and regulations, the Registrants may be required to obtain permits for projects involving dredge or fill activities in waters of the United States. \n\nWhere Registrants&#8217; facilities are required to secure a federal license or permit for activities that may result in a discharge to covered waters, they may be required to obtain a state water quality certification under Clean Water Act section 401. \n\nSolid and Hazardous Waste and Environmental Remediation \n\nCERCLA provides for response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances and authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of hazardous waste at sites, many of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight. Most states have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. Such statutes apply in many states where the Registrants currently own or operate, or previously owned or operated, facilities, including Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted. \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures in order to comply with these Federal and state environmental laws. Under these laws, the Registrants may be liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. The Registrants and their subsidiaries are, or could become in the future, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies, and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA or similar state laws with respect to a number of sites or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party. \n\nComEd&#8217;s and PECO&#8217;s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites, which were operated by ComEd's and PECO's predecessor companies. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover certain environmental remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE do not have material contingent liabilities relating to MGP sites. The amount to be \n\nexpended in 2023 for compliance with environmental remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is estimated to be approxim ately $52 million which consists primarily of $44 million at ComEd. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Registrants have established appropriate contingent liabilities for environmental remediation requirements. In addition, the Registrants may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs. \n\nSee Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants&#8217; environmental matters, remediation efforts, and related impacts to the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nInformation about our Executive Officers as of February 14, 2023 \n\nExelon \n\n##TABLE_START Name Age Position Period Butler, Calvin G.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nEach of the Registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant&#8217;s direct control. Such risks, which could negatively affect one or more of the Registrants&#8217; consolidated financial statements, fall primarily under the categories below: \n\nRisks related to market and financial factors primarily include: \n\n&#8226; the demand for electricity, reliability of service, and affordability in the markets where the Utility Registrants conduct their business, \n\n&#8226; the ability of the Utility Registrants to operate their respective transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and the impacts on their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity/cash flows due to public health crises, epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and \n\n&#8226; emerging technologies and business models, including those related to climate change mitigation and transition to a low carbon economy. \n\nRisks related to legislative, regulatory, and legal factors primarily include changes to, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that govern: \n\n&#8226; utility regulatory business models, \n\n&#8226; environmental and climate policy, and \n\n&#8226; tax policy. \n\nRisks related to operational factors primarily include: \n\n&#8226; changes in the global climate could produce extreme weather events, which could put the Registrant&#8217;s facilities at risk, and such changes could also affect the levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, \n\n&#8226; the ability of the Utility Registrants to maintain the reliability, resiliency, and safety of their energy delivery systems, which could affect their ability to deliver energy to their customers and affect their operating costs, and \n\n&#8226; physical and cyber security risks for the Utility Registrants as the owner-operators of transmission and distribution facilities. \n\nRisks related to the separation primarily include: \n\n&#8226; challenges to achieving the benefits of separation and \n\n&#8226; performance by Exelon and Constellation under the transaction agreements, including indemnification responsibilities. \n\nThere may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that could negatively affect the Registrants' consolidated financial statements in the future. \n\nRisks Related to Market and Financial Factors \n\nThe Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry (All Registrants). \n\nAdvancements in power generation technology, including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations, are improving the cost-effectiveness of customer self-supply of electricity. Improvements in energy storage technology, including batteries and fuel cells, could also better position customers to meet their around-the-clock electricity requirements. Improvements in energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, equipment and building materials will also affect energy consumption by customers. Changes in power generation, storage, and use technologies could have significant effects on customer behaviors and their energy consumption. \n\nThese developments could affect levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations, and current business models and make portions of the Utility Registrants' transmission and/or distribution facilities uneconomic prior to the end of their useful lives. Increasing pressure from both the private and public sectors to take actions to mitigate climate change could also push the speed and nature of this transition. These factors could affect the Registrants&#8217; consolidated financial statements through, among other things, increased operating and maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation over shortened remaining asset useful lives. \n\nMarket performance and other factors could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (All Registrants). \n\nDisruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Exelon&#8217;s employee benefit plan trusts. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below Exelon's projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. See Note 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could negatively affect the Registrants&#8217; ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets because of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, or require a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants&#8217; ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 23%, 10%, and 16% of the Registrants&#8217; available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively. Additionally, higher interest rates may put pressure on the Registrants&#8217; overall liquidity profile, financial health and impact financial results. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities. \n\nIf any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties or regulatory financial requirements, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral that could affect its liquidity and could experience higher borrowing costs (All Registrants). \n\nThe Utility Registrants' operating agreements with PJM and PECO's, BGE's, and DPL's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. PJM collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE, and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. If the Utility Registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the Utility Registrants. \n\nThe Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as &#8220;ring-fencing&#8221;) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant. \n\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Credit Matters and Cash Requirements &#8212; Security Ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants&#8217; cash flows. \n\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (All Registrants). \n\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns on the Utility Registrants' customers and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations for the Utility Registrants, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances and related expense. Further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the Utility Registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms. \n\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information on the Registrants&#8217; credit risk. \n\nPublic health crises, epidemics, or pandemics, such as COVID-19 could negatively impact the Registrants' results (All Registrants). \n\nCOVID-19 disrupted economic activity in the Registrants&#8217; respective markets and negatively affected the Registrants&#8217; results of operations in 2020. However, the financial impacts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, other than the 2022 impairment disclosure within Note 11 &#8212; Asset Impairments. The Registrants cannot predict the full extent of the impacts of COVID-19, which will depend on, among other things, the rate, and public perceptions of the effectiveness, of vaccinations and rate of resumption of business activity. In addition, any future widespread pandemic or other local or global health issue could adversely affect our vendors, competitors or customers and customer demand as well as the Registrants&#8217; ability to operate their transmission and distribution assets. See Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Executive Overview for additional information. \n\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (All Registrants). \n\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting operating revenues at PECO and DPL Delaware. Due to revenue decoupling, operating revenues from electric distribution at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE are not affected by abnormal weather. \n\nExtreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the Utility Registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant. \n\nClimate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends, as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the long-term in the areas where the Utility Registrants have transmission and distribution assets. The frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to weather-related impacts discussed above. \n\nLong-lived assets, goodwill, and other assets could become impaired (All Registrants). \n\nLong-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants&#8217; statements of financial position. In addition, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI have material goodwill balances. \n\nThe Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered. \n\nComEd and PHI perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the \n\nreporting units below their carrying amount. Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd&#8217;s, Pepco&#8217;s, DPL&#8217;s, and ACE&#8217;s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon&#8217;s, ComEd's, and PHI&#8217;s goodwill. \n\nAn impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 7 &#8212; Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 11 &#8212; Asset Impairments, and Note 12 &#8212; Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long-lived asset impairments and goodwill impairments. \n\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the Registrants have guaranteed their performance (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. Each of the Utility Registrants has transferred its former generation business to a third party and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable Utility Registrant for such obligations. In connection with the restructurings under which ComEd, PECO, and BGE transferred their generating assets to Constellation, Constellation assumed certain of ComEd&#8217;s, PECO&#8217;s, and BGE's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd, PECO, and BGE have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd, PECO, or BGE for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Constellation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party, Constellation, or the transferee of Pepco's, DPL's, or ACE&#8217;s generation facilities experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable Utility Registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. In addition, the Utility Registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation facilities. \n\nThe Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets, including several of the Utility Registrants in connection with Constellation's absorption of their former generating assets. The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these indemnities. \n\nThe Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrants to perform if the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. \n\nRisks Related to Legislative, Regulatory, and Legal Factors \n\nThe Registrants' businesses are highly regulated and electric and gas revenue and earnings could be negatively affected by legislative and/or regulatory actions (All Registrants). \n\nSubstantial aspects of the Registrants' businesses are subject to comprehensive Federal or state legislation and/or regulation. \n\nThe Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase, transmission, and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers. \n\nFundamental changes in regulations or adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants&#8217; businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether legislative or regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect would be on the Registrants. \n\nChanges in the Utility Registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, along with adoption of new rate structures and constructs, or establishment of new rate cases, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result, and which could introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (All Registrants). \n\nThe Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services, adoption of new rate structures and constructs or establishment of new rate cases. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, credit losses, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives, or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of PJM&#8217;s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements (All Registrants). \n\nThe Utility Registrants as users, owners, and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the Utility Registrants were found in non-compliance with the Federal and state mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties. \n\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state, and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the way the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions, hazardous and solid waste, and activities affecting surface waters, groundwater, and aquatic and other species. Violations of these requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages, or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generated or released. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in several proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#8212; Environmental Matters and Regulation for additional information. \n\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers (All Registrants). \n\nChanges to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of clean, renewable, and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed. \n\nFederal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility Registrants consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. These energy conservation programs, regulated energy consumption reduction targets, and new energy consumption technologies could cause declines in customer energy consumption and lead to a decline in the Registrants' earnings, if timely recovery is not allowed. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#8212; Environmental Matters and Regulation &#8212; Renewable and Clean Energy Standards and \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information. \n\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants are required to make judgments to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities, which includes general tax positions taken and associated reserves established. Tax obligations include, but are not limited to: income, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. All tax estimates could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. Additionally, earnings may be impacted due to changes in federal or local/state tax laws, and the inherent difficulty of estimating potential tax effects of ongoing business decisions. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13 &#8212; Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nLegal proceedings could result in a negative outcome, which the Registrants cannot predict (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of their business operations. The material ones are summarized in Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue, or restrict, or disrupt business activities. \n\nThe Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants could be the subject of public criticism. Adverse publicity of this nature could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies in a favorable light, and could cause those companies, including the Registrants, to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements. \n\nExelon and ComEd have received requests for information related to an SEC investigation into their lobbying activities. The outcome of the investigations could have a material adverse effect on their reputation and consolidated financial statements (Exelon and ComEd). \n\nOn October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had opened an investigation into their lobbying activities in the state of Illinois. Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully, including by providing all information requested by the SEC, and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the SEC. The outcome of the SEC&#8217;s investigation cannot be predicted and could subject Exelon and ComEd to civil penalties, sanctions, or other remedial measures. Any of the foregoing, as well as the appearance of non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, could have an adverse impact on Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s reputations or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers, and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial \n\nstatements. See Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIf ComEd violates its Deferred Prosecution Agreement announced on July 17, 2020, it could have an adverse effect on the reputation and consolidated financial statements of Exelon and ComEd (Exelon and ComEd). \n\nOn July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) to resolve the USAO&#8217;s investigation into Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA and the investigation by the USAO into Exelon&#8217;s activities ended with no charges being brought against Exelon. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker&#8217;s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker&#8217;s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd&#8217;s interests. The DPA provides that the USAO will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) payment to the U.S. Treasury of $200 million; (ii) continued full cooperation with the government&#8217;s investigation; and (iii) ComEd&#8217;s adoption and maintenance of remedial measures involving compliance and reporting undertakings as specified in the DPA. If ComEd is found to have breached the terms of the DPA, the USAO may elect to prosecute, or bring a civil action against, ComEd for conduct alleged in the DPA or known to the government, which could result in fines or penalties and could have an adverse impact on Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s reputation or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nRisks Related to Operational Factors \n\nThe Registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants periodically perform analyses to better understand long-term projections of climate change and how those changes in the physical environments where they operate could affect their facilities and operations. The Registrants primarily operate in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic of the United States, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, and as such the Registrants have well-developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. However, the Registrants&#8217; physical facilities could be at greater risk of damage as changes in the global climate affect temperature and weather patterns, or be placed at greater risk of damage should climate changes result in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, elevated levels of precipitation, sea level rise, increased surface water temperatures, and/or other effects. Over time, the Registrants are making additional investments to protect their facilities from physical climate-related risks. \n\nIn addition, changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect Registrants&#8217; operations. Over time, the Registrants are making additional investments to adapt to changes in operational requirements to manage demand changes and customer expectations caused by climate change. \n\nClimate Change risks include changes to the energy systems due to new technologies, changing customer expectations and/or voluntary GHG goals, as well as local, state, or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce GHG emissions. The Registrants also periodically perform analyses of potential energy system transition pathways to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. To the extent additional GHG reduction legislation and/or regulation becomes effective at the Federal and/or state levels, the Registrants could incur costs to further limit the GHG emissions from their operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#8212; Environmental Matters and Regulation &#8212; Climate Change and ITEM 1.A. \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information. \n\nThe Utility Registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (All Registrants). \n\nFailures of the equipment or facilities used in the Utility Registrants' delivery systems could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to several factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of AMI, smart grid, or other technologies in the Utility Registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. \n\nRegulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material. \n\nThe Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (All Registrants). \n\nThe Registrants face physical security and cybersecurity risks. Threat sources, including sophisticated nation-state actors, continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry, grid infrastructure, and other energy infrastructures, and these attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks. Additionally, the U.S. government has warned that the Ukraine conflict may increase the risks of attacks targeting critical infrastructure in the United States. \n\nA security breach of the Registrants' physical assets or information systems or those of the Registrants competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could materially impact Registrants by, among other things, impairing the availability of electricity and gas distributed by Registrants and/or the reliability of transmission and distribution systems, impairing the availability of vendor services and materials that the Registrants rely on to maintain their operations, or by leading to the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor, or employee data, or other confidential data. The risk of these events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while the Registrants have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date none have directly experienced a material breach or material disruption to its network or information systems or our operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the Registrants may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future. \n\nIf a significant security breach were to occur, the Registrants' reputation could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry could be diminished, or the Registrants could be subject to legal claims, loss of revenues, increased costs, or operations shutdown. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result. \n\nThe Utility Registrants' deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties. \n\nIn addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; employees, contractors, customers, and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry (All Registrants). \n\nEmployees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the Registrants&#8217; operations. As a result, employees, \n\ncontractors, customers, and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. These risks include gas explosions, pole strikes, and electric contact cases. \n\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic, and other significant events could negatively impact the Registrants' results of operations, ability to raise capital and future growth (All Registrants). \n\nThe Utility Registrants' distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters and extreme weather events, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Utility Registrants&#8217; service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. \n\nThe impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and the Registrants is uncertain. The Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of the Registrants' facilities, which could adversely affect the Registrants' ability to manage their businesses effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession, or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs. \n\nThe Registrants could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate Exelon's transmission and distribution assets could be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty, and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses. \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure or be impacted by lack of availability of critical parts, which could result in potential liability (All Registrants). \n\nThe Utility Registrants&#8217; businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Utility Registrants&#8217; control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. Additionally, if critical parts are not available, it may impact the timing of execution of capital projects. The Registrants' consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital, or if they are deemed liable for operational failure. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Registrants&#8217; potential future capital expenditures. \n\nThe Utility Registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs, and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (All Registrants). \n\nDemand for electricity within the Utility Registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the Utility Registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures. \n\nPJM&#8217;s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants&#8217; service areas. \n\nThe Registrants' performance could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (All Registrants). \n\nCertain events, such as the separation transaction, an employee strike, loss of employees, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, could arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their transmission and distribution operations as well as areas where new technologies are pertinent. \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; performance could be negatively affected by poor performance of third-party contractors that perform periodic or ongoing work (All Registrants). \n\nAll Registrants rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance, and construction work. Performance standards typically are included in all contractual obligations, but poor performance may impact the capital execution plan or operations, or have adverse financial or reputational consequences. \n\nThe Registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (All Registrants). \n\nThe Utility Registrants face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated initiatives, such as smart grids and and broader beneficial electrification. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity, and obsolescence of technology. Such initiatives may not be successful. \n\nRisks Related to the Separation (Exelon) \n\nThe separation may not achieve some or all of the benefits anticipated by Exelon and, following the separation, Exelon's common stock price may underperform relative to Exelon's expectations. \n\nBy separating the Utility Registrants and Constellation, Exelon created two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separate companies are expected to create value by having the strategic flexibility to focus on their unique customer, market and community priorities. However, the separation may not provide such results on the scope or scale that Exelon anticipates, and Exelon may not realize the anticipated benefits of the separation. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on Exelon's financial statements and its common stock price. \n\nIn connection with the separation into two public companies, Exelon and Constellation will indemnify each other for certain liabilities. If Exelon is required to pay under these indemnities to Constellation, Exelon's financial results could be negatively impacted. The Constellation indemnities may not be sufficient to hold Exelon harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which Constellation will be allocated responsibility, and Constellation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future. \n\nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements between Exelon and Constellation, each party will agree to indemnify the other for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnities that Exelon may be required to provide Constellation are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact its business. Third parties could also seek to hold Exelon responsible for any of the liabilities that Constellation has agreed to retain. Any amounts Exelon is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require Exelon to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of its operating business. Further, the indemnities from Constellation for Exelon's benefit may not be \n\nsufficient to protect Exelon against the full amount of such liabilities, and Constellation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. \n\nMoreover, even if Exelon ultimately succeeds in recovering from Constellation any amounts for which Exelon is held liable, Exelon may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect Exelon's business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n##TABLE_START "

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\n(Dollars in millions except per share data, unless otherwise noted) \n\nExelon \n\nExecutive Overview \n\nExelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. \n\nExelon has six reportable segments consisting of ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 &#8212; Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon's principal subsidiaries and reportable segments. \n\nExelon&#8217;s consolidated financial information includes the results of its seven separate operating subsidiary registrants, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, which, along with Exelon, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. The following combined Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is separately filed by Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. However, none of the Registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to any of the other Registrants. For discussion of the Utility Registrants' year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS in the 2021 Recast Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on June 30, 2022. \n\nCOVID-19. The Registrants have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak (pandemic) of COVID-19. The Registrants provide a critical service to our customers which means that it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our businesses safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus by taking extra precautions for employees who work in the field and in our facilities. The Registrants have implemented work from home policies where appropriate, and imposed travel limitations on employees. \n\nThe Registrants continue to implement strong physical and cyber-security measures to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and keep them running to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers. \n\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting as a result of COVID-19 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the Registrants&#8217; internal control over financial reporting. See ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES for additional information. \n\nThere were no material impacts to Exelon from unfavorable economic conditions due to COVID-19 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other than the 2022 impairment discussed below. \n\nThe Registrants assessed long-lived assets, goodwill, and investments for recoverability. Exelon and BGE recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 48 million in 2022 as a result of COVID-19 impacts on office use. See Note 12 &#8212; Asset Impairments for additional information related to this impairment assessment. None of the other Registrants recorded material impairment charges in 2022 as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, there were no material impairment charges recorded in 2021 as a result of COVID-19. \n\nThe Registrants will continue to monitor developments affecting their workforce, customers, and suppliers and will take additional precautions that they determine to be necessary in order to mitigate the impacts. The Registrants cannot predict the full extent of the impacts of COVID-19, which will depend on, among other things, the rate, and public perceptions of the effectiveness, of vaccinations and rate of resumption of business activity. \n\nFinancial Results of Operations \n\nGAAP Results of Operations. The following table sets forth Exelon's GAAP consolidated Net income attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations and the Utility Registrants' Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. For additional information regarding the financial results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 see the discussions of Results of Operations by Registrant. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Favorable (Unfavorable) Variance Exelon 2,054 1,616 $ 438 ComEd 917 742 175 PECO 576 504 72 BGE 380 408 (28) PHI 608 561 47 Pepco 305 296 9 DPL 169 128 41 ACE 148 146 2 \n\nOther (a) \n\n(427) (599) 172 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon&#8217;s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investing activities. \n\nThe separation of Constellation Energy Corporation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, Generation's results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from Exelon's continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations for additional information. \n\nAccounting rules require that certain BSC costs previously allocated to Generation be presented as part of Exelon&#8217;s continuing operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations. Such costs are included in Other in the table above and were $28 million and $429 million on a pre-tax basis, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021. Net income attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations increased by $438 million and diluted earnings per average common share from continuing operations increased to $2.08 in 2022 from $1.65 in 2021 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; Higher electric distribution earnings and energy efficiency earnings from higher rate base and higher allowed ROE due to an increase in treasury rates at ComEd; \n\n&#8226; The favorable impacts of rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI; \n\n&#8226; Favorable impacts of decreased storm costs at PECO and BGE; and \n\n&#8226; Lower BSC costs presented in Exelon&#8217;s continuing operations, which were previously allocated to Generation but do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operation per the accounting rules. \n\nThe increases were partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; An income tax expense recorded in connection with the separation primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change, the recognition of valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets positions for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, and nondeductible transaction costs partially offset by a one-time impact associated with a state tax benefit; \n\n&#8226; An adjustment at PECO to exclude one-time non-cash impacts associated with the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate; \n\n&#8226; Higher depreciation expense at PECO, BGE, and PHI; \n\n&#8226; Higher credit loss expense at PECO, BGE, and PHI; \n\n&#8226; Higher storm costs at PHI; and \n\n&#8226; Higher interest expense at PECO, BGE, PHI, and Exelon Corporate. \n\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. In addition to Net income, Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor&#8217;s overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of Exelon&#8217;s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies&#8217; presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between Net income attributable to common shareholders from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (In millions, except per share data) Earnings per Diluted Share Earnings per Diluted Share Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders from Continuing Operations $ 2,054 &#160; $ 2.08 &#160; $ 1,616 &#160; $ 1.65 &#160; Mark-to-Market Impact of Economic Hedging Activities (net of taxes of $1 and $3, respectively) 4 &#8212; 4 &#8212; \n\nAsset Impairments (net of taxes of $10) (a) \n\n38 0.04 &#8212; &#8212; \n\nCost Management Program (net of taxes of $1) (b) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; 6 0.01 Asset Retirement Obligation (net of taxes of $2 and $1, respectively) (4) &#8212; 2 &#8212; \n\nCOVID-19 Direct Costs (net of taxes of $6) (c) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; 14 0.01 \n\nAcquisition Related Costs (net of taxes of $5) (d) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; 15 0.02 \n\nERP System Implementation Costs (net of taxes of $0 and $4, respectively) (e) \n\n1 &#8212; 13 0.01 \n\nSeparation Costs (net of taxes of $10 and $21, respectively) (f) \n\n24 0.02 58 0.06 \n\nIncome Tax-Related Adjustments (entire amount represents tax expense) (g) \n\n122 0.12 62 0.06 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings $ 2,239 &#160; $ 2.27 &#160; $ 1,791 &#160; $ 1.83 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\nNote: \n\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding. \n\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. The marginal statutory income tax rates for 2022 and 2021 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%. \n\n(a) Reflects costs related to the impairment of an office building at BGE, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. \n\n(b) Primarily represents reorganization costs related to cost management programs. \n\n(c) Represents direct costs related to COVID-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of employees, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. \n\n(d) Reflects certain BSC costs related to the acquisition of EDF's interest in CENG, which was completed in the third quarter of 2021, that were historically allocated to Generation but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon's results as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules. \n\n(e) Reflects costs related to a multi-year ERP system implementation, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. \n\n(f) Represents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. \n\n(g) In 2021, for PHI, primarily reflects the recognition of a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset associated with Delaware net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in Delaware tax law. In 2021, for Corporate, reflects the adjustment to deferred income taxes due to changes in forecasted apportionment. In 2022, for PECO, primarily reflects an adjustment to exclude one-time non-cash impacts associated with the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate. In 2022, for Corporate, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax expense primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change, the recognition of valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets positions for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, and nondeductible transaction costs partially offset by a one-time impact associated with a state tax benefit. \n\nSignificant 2022 Transactions and Developments \n\nSeparation \n\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies (&#8220;the separation&#8221;). Exelon completed the separation on February 1, 2022. Constellation was newly formed and incorporated in Pennsylvania on June 15, 2021 for the purpose of separation and holds Generation. The separation represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on Exelon&#8217;s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the separation meets the criteria for discontinued operations. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the separation and discontinued operations. \n\nIn connection with the separation, Exelon incurred separation costs impacting continuing operations of $34 million and $79 million on a pre-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense. These costs are excluded from Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. The separation costs are primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs. \n\nEquity Securities Offering \n\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon entered into an agreement with certain underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering of 12.995 million shares of its common stock, no par value. The net proceeds were $563 million before expenses paid by Exelon. See Note 19 &#8212; Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nUtility Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings \n\nThe Utility Registrants file base rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants&#8217; current and future financial statements. \n\nThe following tables show the Utility Registrants&#8217; completed and pending distribution base rate case proceedings in 2022. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these and other regulatory proceedings. \n\nCompleted Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant/Jurisdiction Filing Date Service Requested Revenue Requirement Increase Approved Revenue Requirement Increase Approved ROE Approval Date Rate Effective Date ComEd - Illinois April 16, 2021 Electric $ 51 $ 46 7.36 % December 1, 2021 January 1, 2022 April 15, 2022 Electric 199 199 7.85 % November 17, 2022 January 1, 2023 PECO - Pennsylvania March 30, 2021 Electric 246 132 N/A November 18, 2021 January 1, 2022 March 31, 2022 Natural Gas 82 55 October 27, 2022 January 1, 2023 BGE - Maryland May 15, 2020 (amended September 11, 2020) Electric 203 140 9.50 % December 16, 2020 January 1, 2021 Natural Gas 108 74 9.65 % Pepco - District of Columbia May 30, 2019 (amended June 1, 2020) Electric 136 109 9.275 % June 8, 2021 July 1, 2021 Pepco - Maryland October 26, 2020 (amended March 31, 2021) Electric 104 52 9.55 % June 28, 2021 June 28, 2021 DPL - Maryland September 1, 2021 (amended December 23, 2021) Electric 27 13 9.60 % March 2, 2022 March 2, 2022 May 19, 2022 Electric 38 29 9.60 % December 14, 2022 January 1, 2023 DPL - Delaware January 14, 2022 (amended August 15, 2022) Natural Gas 13 8 9.60 % October 12, 2022 August 14, 2022 ACE - New Jersey December 9, 2020 (amended February 26, 2021) Electric 67 41 9.60 % July 14, 2021 January 1, 2022 ##TABLE_END\n\nPending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant/Jurisdiction Filing Date Service Requested Revenue Requirement Increase Requested ROE Expected Approval Timing ComEd - Illinois January 17, 2023 Electric $ 1,472 10.50% to 10.65% \n\nFourth quarter of 2023 DPL - Delaware December 15, 2022 Electric 60 10.50 % Second quarter of 2024 ##TABLE_END\n\nTransmission Formula Rates \n\nThe following total increases/(decreases) were included in the Utility Registrants' 2022 annual electric transmission formula rate updates.

The tax rate will be reduced to 8.99% for the 2023 tax year. Starting with the 2024 tax year, the rate is reduced by 0.50% annually until it reaches 4.99% in 2031. As a result of the rate change, in the third quarter of 2022, Exelon and PECO recorded a one-time decrease to deferred income taxes of $390 million with a corresponding decrease to the deferred income taxes regulatory asset of $428 million for the amounts that are expected to be settled through future customer rates and an increase to income tax expense of $38 million (net of federal taxes), which was excluded from Exelon's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. The tax rate decrease is not expected to have a material ongoing impact to Exelon&#8217;s and PECO&#8217;s financial statements. See Note 13 &#8212; Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nInflation Reduction Act \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The bill extends tax benefits for renewable technologies like solar and wind, and it creates new tax benefits for alternative clean energy sources like nuclear and hydrogen and it focuses on energy efficiency, electrification, and equity. However, the bill also implements a new 15.0% corporate minimum tax based on modified GAAP net income. Exelon estimates the IRA could result in an increase in cash taxes for Exelon of approximately $200 million per year starting in 2023. Exelon is continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on the financial statements and will update estimates based on guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury in the future. \n\nAsset Impairment \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, a review of the impacts of COVID-19 on office use resulted in plans to cease the renovation and dispose of an office building at BGE before the asset was placed into service. BGE determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and that its fair value was less than carrying value. As a result, Exelon and BGE recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $48 million in 2022, which was excluded from Exelon's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. See Note 11 &#8212; Asset Impairments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nComEd's FERC Audit \n\nThe Registrants are subject to periodic audits and investigations by FERC. FERC&#8217;s Division of Audits and Accounting initiated a nonpublic audit of ComEd in May 2021 evaluating ComEd&#8217;s compliance with (1) approved terms, rates and conditions of its transmission formula rate mechanism; (2) accounting requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts; (3) reporting requirements of the FERC Form 1; and (4) the requirements for record retention. The audit covered the period from January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2022. On January 17, 2023, ComEd was provided with information on a series of potential findings, including concerning ComEd's \n\nmethodology regarding the allocation of certain overhead costs to capital under FERC regulations. The final outcome and resolution of the findings or of the audit itself cannot be predicted and the results, while not reasonably estimable at this time, could be material to the Exelon and ComEd financial statements. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nOther Key Business Drivers and Management Strategies Utility Rates and Rate Proceedings \n\nThe Utility Registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants&#8217; current and future results of operations, cash flows, and financial positions. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these regulatory proceedings. \n\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments \n\nCity of Chicago Franchise Agreement \n\nThe current ComEd Franchise Agreement with the City of Chicago (the City) has been in force since 1992. The Franchise Agreement grants rights to use the public right of way to install, maintain, and operate the wires, poles, and other infrastructure required to deliver electricity to residents and businesses across the City. The Franchise Agreement became terminable on one year notice as of December 31, 2020. It now continues in effect indefinitely unless and until either party issues a notice of termination, effective one year later, or it is replaced by mutual agreement with a new franchise agreement between ComEd and the City. If either party terminates and no new agreement is reached between the parties, the parties could continue with ComEd providing electric services within the City with no franchise agreement in place. The City also has an option to terminate and purchase the ComEd system (&#8220;municipalize&#8221;), which also requires one year notice. Neither party has issued a notice of termination at this time, the City has not exercised its municipalization option, and no new agreement has become effective. Accordingly, the 1992 Franchise Agreement remains in effect at this time. In April 2021, the City invited interested parties to respond to a Request for Information (RFI) regarding the franchise for electricity delivery. Final responses to the RFI were due on July 30, 2021, however, on July 29, 2021, the City chose to extend the final submission deadline to September 30, 2021. ComEd submitted its response to the RFI by the due date. However, the City did not proceed to issue an RFP. Since that time, ComEd and the City continued to negotiate and have arrived at a proposed Chicago Franchise Agreement (CFA) and an Energy and Equity Agreement (EEA). These agreements together are intended to grant ComEd the right to continue providing electric utility services using public ways within the City of Chicago, and to create a new non-profit entity to advance energy and energy-related equity projects. On February 1, 2023, the proposed CFA and EEA were introduced to the City Council. The proposed CFA and EEA remain subject to approval by the City Council and the Exelon Board. \n\nWhile Exelon and ComEd cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these processes, fundamental changes in the agreements or other adverse actions affecting ComEd&#8217;s business in the City would require changes in their business planning models and operations and could have a material adverse impact on Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. If the City were to disconnect from the ComEd system, ComEd would seek full compensation for the business and its associated property taken by the City, as well as for all damages resulting to ComEd and its system. ComEd would also seek appropriate compensation for stranded costs with FERC. \n\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \n\nOn November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. IIJA provides for approximately $550 billion in new federal spending. Categories of funding include funding for a variety of infrastructure needs, including but not limited to: (1) power and grid reliability and resilience, (2) resilience for cybersecurity to address critical infrastructure needs, and (3) electric vehicle charging infrastructure for alternative fuel corridors. Federal agencies are developing guidelines to implement spending programs under IIJA. The time needed to develop these guidelines will vary with some limited program applications opened as early as the first quarter of 2022. The Registrants are continuing to analyze the legislation and considering possible opportunities to apply for funding, either directly or in potential collaborations with state and/or local \n\nagencies and key stakeholders. The Registrants cannot predict the ultimate timing and success of securing funding from programs under IIJA. \n\nComEd and BGE applied for the Middle Mile Grant (MMG), which establishes and funds construction, improvement, or acquisition of middle mile broadband infrastructure which creates high-speed internet services. The MMG addresses inequitable broadband access by expansion and extension of the middle mile infrastructure in underserved communities. ComEd and BGE cannot predict if their applications will be approved as filed or the timing of receiving any funds if they are awarded a grant. \n\nIn December 2022, Exelon and the Utility Registrants submitted 14 concept papers in response to the Department of Energy's Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. These concept papers are focused on delivering grid resilience and grid benefits to customers and communities across the Exelon footprint. Eleven of the fourteen opportunities received letters of encouragement to submit applications due in the first half of 2023. Exelon cannot predict if their applications will be approved as filed or the timing of receiving any funds if they are awarded a grant. \n\nExelon and the Utility Registrants are supporting three different Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub opportunities, covering all five states that Exelon operates in plus Washington D.C., that have submitted concept papers to the Department of Energy. All three opportunities have received letters of encouragement from Department of Energy to submit applications due in April 2023. The program will create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier that can deliver or store energy. Exelon cannot predict if their applications will be approved as filed or the timing of receiving any funds if they are awarded a grant. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. Management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Additional information on the application of these accounting policies can be found in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, and PHI) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Exelon&#8217;s $6.6 billion carrying amount of goodwill consists of $2.6 billion at ComEd and $4 billion at PHI. These entities are required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is assessed for impairment. ComEd has a single operating segment and reporting unit. PHI&#8217;s operating segments and reporting units are Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 5 &#8212; Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Exelon's and ComEd&#8217;s goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit. Exelon's and PHI&#8217;s goodwill has been assigned to the Pepco, DPL, and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively. See Note 12 &#8212; Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nEntities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed. \n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment assessment requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market \n\nperformance and transactions, and projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd&#8217;s, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's businesses and the fair value of debt. \n\nWhile the 2022 annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used in the assessment are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon&#8217;s, ComEd's, or PHI&#8217;s goodwill, which could be material. \n\nSee Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 &#8212; Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nUnamortized Energy Contract Liabilities (Exelon and PHI) \n\nUnamortized energy contract liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative electricity contracts that Exelon acquired as part of the PHI merger. The initial amount recorded represents the difference between the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition and the contract value based on the terms of each contract. Offsetting regulatory assets were also recorded for those energy contract costs that are probable of recovery through customer rates. The unamortized energy contract liabilities and the corresponding regulatory assets, respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows. Amortization of the unamortized energy contract liabilities are recorded through purchased power and fuel expense. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 12 &#8212; Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nDepreciable Lives of Property, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants have significant investments in electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. These assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis, using the group, or composite methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. The estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment, supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically and as required by a rate regulator or regulatory action, or changes in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary. \n\nDepreciation studies generally serve as the basis for amounts allowed in customer rates for recovery of depreciation costs. Generally, the Registrants adjust their depreciation rates for financial reporting purposes concurrent with adjustments to depreciation rates reflected in customer rates, unless the depreciation rates reflected in customer rates do not align with management&#8217;s judgment as to an appropriate estimated useful life or have not been updated on a timely basis. Depreciation expense and customer rates for ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE include an estimate of the future costs of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding regulatory liabilities and assets recorded by ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE related to removal costs. \n\nPECO&#8217;s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO&#8217;s regulatory recovery method. Estimates for such removal costs are also evaluated in the periodic depreciation studies. \n\nChanges in estimated useful lives of electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets could have a significant impact on the Registrants&#8217; future results of operations. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant, and equipment of the Registrants. \n\nRetirement Benefits (All Registrants) \n\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for substantially all current employees. The measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, Exelon's contributions, the rate of \n\ncompensation increases, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. The assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations. \n\nPension and OPEB plan assets include equity securities, including U.S. and international securities, and fixed income securities, as well as certain alternative investment classes such as real estate, private equity, and hedge funds. \n\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets. In determining the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectation regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon&#8217;s target asset class allocations. Exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and OPEB plan assets by multiplying the EROA by the MRV of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. In determining MRV, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. For the majority of pension plan assets, Exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected MRV of plan assets. Use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. For OPEB plan assets and certain pension plan assets, Exelon uses fair value to calculate the MRV. \n\nDiscount Rate. The discount rates are determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and OPEB obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and OPEB plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. Exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates. \n\nMortality. The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. Exelon&#8217;s mortality assumption utilizes the SOA 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2021 improvement scale adjusted to use Proxy SSA ultimate improvement rates. \n\nSensitivity to Changes in Key Assumptions. The following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant: \n\n##TABLE_START Actual Assumption Actuarial Assumption Pension OPEB Change in Assumption Pension OPEB Total Change in 2022 cost: Discount rate (a) \n\n3.24% 3.20% 0.5% $ (16) $ (2) $ (18) 3.24% 3.20% (0.5)% 31 7 38 EROA 7.00% 6.44% 0.5% (54) (7) (61) 7.00% 6.44% (0.5)% 54 7 61 Change in benefit obligation at December 31, 2022: Discount rate (a) \n\n5.53% 5.51% 0.5% (508) (83) (591) 5.53% 5.51% (0.5)% 655 104 759 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) In general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and OPEB cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. Additionally, Exelon utilizes a liability-driven investment strategy for its pension asset portfolio. The sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns. \n\nSee Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans. \n\nRegulatory Accounting (All Registrants) \n\nFor their regulated electric and gas operations, the Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities&#8217; cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent (1) revenue or gains that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. If it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of operations no longer meets the criteria discussed above, the Registrants would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact, which could be material, would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nThe following table illustrates gains (losses) to be included in net income that could result from the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities and charges against OCI related to deferred costs associated with Exelon's pension and OPEB plans that are recorded as regulatory assets in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets (before taxes) as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Gain (loss) $ 2,461 $ 3,697 $ (387) $ 159 $ (978) $ (211) $ 142 $ (442) \n\nCharge against OCI (a) \n\n(2,590) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________ \n\n(a) Exelon's charge against OCI (before taxes) consists of up to $1.9 billion, $347 million, $492 million, $279 million, $113 million, and $59 million related to ComEd's, BGE's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's respective portions of the deferred costs associated with Exelon's pension and OPEB plans. Exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $115 million (before taxes) related to PECO&#8217;s portion of the deferred costs associated with Exelon&#8217;s OPEB plans that would result in an increase in OCI if reversed. \n\nSee Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities of the Registrants. \n\nFor each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, the Registrants assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or refund at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each Registrant's jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. If the assessments and estimates made by the Registrants for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact in their consolidated financial statements could be material. \n\nRefer to the revenue recognition discussion below for additional information on the annual revenue reconciliations associated with ICC-approved electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rates for ComEd, and FERC transmission formula rate tariffs for the Utility Registrants. \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nDetermining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlying and one or more notional quantities. \n\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, NPNS. For derivatives that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value each period are initially recorded in AOCI and recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction \n\naffects earnings. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, which are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value each period are recognized in earnings on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income or are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability when there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs or benefits in accordance with regulatory requirements. \n\nNPNS. Contracts that are designated as NPNS are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. Determining whether a contract qualifies for NPNS requires judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all the associated qualification and documentation requirements. For all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts payable is recorded when derivatives settle and expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is consumed. Contracts that qualify for NPNS are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period, and the contract is not financially settled on a net basis. The contracts that ComEd has entered into with suppliers as part of ComEd&#8217;s energy procurement process, PECO&#8217;s full requirement contracts under the PAPUC-approved DSP program, most of PECO&#8217;s natural gas supply agreements, all of BGE&#8217;s full requirement contracts and natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives, and certain Pepco, DPL, and ACE full requirement contracts qualify for and are accounted for under NPNS. \n\nCommodity Contracts. The Registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, interest rates, and the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows in deciding whether to enter derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. The Registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. \n\nDerivative contracts can be traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are generally categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivative pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, online exchanges. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, the model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs and are categorized in Level 3. \n\nThe Registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts, and both historical and current market data in the assessment of nonperformance risk. The impacts of nonperformance and credit risk to date have generally not been material to the Registrants&#8217; financial statements. \n\nInterest Rate Derivative Instruments. Exelon Corporate utilizes interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on existing and planned future debt issuances as well as potential fluctuations in Electric operating revenues at the corporate level in consolidation, which are directly correlated to yields on U.S. Treasury bonds under ComEd's distribution formula rate. The fair value of the swaps is calculated by discounting the future net cash flows to the present value based on the terms and conditions of the agreements and the forward interest rate curves. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate derivatives are primarily categorized in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK and Note 17 &#8212; Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants&#8217; derivative instruments. \n\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants) \n\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the Registrants&#8217; provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has \n\nbeen met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the Registrants&#8217; consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe Registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Registrants also assess negative evidence, such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, that could indicate the Registrant's inability to realize its deferred tax assets. Based on the combined assessment, the Registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods. \n\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, the Registrants&#8217; forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. See Note 13 &#8212; Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies (All Registrants) \n\nIn the preparation of their financial statements, the Registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. The amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. Such difference could have a significant impact in the Registrants' consolidated financial statements. \n\nEnvironmental Costs. Environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the Registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work, regulations, and the requirements of local governmental authorities. Annual studies and/or reviews are conducted at ComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL to determine future remediation requirements for MGP sites and estimates are adjusted accordingly. In addition, periodic reviews are performed at each of the Registrants to assess the adequacy of other environmental reserves. These matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant impact in the Registrants&#8217; consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nOther, Including Personal Injury Claims. The Registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers&#8217; compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. The Registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted, and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). The IBNR reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. Accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material impact to the Registrants&#8217; consolidated financial statements. \n\nRevenues (All Registrants) \n\nSources of Revenue and Determination of Accounting Treatment. The Registrants earn revenues from the sale and delivery of power and natural gas in regulated markets. The accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance. The Registrants primarily apply the Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and Alternative Revenue Program accounting guidance to recognize revenues as discussed in more detail below. \n\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. The Registrants recognize revenues in the period in which the performance obligations within contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when power and natural gas are physically delivered to the customer. Transactions of the Registrants within the scope of Revenue from Contracts with Customers generally include sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs. \n\nThe determination of the Registrants' power and natural gas sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters, generally monthly. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. The measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. Increases or decreases in volumes delivered to the Registrant&#8217;s customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, revenues may fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternative supplier, since unbilled commodity revenues are not recorded for these customers. Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date also impact the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged. See Note 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nAlternative Revenue Program Accounting. Certain of the Registrants&#8217; ratemaking mechanisms qualify as ARPs if they (i) are established by a regulatory order and allow for automatic adjustment to future rates, (ii) provide for additional revenues (above those amounts currently reflected in the price of utility service) that are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and (iii) allow for the collection of those additional revenues within 24 months following the end of the period in which they were recognized. For mechanisms that meet these criteria, which include the Registrants&#8217; formula rate mechanisms and revenue decoupling mechanisms, the Registrants adjust revenue and record an offsetting regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing additional billing or refund has occurred. The ARP revenues presented in the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include both: (i) the recognition of &#8220;originating&#8221; ARP revenues (when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred) and (ii) an equal and offsetting reversal of the &#8220;originating&#8221; ARP revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of utility service and recognized as Revenue from Contracts with Customers. \n\nComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, distributed generation rebates, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC, DCPSC, and/or NJBPU in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. Estimates of the current year revenue requirement are based on actual and/or forecasted costs and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. The estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred, investments made, allowed ROE, and actions by regulators or courts. \n\nSee Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Customer Accounts Receivable (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants estimate the allowance for credit losses on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Risk segments represent a group of customers with similar forward-looking credit quality indicators and risk factors that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history and represent expected, future customer behavior. Loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on a historical average of charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. The Registrants' customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. The Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. The Registrants' allowances for credit losses will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices, and economic conditions as well as changes in ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU regulations. \n\nComEd \n\nResults of Operations by Registrant \n\nResults of Operations&#8212;ComEd \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (Unfavorable) Favorable Variance Operating revenues $ 5,761 $ 6,406 $ (645) Operating expenses Purchased power 1,109 2,271 1,162 Operating and maintenance 1,412 1,355 (57) Depreciation and amortization 1,323 1,205 (118) Taxes other than income taxes 374 320 (54) Total operating expenses 4,218 5,151 933 Gain on sales of assets (2) &#8212; (2) Operating income 1,541 1,255 286 Other income and (deductions) Interest expense, net (414) (389) (25) Other, net 54 48 6 Total other income and (deductions) (360) (341) (19) Income before income taxes 1,181 914 267 Income taxes 264 172 (92) Net income $ 917 $ 742 $ 175 ##TABLE_END\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 . Net income increased by $175 million primarily due to increases in electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base). \n\nThe changes in Operating revenues consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Increase (Decrease) Distribution $ 310 Transmission 65 Energy efficiency 65 Other 12 452 Regulatory required programs (1,097) \n\nTo tal decrease \n\n$ (645) ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue Decoupling. The demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. Operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer, or number of customers as a result of revenue decoupling mechanisms implemented pursuant to FEJA. \n\nDistribution Revenue. EIMA and FEJA provide for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs (e.g., severe weather and storm restoration), investments being recovered, and allowed ROE. Electric distribution revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, due to higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates, the impact of a higher rate base, and higher fully recoverable costs. \n\nComEd \n\nTransmission Revenue. Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recov ered, and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in January based on the prior calendar year. Generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. T ransmission revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the impact of a higher rate base and higher fully recoverable costs. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Revenue. FEJA provides for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. Under FEJA, energy efficiency revenue varies from year to year based upon fl uctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, and allowed ROE. Energy efficiency revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates, the impact of a higher rate base, and increased regulatory asset amortization, which is fully recoverable. \n\nOther Revenue primarily includes assistance provided to other utili ties through mutual assistance programs. Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, which primarily reflects mutual assistance revenues associated with storm restoration efforts. \n\nRegulatory Required Programs represents revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as recoveries under the credit loss expense tariff, environmental costs associated with MGP sites, ETAC, and costs related to electricity, ZEC, CMC, and REC procurement. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding CMCs. ETAC is a retail customer surcharge collected by electric utilities operating in Illinois established by CEJA and remitted to an Illinois state agency for programs to support clean energy jobs and training. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. The costs of these programs are included in Purchased power expense, Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Taxes other than income. Customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries as ComEd remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in Operating revenues. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from competitive suppliers, ComEd either acts as the billing agent or the competitive supplier separately bills its own customers, and therefore does not record Operating revenues or Purchased power expense related to the electricity. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from ComEd, ComEd is permitted to recover the electricity, ZEC, CMC, and REC procurement costs without mark-up and therefore records equal and offsetting amounts in Operating revenues and Purchased power expense related to the electricity, ZECs, CMCs, and RECs. \n\nSee Note 5 &#8212; Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the presentation of ComEd's revenue disaggregation. \n\nThe decrease of $1,162 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, in Purchased power expense is primarily due to the CMCs from the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities. This favorability is offset by a decrease in Operating revenues as part of regulatory required programs. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding CMCs. \n\nComEd \n\nThe changes in Operating and maintenance expense consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Increase (Decrease) Labor, other benefits, contracting, and materials $ 57 Storm-related costs 13 BSC Costs 13 Pension and non-pension postretirement benefits expense (30) Other 5 58 \n\nRegulatory required programs (a) \n\n(1) Total increase $ 57 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) ComEd is allowed to recover from or refund to customers the difference between its annual credit loss expense and the amounts collected in rates annually through a rider mechanism. \n\nThe changes in Depreciation and amortization expense consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Increase \n\nDepreciation and amortization (a) \n\n$ 63 \n\nRegulatory asset amortization (b) \n\n55 Total increase $ 118 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Reflects ongoing capital expenditures. \n\n(b) Includes amortization of ComEd's energy efficiency formula rate regulatory asset. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased by $54 million for the year December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to taxes related to ETAC, which is recovered through Operating revenues. \n\nInterest expense, net increased $25 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the issuance of debt in 2021 and 2022. \n\nEffective income tax rates were 22.4% and 18.8% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Net income increased by $72 million, primarily due to increases in electric and gas distribution rates and a decrease in storm costs, partially offset by the one-time non-cash impacts associated with the Pennsylvania corporate income tax legislation passed in July 2022, and increases in depreciation expense, credit loss expense, and interest expense. \n\nThe changes in Operating revenues consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Increase (Decrease) Electric Gas Total Weather $ 32 $ 10 $ 42 Volume (21) 8 (13) Pricing 138 25 163 Transmission 15 &#8212; 15 Other 15 6 21 179 49 228 Regulatory required programs 327 150 477 Total increase $ 506 $ 199 $ 705 ##TABLE_END\n\nWeather. The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as &#8220;favorable weather conditions&#8221; because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. For the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Operating revenues related to weather increased due to the impact of favorable weather conditions in PECO's service territory. \n\nHeating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in PECO&#8217;s service territory. The changes in heating and cooling degree days in PECO&#8217;s service territory for the years ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 and normal weather consisted of the following: \n\nPECO \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Years Ended December 31, &#160; % Change PECO Service Territory 2022 2021 Normal 2022 vs. 2021 2022 vs. Normal Heating Degree-Days 4,135 3,946 4,408 4.8 % (6.2) % Cooling Degree-Days 1,743 1,586 1,443 9.9 % 20.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nVolume.

Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs and capital investments being recovered. Transmission revenue remained relatively consistent for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. \n\nOther Revenue includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, mutual assistance revenues, and recoveries of other taxes. \n\nRegulatory Required Programs represent revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs, DC PLUG, and SOS procurement and administrative costs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs are included in Purchased power expense, Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Taxes other than income taxes. Customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries, as Pepco remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in Operating revenues. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from competitive suppliers, Pepco acts as the billing agent and therefore, Pepco does not record Operating revenues or Purchased power expense related to the electricity. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from Pepco, Pepco is permitted to recover the electricity and REC procurement costs from customers and therefore records the amounts related to the electricity and RECs in Operating revenues and Purchased power expense. Pepco recovers electricity and REC procurement costs from customers with a slight mark-up. \n\nSee Note 5 &#8212; Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the presentation of Pepco's revenue disaggregation. \n\nThe increase of $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, in Purchased power expense is fully offset in Operating revenues as part of regulatory required programs. \n\nPepco \n\nThe changes in Operating and maintenance expense consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Increase (Decrease) Credit loss expense $ 17 BSC and PHISCO costs 13 Storm-related costs 8 Labor, other benefits, contracting, and materials (2) Other (6) 30 Regulatory required programs 6 Total increase $ 36 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe changes in Depreciation and amortization expense consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 vs. 2021 Increase (Decrease) \n\nDepreciation and amortization (a) \n\n$ 14 Regulatory asset amortization (3) Regulatory required programs 3 Total increase $ 14 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to an increase in property taxes and gross receipts taxes. \n\nInterest expense, net increased $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to the issuance of debt in 2021 and 2022 and increases in interest rates. \n\nOther , net increased $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher AFUDC equity. \n\nEffective income tax rates were (3.0)% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. However, Operating revenues from electric distribution in Maryland are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer as a result of a BSA that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer by customer class. While Operating revenues from electric distribution customers in Maryland are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer, they are impacted by changes in the number of customers. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on revenue decoupling for DPL Maryland. \n\nWeather. The demand for electricity and natural gas in Delaware is affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as \"favorable weather conditions&#8221; because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Operating revenues related to weather increased due to favorable weather conditions in DPL's Delaware natural gas service territory. \n\nDPL \n\nHeating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. Normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in DPL's Delaware electric service territory and a 30-year period in DPL's Delaware natural gas service territory.

Under a FERC-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs and capital investments being recovered. Transmission revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increases in underlying costs. \n\nOther Revenue includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, mutual assistance revenues, and recoveries of other taxes. \n\nRegulatory Required Programs represent revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs, DE Renewable Portfolio Standards, SOS procurement and administrative costs, and GCR costs. The riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return in certain instances. The costs of these programs are included in Purchased power and fuel expense, Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Taxes other than income taxes. All customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers; however, only certain commercial and industrial customers have the choice to purchase natural gas from competitive natural gas suppliers. Customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries as DPL remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in Operating revenues. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from competitive suppliers, DPL either acts as the billing agent or the competitive supplier separately bills its own customers, and therefore does not record Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas.

The demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. However, Operating revenues from electric distribution in New Jersey are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer as a result of the CIP which became effective, prospectively, in the third quarter of 2021. The CIP compares current distribution revenues by customer class to approved target revenues established in ACE&#8217;s most recent distribution base rate case. The CIP is calculated annually, and recovery is subject to certain conditions, including an earnings test and ceilings on customer rate increases. While Operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer, they are impacted by changes in the number of customers. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ACE CIP. \n\nWeather. Prior to the third quarter of 2021, the demand for electricity was affected by weather conditions. With respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and very cold weather in winter months are referred to as &#8220;favorable weather conditions&#8221; because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity. Conversely, mild weather reduces demand. During the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, Operating revenues related to weather decreased due to the absence of favorable impacts in the first and second quarter of 2022 as a result of the CIP. \n\nACE \n\nHeating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business.

The Registrants&#8217; businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. Each of the Registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices, and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, and fund pension and OPEB obligations. The Registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the Utility Registrants operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. Each Registrant&#8217;s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the Registrants have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $4.0 billion, as of December 31, 2022. The Registrants utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings, and to issue letters of credit. See the &#8220;Credit Matters and Cash Requirements&#8221; section below for additional information. The Registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs, and capital expenditure requirements. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Registrants&#8217; debt and credit agreements. \n\nCash flows related to Generation have not been presented as discontinued operations and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented. The Exelon Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes one month of cash flows from Generation. The Exelon Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes twelve months of cash flows from Generation. This is the primary reason for the changes in cash flows as shown in the tables unless otherwise noted below. \n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nThe Utility Registrants' cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of PECO, BGE, and DPL, gas distribution services. The Utility Registrants' distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. The Utility Registrants' future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions. Additionally, ComEd is required to purchase CMCs from participating nuclear-powered generating facilities for a five-year period, and all of its costs of doing so will be recovered through a new rider. The price to be paid for each CMC is established through a competitive bidding process. ComEd will provide net payments to, or collect net payments from, customers for the difference between customer credits issued and the credit to be received from the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities. ComEd&#8217;s cash flows are affected by the establishment of CMC prices and the timing of recovering costs through the CMC regulatory asset. \n\nSee Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation. \n\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by Registrant: \n\n##TABLE_START Increase (decrease) in cash flows from operating activities Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Net income $ 342 $ 175 $ 72 $ (28) $ 47 $ 9 $ 41 $ 2 Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash: Non-cash operating activities (2,382) (176) 124 173 259 93 25 141 Option premiums paid, net 299 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Collateral received (posted), net 1,322 51 &#8212; 16 99 22 35 42 Income taxes (331) &#8212; (25) (37) (18) (30) (13) 11 Pension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions 49 12 &#8212; 13 (30) &#8212; &#8212; (4) Regulatory assets and liabilities, net (692) (645) (24) (8) (37) 12 9 (43) Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities 3,251 185 (79) (98) (227) (97) (64) (60) Increase (decrease) in cash flows from operating activities $ 1,858 $ (398) $ 68 $ 31 $ 93 $ 9 $ 33 $ 89 ##TABLE_END\n\nChanges in the Registrants' cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each Registrant&#8217;s respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below.

Significant operating cash flow impacts for the Registrants and Generation for 2022 and 2021 were as follows: \n\n&#8226; See Note 22 &#8212;Supplemental Financial Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional information on non-cash operating activities . \n\n&#8226; Changes in collateral depended upon whether Generation was in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, and collateral may have been required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties. In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differed depending on whether the transactions were on an exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. Changes in collateral for the Utility Registrants are dependent upon the credit exposure of procurement contracts that may require suppliers to post collateral. The amount of cash collateral received from external counterparties increased due to rising energy prices. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. \n\n&#8226; See Note 13 &#8212; Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional information on income taxes. \n\n&#8226; Changes in regulatory assets and liabilities, net, are due to the timing of cash payments for costs recoverable, or cash receipts for costs recovered, under our regulatory mechanisms differs from the recovery period of those costs. Included within the changes is energy efficiency spend for ComEd of $394 million and $343 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Also included within the changes is energy efficiency and demand response programs spend for BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE of $113 million, $71 million, $28 million, and $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and $107 million, $72 million, $29 million, and $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. PECO had no energy efficiency and demand response programs spend recorded to a regulatory asset for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Changes in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities for the Utility Registrants and Exelon Corporate total $(304) million and for Generation total $3,555 million. The change for Generation primarily relates to the revolving accounts receivable financing arrangement. See the Collection of DPP discussion below for additional information. The change in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities for Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants is dependent upon the normal course of operations for all Registrants. For ComEd, it is also \n\ndependent upon whether the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities owe money to ComEd as a result of the established pricing for CMCs. In 2022, the established pricing resulted in a receivable from nuclear-powered generating facilities, which is reported within the cash flows from operations as a change in accounts receivable. In future periods the established pricing could result in ComEd owing payments to nuclear-powered generating facilities, which would be reported within cash flows from operations as a change in accounts payable and accrued expenses. \n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by Registrant: \n\n##TABLE_START Increase (decrease) in cash flows from investing activities Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Capital expenditures $ 834 $ (119) $ (109) $ (36) $ 11 $ (31) $ (1) $ 47 Investment in NDT fund sales, net 113 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Collection of DPP (3,733) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Proceeds from sales of assets and businesses (861) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Other investing activities (26) 2 (1) (7) 4 4 (1) &#8212; (Decrease) increase in cash flows from investing activities $ (3,673) $ (117) $ (110) $ (43) $ 15 $ (27) $ (2) $ 47 ##TABLE_END\n\nSignificant investing cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2022 and 2021 were as follows: \n\n&#8226; Variances in capital expenditures are primarily due to the timing of cash expenditures for capital projects. See the \"Credit Matters and Cash Requirements\" section below for additional information on projected capital expenditure spending for the Utility Registrants. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for capital expenditures related to Generation prior to the separation. \n\n&#8226; Collection of DPP relates to Generation's revolving accounts receivable financing agreement which Generation entered into in April 2020. Generation received $400 million of additional funding related to the DPP in February and March of 2021. \n\n&#8226; Proceeds from sales of assets and businesses decreased primarily due to the sale of a significant portion of Generation's solar business and a biomass facility in 2021. \n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \n\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by Registrant: \n\n##TABLE_START (Decrease) increase in cash flows from financing activities Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Changes in short-term borrowings, net $ (513) $ 900 $ 239 $ 148 $ (154) $ (16) $ (37) $ (101) Long-term debt, net 2,395 (50) (25) (50) 50 40 &#8212; 10 Changes in intercompany money pool &#8212; &#8212; 40 &#8212; 51 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Issuance of common stock 563 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Dividends paid on common stock 163 (71) (60) (8) &#8212; (195) 4 143 Acquisition of noncontrolling interest 885 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Distributions to member &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; (47) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Contributions from parent/member &#8212; (121) (140) 29 104 221 27 (144) Transfer of cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents to Constellation (2,594) &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Other financing activities (66) 5 (6) (5) (5) (4) &#8212; &#8212; Increase (decrease) in cash flows from financing activities $ 833 $ 663 $ 48 $ 114 $ (1) $ 46 $ (6) $ (92) ##TABLE_END\n\nSignificant financing cash flow impacts for the Registrants for 2022 and 2021 were as follows: \n\n&#8226; Changes in short-term borrowings, net , are driven by repayments on and issuances of notes due in less than 365 days. Refer to Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on short-term borrowings for the Registrants. These changes also included repayments of $552 million in commercial paper and term loans by Generation prior to the separation. \n\n&#8226; Long-term debt, net, varies due to debt issuances and redemptions each year. Refer to the debt issuances and redemptions tables below for additional information for the Registrants. \n\n&#8226; Changes in intercompany money pool are driven by short-term borrowing needs. Refer below for more information regarding the intercompany money pool. \n\n&#8226; Issuance of common stock relates to the August 2022 underwritten public offering of Exelon common stock. See Note 19 &#8212; Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Exelon&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the receipt of dividends paid by its operating subsidiaries. The payments of dividends to Exelon by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings. See Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on dividend restrictions. See below for quarterly dividends declared. \n\n&#8226; Acquisition of noncontrolling interest relates to Generation's acquisition of CENG noncontrolling interest in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Refer to Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations for the transfer of cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents to Constellation related to the separation. \n\n&#8226; Other financing activities primarily consists of debt issuance costs.

The 2023 quarterly dividend will be $0.36 per share. \n\nCredit Matters and Cash Requirements \n\nThe Registrants fund liquidity needs for capital expenditures, working capital, energy hedging, and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets, and large, diversified credit facilities. The credit facilities include $4.0 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $2.1 billion was available to support additional commercial paper as of December 31, 2022, and of which no financial institution has more than 6% of the aggregate commitments for the Registrants. On February 1, 2022, Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants each entered into a new 5-year revolving credit facility that replaced its existing syndicated revolving credit facility. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Registrants had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under their revolving credit facilities during 2022 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. The Registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. The Registrants closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising, and merger activity. See PART I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets. \n\nThe Registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets, and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to support the estimated future cash requirements discussed below. \n\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon entered into an agreement with certain underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering of 12.995 million shares of its common stock, no par value. The net proceeds were $ 563 million before expenses paid. Exelon used the proceeds, together with available cash balances, to repay $ 575 million in borrowings under a $ 1.15 billion term loan credit facility. See Note 19 &#8212; Shareholders' Equity and Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon executed an equity distribution agreement (&#8220;Equity Distribution Agreement&#8221;) with certain sales agents and forward sellers and certain forward purchasers establishing an ATM equity distribution program under which it may offer and sell shares of its common stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $ 1.0 billion. Exelon has no obligation to offer or sell any shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend or terminate offers and sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, Exelon has not issued any shares of common stock under the ATM program and has not entered into any forward sale agreements. \n\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement between Exelon and Constellation Energy Corporation, Exelon made a cash payment of $1.75 billion to Generation on January 31, 2022. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the separation. \n\nThe following table presents the incremental collateral that each Utility Registrant would have been required to provide in the event each Utility Registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2022 and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START PJM Credit Policy Collateral Other Incremental Collateral Required (a) \n\nAvailable Credit Facility Capacity Prior to Any Incremental Collateral ComEd $ 31 $ &#8212; $ 568 &#160; PECO 1 71 &#160; 361 &#160; BGE 3 119 &#160; 191 &#160; Pepco 5 &#8212; 1 &#160; DPL 6 15 &#160; 185 &#160; ACE 2 &#8212; 300 &#160; ##TABLE_END __________ \n\n(a) Represents incremental collateral related to natural gas procurement contracts. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n(in millions) (a) \n\n2023 Transmission 2023 Distribution 2023 Gas Total 2023 Beyond 2023 (b) \n\nExelon N/A N/A N/A $ 7,175 $ 24,100 ComEd 475 2,075 N/A 2,550 8,575 PECO 75 975 325 1,375 4,825 BGE 325 525 475 1,325 4,700 PHI 550 1,225 125 1,900 6,000 Pepco 250 650 N/A 900 2,825 DPL 175 275 125 575 1,800 ACE 150 300 N/A 425 1,400 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________ \n\n(a) Numbers rounded to the nearest $25M and may not sum due to rounding. \n\n(b) Includes estimated capital expenditures for the Utility Registrants from 2024 and 2026. \n\nProjected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. Projected capital expenditures at the Utility Registrants are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems. The Utility Registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital \n\nexpenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent. \n\nRetirement Benefits \n\nManagement considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation, and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an ABO basis over time. This funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Exelon&#8217;s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be $ 20 million in 2023. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon&#8217;s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. \n\nWhile OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans. For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon&#8217;s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid, and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery).

PECO meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL, and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the PHI intercompany money pool. P HI Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the Exelon intercompany money pool. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. \n\nSee Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Registrants&#8217; credit facilities and short term borrowing activity. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the capital structures of the Registrants consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START Exelon (a) \n\nComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Long-term debt 57 % 43 % 44 % 44 % 41 % 48 % 48 % 50 % \n\nLong-term debt to affiliates (b) \n\n1 % 1 % 2 % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % Common equity 38 % 54 % 52 % 52 % &#8212; % 48 % 49 % 50 % Member&#8217;s equity &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 57 % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % Commercial paper and notes payable 4 % 2 % 2 % 4 % 2 % 4 % 3 % &#8212; % ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) As of December 31, 2021, Exelon's Long-term debt and Common equity capital structure percentages were 50% and 45%, respectively. The change in capital structure percentages above is a result of a decrease in common equity due to the separation of Constellation in addition to an increase in long-term debt issuances. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations for additional information regarding the separation. \n\n(b) Includes approximately $ 390 million, $ 205 million, and $ 184 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of Exelon, ComEd, and PECO respectively. These special purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities of ComEd and PECO. \n\nSecurity Ratings \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading of a Registrant&#8217;s securities could increase fees and interest charges under that Registrant&#8217;s credit agreements. \n\nAs part of the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Registrants and their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the Registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of additional collateral. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral provisions. \n\nThe credit ratings for ComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL did not change for the year ended December 31, 2022. On January 14, 2022, Fitch lowered Exelon Corporate's long-term and senior unsecured ratings from BBB+ to BBB and affirmed the short-term rating of F2. In addition, Fitch upgraded Pepco, ACE, and PHI's long-term rating from BBB to BBB+ and upgraded Pepco and ACE's senior secured rating from A- to A. \n\nIntercompany Money Pool \n\nTo provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing, both Exelon and PHI operate an intercompany money pool. Maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of December 31, 2022, are presented in the following tables. ACE did not have any intercompany money pool activity as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2022 Exelon Intercompany Money Pool Maximum Contributed Maximum Borrowed Contributed (Borrowed) Exelon Corporate $ 396 $ &#8212; $ 182 PECO 138 (105) &#8212; BSC &#8212; (380) (183) PHI Corporate &#8212; (54) (44) PCI 50 &#8212; 45 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2022 PHI Intercompany Money Pool Maximum Contributed Maximum Borrowed Contributed (Borrowed) Pepco $ &#8212; $ (108) $ &#8212; DPL 108 &#8212; &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nShelf Registration Statements \n\nExelon and the Utility Registrants have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement, unlimited in amount, filed with the SEC on August 3, 2022, that will expire in August 2025. The ability of each Registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the Registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions. \n\nRegulatory Authorizations \n\nThe Utility Registrants are required to obtain short-term and long-term financing authority from Federal and State Commissions as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, 2022 Short-term Financing Authority Remaining Long-term Financing Authority Commission Expiration Date Amount Commission Expiration Date Amount \n\nComEd (a) \n\nFERC December 31, 2023 $ 2,500 ICC January 1, 2025 $ 1,343 \n\nPECO (b) \n\nFERC December 31, 2023 1,500 PAPUC December 31, 2024 1,125 \n\nBGE (c) \n\nFERC December 31, 2023 700 MDPSC N/A &#8212; \n\nPepco (d) \n\nFERC December 31, 2023 500 MDPSC / DCPSC 2022 &#38; 2025 1,400 \n\nDPL (e) \n\nFERC December 31, 2023 500 MDPSC / DEPSC December 31, 2025 1,200 \n\nACE (f) \n\nNJBPU December 31, 2023 350 NJBPU December 31, 2024 700 ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) On November 18, 2021, ComEd received approval from the ICC for $2 billion in new money long-term debt financing authority with an effective date of January 1, 2022. \n\n(b) On December 2, 2021, PECO received approval from the PAPUC for $2.5 billion in new long-term debt financing authority with an effective date of January 1, 2022. \n\n(c) On December 21, 2022, BGE received approval from the MDPSC for $1.8 billion in new long-term financing authority with an effective date of January 4, 2023. \n\n(d) On June 9, 2022 and June 30, 2022, Pepco received approval from the MDPSC and DCPSC, respectively, for $1.4 billion in new long-term financing authority.

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Registrants hold commodity and financial instruments that are exposed to the following market risks: \n\n&#8226; Commodity price risk, which is discussed further below. \n\n&#8226; Counterparty credit risk associated with non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments and participation in all, or some of the established, wholesale spot energy markets that are administered by PJM. The credit policies of PJM may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot energy market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of counterparty credit risk related to derivative instruments. \n\n&#8226; Equity price and interest rate risk associated with Exelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB plan trusts. See Note 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits of the 2021 Recast Form 10-K for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Interest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates for the Registrants&#8217; outstanding long-term debt. This risk is significantly reduced as substantially all of the Registrants&#8217; outstanding debt has fixed interest rates. There is inherent interest rate risk related to refinancing maturing debt by issuing new long-term debt. The Registrants use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, Exelon Corporate may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges, or to lock in rate levels on borrowings, which are typically designated as economic hedges. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Electric operating revenues risk associated with ComEd's distribution formula rate. ComEd's ROE for its electric distribution service through 2023 is directly correlated to yields on U.S. Treasury bonds. Exelon Corporate may utilize interest rate derivatives to mitigate volatility and manage risk to Exelon, which are typically accounted for as economic hedges. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nThe Registrants operate primarily under cost-based rate regulation limiting exposure to the effects of market risk. Hedging programs are utilized to reduce exposure to energy and natural gas price volatility and have no direct earnings impacts as the costs are fully recovered through regulatory-approved recovery mechanisms. \n\nExelon manages these risks through risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. Risk management issues are reported to Exelon&#8217;s Board of Directors, Exelon's Audit and Risk Committee, and/or the applicable Utility Board Registrant. The Registrants do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. \n\nCommodity Price Risk (All Registrants) \n\nCommodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy Exelon purchases differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon is exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices. Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity and natural gas. \n\nComEd entered into 20-year floating-to-fixed renewable energy swap contracts beginning in June 2012, which are considered an economic hedge and have changes in fair value recorded to an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. ComEd has block energy contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive \n\nprocurement process, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have certain full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Other full requirements contracts are not derivatives. \n\nPECO, BGE, and DPL also have executed derivative natural gas contracts, which qualify for NPNS, to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging programs for natural gas procurement have no direct impact on their financial statements. \n\nFor additional information on these contracts, see Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe following table presents maturity and source of fair value for Exelon's and ComEd's mark-to-market commodity contract liabilities. The table provides two fundamental pieces of information. First, the table provides the source of fair value used in determining the carrying amount of Exelon's and ComEd's total mark-to-market liabilities. Second, the table shows the maturity, by year, of Exelon's and ComEd's commodity contract liabilities giving an indication of when these mark-to-market amounts will settle and require cash. See Note 17 &#8212; Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy. \n\n##TABLE_START Maturities Within Total Fair Value \n\nCommodity derivative contracts (a) : \n\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 and Beyond Prices based on model or other valuation methods (Level 3) $ (5) $ (8) $ (11) $ (12) $ (13) $ (35) $ (84) ##TABLE_END _________ \n\n(a) Represents ComEd's net liabilities associated with the floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers. \n\n##TABLE_START "

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in the consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity&#8217;s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2022, there were $9.7 billion of regulatory assets and $9.5 billion of regulatory liabilities. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company&#8217;s accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort to assess the impact of regulation on accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities and to evaluate the complex audit evidence related to whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for regulatory matters and evaluation of new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company&#8217;s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s interpretation of regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and recalculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nChicago, Illinois \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2000. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Commonwealth Edison Company \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, of Commonwealth Edison Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(ii) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;).

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in the financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity&#8217;s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, \n\nrespectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2022, there were $704 million of regulatory assets and $863 million of regulatory liabilities. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company&#8217;s accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort to assess the impact of regulation on accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities and to evaluate the complex audit evidence related to whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for regulatory matters and evaluation of new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company&#8217;s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s interpretation of regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and recalculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nBaltimore, Maryland \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since at least 1993.

Significant Accounting Policies (All Registrants) \n\nDescription of Business (All Registrants) \n\nExelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. \n\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation. The separation was completed on February 1, 2022, creating two publicly traded companies, Exelon and Constellation. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_START Name of Registrant &#160; Business &#160; Service Territories Commonwealth Edison Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity Northern Illinois, including the City of Chicago Transmission and distribution of electricity to retail customers PECO Energy Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and natural gas Southeastern Pennsylvania, including the City of Philadelphia (electricity) Transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas to retail customers Pennsylvania counties surrounding the City of Philadelphia (natural gas) Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity and natural gas Central Maryland, including the City of Baltimore (electricity and natural gas) Transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas to retail customers Pepco Holdings LLC Utility services holding company engaged, through its reportable segments Pepco, DPL, and ACE Service Territories of Pepco, DPL, and ACE Potomac Electric Power Company &#160; Purchase and regulated retail sale of electricity &#160; District of Columbia, and major portions of Montgomery and Prince George&#8217;s Counties, Maryland.

The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the Registrants as indicated parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure. When appropriate, the Registrants are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures. Each of the Registrant&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated, except for the historical transactions between the Utility Registrants and Generation for the purposes of presenting discontinued operations in all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nThrough its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology, and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, finance, engineering, customer operations, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating companies. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon&#8217;s corporate operations are presented as &#8220;Other&#8221; within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Exelon owned 100 % of PECO, BGE, and PHI and more than 99 % of ComEd. PHI owns 100 % of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. As of December 31, 2021, Exelon owned 100 % of Generation. As of February 1, 2022, as a result of the completion of the separation, Exelon no longer owns any interest in Generation. The separation of Constellation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, meets the \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\ncriteria for discontinued operations and as such, its results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Accounting rules require that certain BSC costs previously allocated to Generation be presented as part of Exelon&#8217;s continuing operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations. Comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows related to Generation have not been segregated and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders&#8217; Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, for all periods presented. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations for additional information. \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. \n\nCOVID-19 (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak (pandemic) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The Registrants provide a critical service to their customers and have taken measures to keep employees who operate the business safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus, including extra precautions for employees who work in the field. The Registrants have implemented work from home policies where appropriate and imposed travel limitations on employees. \n\nManagement makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and accompanying notes, and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by those financial statements and accompanying notes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and through the date of this report, management assessed certain accounting matters that require consideration of forecasted financial information, including, but not limited to, allowance for credit losses and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets, in context with the information reasonably available and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19. The Registrants' future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to their consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. \n\nUse of Estimates (All Registrants) \n\nThe preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the accounting for pension and OPEB, unbilled energy revenues, allowance for credit losses, inventory reserves, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment assessments, derivative instruments, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, AROs, and taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nPrior Period Adjustments and Reclassifications (Exelon, PHI, ACE) \n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, management identified an error related to an overstatement of the regulatory liability associated with ACE&#8217;s mechanism to recover the cost of Transition Bonds issued in 2002 and 2003 by ACE Funding. Management has concluded that the error was not material to previously issued financial statements for Exelon, PHI or ACE. \n\nThe error was corrected through a revision to ACE&#8217;s financial statements contained herein. The impact of the error correction was an $ 8 million increase to ACE&#8217;s opening Retained earnings as of January 1, 2021 with a corresponding reduction to Regulatory liabilities of $ 11 million and an increase to Deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits of $ 3 million. The impact of the error to ACE&#8217;s Total operating revenues and Net income was less than $ 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The error did not impact net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used in investing activities or net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nThe error was corrected in the Exelon and PHI financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 as it was not material, resulting in an increase to Net income of $ 8 million. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\nRegulatory Accounting (All Registrants) \n\nFor their regulated electric and gas operations, the Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities&#8217; cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Registrants account for their regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU, under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense or revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. The Registrants' regulatory assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date are probable of being recovered or settled in future rates. If a separable portion of the Registrants' business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of regulation for that portion, which could have a material impact on their financial statements. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters for additional information. \n\nWith the exception of income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities, the Registrants classify regulatory assets and liabilities with a recovery or settlement period greater than one year as both current and noncurrent in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the current portion representing the amount expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers over the next twelve-month period as of the balance sheet date. Income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities are classified entirely as noncurrent in the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Balance Sheets to align with the classification of the related deferred income tax balances. \n\nThe Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order. \n\nRevenues (All Registrants) \n\nOperating Revenues. The Registrants&#8217; operating revenues generally consist of revenues from contracts with customers involving the sale and delivery of power and natural gas and utility revenues from ARP. The Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and natural gas tariff sales, distribution, and transmission services. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers. \n\nComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC, DCPSC, and/or NJBPU in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. The companies recognize all ARP revenues that will be collected within 24 months of the end of the annual period in which they are recorded. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters for additional information. \n\nTaxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions. The Registrants collect certain taxes from customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges, and fees, that are levied by state or local governments on the sale or distribution of electricity and gas. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. However, where these taxes are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other surcharges or fees, they are reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. Se e Note 22 &#8212; Supplemental Financial Information for taxes that are presented on a gross basis. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\nLeases (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases with a term of greater than one year. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other deferred debits and other assets and operating lease liabilities are included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in Plant, property, and equipment, net and finance lease liabilities are included in Long-term debt due within one year and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ROU asset is measured as the sum of (1) the present value of all remaining fixed and in-substance fixed payments using the rate implicit in the lease whenever that is readily determinable or each Registrant&#8217;s incremental borrowing rate, (2) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), and (3) any initial direct costs incurred. The lease liability is measured the same as the ROU asset, but excludes any payments made before the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Registrants include non-lease components for most asset classes, which are service-related costs that are not integral to the use of the asset, in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability. \n\nExpense for operating leases and leases with a term of one year or less is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the derivation of benefit from use of the leased property. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred. Operating lease expense, finance lease expense, and variable lease payments are primarily recorded to Operating and maintenance expense on the Registrants&#8217; Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nIncome from operating leases, including subleases, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which income is earned over the term of the lease. Variable lease income is recognized in the period in which the related obligation is performed. Operating lease income and variable lease income are recorded to Operating revenues on the Registrants&#8217; Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nThe Registrants&#8217; operating and finance leases consist primarily of real estate including office buildings and vehicles and equipment. The Registrants account for land right arrangements that provide for exclusive use as leases while shared use land arrangements are generally not leases. The Registrants do not account for secondary use pole attachments as leases. \n\nSee Note 10 &#8212; Leases for additional information. \n\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants) \n\nDeferred federal and state income taxes are recorded on significant temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred in the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense, net or Other, net (interest income) and recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other, net in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants) \n\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Registrants' restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented the following items: \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant Description Exelon Payment of medical, dental, vision, and long-term disability benefits, in addition to the items listed below for the Utility Registrants. ComEd Collateral held from suppliers associated with energy and REC procurement contracts, any over-recovered RPS costs and alternative compliance payments received from RES pursuant to FEJA, and costs for the remediation of an MGP site. PECO Proceeds from the sales of assets that were subject to PECO&#8217;s mortgage indenture. BGE Proceeds from the loan program for the completion of certain energy efficiency measures and collateral held from energy suppliers. \n\nPHI (a) \n\nPayment of merger commitments, collateral held from its energy suppliers associated with procurement contracts, and repayment of Transition Bonds Pepco Payment of merger commitments and collateral held from energy suppliers. DPL Collateral held from energy suppliers. \n\nACE (a) \n\nRepayment of Transition Bonds ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) As of December 31, 2021, the Transition Bonds were fully redeemed. \n\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents not available to satisfy current liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Registrants' noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented ComEd&#8217;s over-recovered RPS costs and alternative compliance payments received from RES pursuant to FEJA and costs for the remediation of an MGP site. \n\nSee Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 22 &#8212; Supplemental Financial Information for additional information. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivables (All Registrants) \n\nThe allowance for credit losses reflects the Registrants&#8217; best estimates of losses on the customers' accounts receivable balances based on historical experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses is developed by applying loss rates for each Utility Registrant, based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors, to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Utility Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are primarily recorded to Operating and maintenance expense on the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or Regulatory assets and liabilities on the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of credit losses on customer accounts receivable. \n\nThe Registrants have certain non-customer receivables in Other deferred debits and other assets which primarily are with governmental agencies and other high-quality counterparties with no history of default. As such, the allowance for credit losses related to these receivables is not material. The Registrants monitor these balances and will record an allowance if there are indicators of a decline in credit quality. See Note 6 &#8212; Accounts Receivable for additional information. \n\nInventories (All Registrants) \n\nInventory is recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory. Fossil fuel and materials and supplies are generally included in inventory when purchased. Fossil fuel is expensed to Purchased power and fuel expense when used or sold. Materials and supplies generally includes transmission and distribution materials and are expensed to Operating and maintenance or capitalized to Property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants) \n\nProperty, plant, and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs and indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities. When appropriate, original cost also includes AFUDC for regulated property at the Utility Registrants. The cost of repairs and maintenance and minor replacements of property is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred. \n\nThird parties reimburse the Utility Registrants for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, plant, and equipment, net. \n\nUpon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation consistent with the composite and group methods of depreciation. Depreciation expense at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. Actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability or recorded to a regulatory asset if in excess of previously collected removal costs. PECO&#8217;s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO&#8217;s regulatory recovery method. \n\nCapitalized Software. Certain costs, such as design, coding, and testing incurred during the application development stage of software projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized within Property, plant, and equipment. Similar costs incurred for cloud-based solutions treated as service arrangements are capitalized within Other Current Assets and Deferred Debits and Other Assets. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements. \n\nAFUDC. AFUDC is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is recorded to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to an allowance that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by regulatory authorities. \n\nSee Note 7 &#8212; Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 8 &#8212; Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant and Note 22 &#8212; Supplemental Financial Information for additional information. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization (All Registrants) \n\nDepreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant, and equipment on a straight-line basis using the group or composite methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for dissimilar assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with each utility's regulatory recovery method. PECO's removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO's regulatory recovery method. The estimated service lives for the Registrants are based on a combination of depreciation studies and historical retirements. See Note 7 &#8212; Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information regarding depreciation. \n\nAmortization of regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded over the recovery or refund period specified in the related legislation or regulatory order or agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost or income would have originally been recorded in the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Amortization of ComEd&#8217;s electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rate regulatory assets and the Utility Registrants' transmission formula rate regulatory assets is recorded to Operating revenues. \n\nAmortization of income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities is generally recorded to Income tax expense. Except for the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed above, amortization is generally recorded to \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\nDepreciation and amortization in the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income when the recovery period is more than one year. \n\nSee Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 22 &#8212; Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding the amortization of the Registrants' regulatory assets. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants estimate and recognize a liability for their legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities even though the timing and/or methods of settlement may be conditional on future events. The Registrants update their AROs either annually or on a rotational basis at least once every three years, based on a risk profile, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. The updates factor in new cost estimates, credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (CARFR) and escalation rates, and the timing of cash flows. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through an increase to regulatory assets. See Note 9 &#8212; Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information. \n\nGuarantees (All Registrants) \n\nIf necessary, the Registrants recognize a liability at the time of issuance of a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations they have undertaken by issuing the guarantee. The liability is reduced or eliminated as the Registrants are released from risk under the guarantee. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the guarantee. See Note 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. \n\nAsset Impairments \n\nLong-Lived Assets (All Registrants). The Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include specific regulatory disallowance, abandonment, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset over its fair value. \n\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, and PHI). Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 12 &#8212; Intangible Assets for additional information. \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants) \n\nDerivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including NPNS. For derivatives that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value each period are initially recorded in AOCI and recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are included as a component of operating, investing, or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction. \n\nFor derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, which are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value each period are recognized in earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability each period. Amounts recognized in earnings are recorded in Electric operating revenues, Purchased power and fuel, or Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. Changes in fair value are also recorded as a regulatory asset or liability when there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs or benefits in accordance with regulatory requirements. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing, or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 1 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies \n\nnature of the hedged item. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. \n\nRetirement Benefits (All Registrants) \n\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for substantially all current employees. \n\nThe plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans are measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors, assumptions, and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and OPEB obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. See Note 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits for additional information. \n\n2. Discontinued Operations (Exelon) \n\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon's Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies (\"the separation\"). Exelon completed the separation on February 1, 2022, through the distribution of 326,663,937 common stock shares of Constellation, the new publicly traded company, to Exelon shareholders. Under the separation plan, Exelon shareholders retained their current shares of Exelon stock and received one share of Constellation common stock for every three shares of Exelon common stock held on January 20, 2022, the record date for the distribution, in a transaction that was tax-free to Exelon and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n\nConstellation was newly formed and incorporated in Pennsylvania on June 15, 2021 for the purposes of separation and holds Generation (including Generation's subsidiaries). \n\nPursuant to the separation: \n\n&#8226; Exelon entered into four term loans consisting of a 364-day term loan for $ 1.15 billion and three 18-month term loans for $ 300 million, $ 300 million and $ 250 million, respectively. Exelon issued these term loans primarily to fund the cash payment to Constellation and for general corporate purposes. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information. \n\n&#8226; Exelon made a cash payment of $ 1.75 billion to Constellation on January 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; Exelon contributed its equity ownership interest in Generation to Constellation. Exelon no longer retains any equity ownership interest in Generation or Constellation. \n\n&#8226; Exelon transferred certain corporate assets and employee-related obligations to Constellation. \n\n&#8226; Exelon received cash from Generation of $ 258 million to settle the intercompany loan on January 31, 2022. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information. \n\nContinuing Involvement \n\nIn order to govern the ongoing relationships between Exelon and Constellation after the separation, and to facilitate an orderly transition, Exelon and Constellation have entered into several agreements, including the following: \n\n&#8226; Separation Agreement &#8211; governs the rights and obligations between Exelon and Constellation regarding certain actions to be taken in connection with the separation, among others, including the allocation of assets and liabilities between Exelon and Constellation. \n\n&#8226; Transition Services Agreement (TSA) &#8211; governs the terms and conditions of the services that Exelon will provide to Constellation and Constellation will provide to Exelon for an expected period of two years, provided that certain services may be longer than the term and services may be extended with approval from both parties. The services include specified accounting, finance, information technology, human resources, employee benefits, and other services that have historically been provided on a centralized basis by BSC. For the period from February 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the amounts Exelon billed \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations \n\nConstellation and Constellation billed Exelon for these services were $ 266 million recorded in Other income, net and $ 43 million recorded in Operating and maintenance expense, respectively. \n\n&#8226; Tax Matters Agreement (TMA) &#8211; governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exelon and Constellation with respect to all tax matters, including tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax returns, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. See Note 13 &#8212; Income Taxes for additional Information. \n\nIn addition, the Utility Registrants will continue to incur expenses from transactions with Constellation after the separation. Prior to the separation, such expenses were primarily recorded as Purchased power from affiliates and an immaterial amount recorded as Operating and maintenance expense from affiliates at the Utility Registrants. After the separation, such expenses are primarily recorded as Purchased power and an immaterial amount recorded as Operating and maintenance expense at the Utility Registrants. \n\n&#8226; ComEd had an ICC-approved RFP contract with Constellation to provide a portion of ComEd&#8217;s electric supply requirements. ComEd also purchased RECs and ZECs from Constellation. \n\n&#8226; PECO received electric supply from Constellation under contracts executed through PECO&#8217;s competitive procurement process. In addition, PECO had a ten-year agreement with Constellation to sell solar AECs. \n\n&#8226; BGE received a portion of its energy requirements from Constellation under its MDPSC-approved market-based SOS and gas commodity programs. \n\n&#8226; Pepco received electric supply from Constellation under contracts executed through Pepco&#8217;s competitive procurement process approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC. \n\n&#8226; DPL received a portion of its energy requirements from Constellation under its MDPSC and DEPSC approved market-based SOS commodity programs. \n\n&#8226; ACE received electric supply from Constellation under contracts executed through ACE&#8217;s competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. \n\nComEd and PECO also have receivables with Constellation for estimated excess funds at the end of decommissioning the Regulatory Agreement Units, such amounts are due back to ComEd and PECO, as applicable, for payment to their respective customers. See Note 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters and Note 23 &#8212; Related Party Transactions for additional information. \n\nDiscontinued Operations \n\nThe separation represented a strategic shift that would have a major effect on Exelon&#8217;s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the separation meets the criteria for discontinued operations. \n\nThe following table presents the results of Constellation that have been reclassified from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations within Exelon&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nThese results are primarily Generation, which is comprised of Exelon&#8217;s Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions reportable segments, and include the impact of transaction costs, certain BSC costs, including any transition costs, that were historically allocated and directly attributable to Generation, transactions between Generation and the Utility Registrants, and tax-related adjustments. Transaction costs include costs for external bankers, accountants, appraisers, lawyers, external counsels and other advisors, among others, who were involved in the negotiation, appraisal, due diligence and regulatory approval of the separation. Transition costs are primarily employee-related costs such as recruitment expenses, costs to establish certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems, professional services fees, and other separation-related costs during the transition to separate Generation. For the purposes of reporting discontinued operations, these results also include transactions between Generation and the Utility Registrants that were historically eliminated within Exelon&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations, as these transactions will be ongoing after the separation. Certain BSC costs that were historically allocated to Generation are presented as part of continuing operations in \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations \n\nExelon&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules. \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating revenues Competitive business revenues $ 1,855 &#160; $ 18,466 &#160; $ 16,399 &#160; Competitive business revenues from affiliates 161 &#160; 1,189 &#160; 1,206 &#160; Total operating revenues 2,016 &#160; 19,655 &#160; 17,605 &#160; Operating expenses Competitive businesses purchased power and fuel 1,138 &#160; 12,163 &#160; 9,585 &#160; Operating and maintenance (a) \n\n371 &#160; 4,174 &#160; 4,794 &#160; Depreciation and amortization 94 &#160; 3,003 &#160; 2,123 &#160; Taxes other than income taxes 44 &#160; 475 &#160; 482 &#160; Total operating expenses 1,647 &#160; 19,815 &#160; 16,984 &#160; Gain on sales of assets and businesses 10 &#160; 201 &#160; 11 &#160; Operating income 379 &#160; 41 &#160; 632 &#160; Other income and (deductions) Interest expense, net ( 20 ) ( 282 ) ( 328 ) Other, net ( 281 ) 795 &#160; 937 &#160; Total other (deductions) and income ( 301 ) 513 &#160; 609 &#160; Income before income taxes 78 &#160; 554 &#160; 1,241 &#160; Income taxes ( 40 ) 332 &#160; 380 &#160; Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates ( 1 ) ( 9 ) ( 6 ) Net income 117 &#160; 213 &#160; 855 &#160; Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 1 &#160; 123 &#160; ( 9 ) Net income from discontinued operations $ 116 &#160; $ 90 &#160; $ 864 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Includes transaction and transition costs related to the separation of $ 52 million and $ 43 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

See discussion of CEJA below for details on the transition away from the electric distribution formula rate. The electric distribution formula rate includes decoupling provisions and, as a result, ComEd's electric distribution formula rate revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer, or number of customers. Under the performance-based formula, ComEd filed annual updates to its electric distribution formula rate on or before May 1 st , with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. ComEd&#8217;s annual electric distribution formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation). \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nComEd&#8217;s 2022 approved revenue requirement reflects an increase of $ 37 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2022 and an increase of $ 9 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2020. The revenue requirement for 2022 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 5.72 % inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.36 %, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points . The reconciliation revenue requirement for 2020 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 5.69 %, inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.29 %, reflecting the monthly yields on 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points less a performance metrics penalty of 7 basis points. \n\nComEd&#8217;s 2023 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $ 144 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2023 and an increase of $ 55 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2021. The revenue requirement for 2023 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 5.94 % inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.85 %, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The reconciliation revenue requirement for 2021 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 5.91 %, inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.78 %, reflecting the monthly yields on 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points less a performance metrics penalty of 7 basis points. This is ComEd's last performance-based electric distribution formula rate update filing under EIMA. See discussion of CEJA below for details on the transition away from the electric distribution formula rate. \n\n(b) The PECO electric and natural gas base rate case proceedings were resolved through settlement agreements, which did not specify an approved ROE. \n\n(c) Reflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for 2021 through 2023. BGE proposed to use certain tax benefits to fully offset the increases in 2021 and 2022 and partially offset the increase in 2023. The MDPSC awarded BGE electric revenue requirement increases of $ 59 million, $ 39 million, and $ 42 million, before offsets, in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, and natural gas revenue requirement increases of $ 53 million, $ 11 million, and $ 10 million, before offsets, in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. However, the MDPSC utilized the tax benefits to fully offset the increases in 2021 and January 2022 such that customer rates remained unchanged. For the remainder of 2022, the MDPSC chose to offset only 25 % of the cumulative 2021 and 2022 electric revenue requirement increases and 50 % of the cumulative gas revenue requirement i ncreases. In 2021, the MDPSC deferred a decision on whether to use certain tax benefits to offset the revenue requirement increases in 2023 and directed BGE to make another proposal at the end of 2022. In September 2022 BGE proposed that tax benefits not be used to offset the 2023 revenue requirement increases. On October 26, 2022, the MDPSC accepted BGE's recommendation to not use tax benefits to offset the 2023 revenue requirement increases . \n\n(d) Reflects a cumulative multi-year plan with 18-months remaining in 2021 through 2022. The DCPSC awarded Pepco electric incremental revenue requirement increases of $ 42 million and $ 67 million, before offsets, for 2021 and 2022, respectively. However, the DCPSC utilized the acceleration of refunds for certain tax benefits along with other rate relief to partially offset the customer rate increases by $ 22 million and $ 40 million for 2021 and 2022, respectively. \n\n(e) Reflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024. The MDPSC awarded Pepco electric incremental revenue requirement increases of $ 21 million, $ 16 million, and $ 15 million, before offsets, for the 12-month periods ending March 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Pepco proposed to utilize certain tax benefits to fully offset the increase through 2023 and partially offset customer rate increases in 2024. However, the MDPSC only utilized the acceleration of refunds for certain tax benefits to fully offset the increases such that customer rates remain unchanged through March 31, 2022. On February 23, 2022, the MDPSC chose to offset 25 % of the cumulative revenue requirement increase through March 31, 2023. Whether certain tax benefits will be used to offset the customer rate increases for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has not been decided, and Pepco cannot predict the outcome. \n\n(f) The approved settlement reflects a 9.60 % ROE, which is solely for the purposes of calculating AFUDC and regulatory asset carrying costs. \n\n(g) Reflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. The MDPSC awarded DPL electric incremental revenue requirement increases of $ 17 million, $ 6 million, and $ 6 million for 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. \n\n(h) Requested and approved increases are before New Jersey sales and use tax. The order allows ACE to retain approximately $ 11 million of certain tax benefits which resulted in a decrease to income tax expense in Exelon's, PHI's, and ACE's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the third quarter of 2021. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nPending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant/Jurisdiction Filing Date Service Requested Revenue Requirement Increase Requested ROE Expected Approval Timing ComEd - Illinois (a) \n\nJanuary 17, 2023 Electric $ 1,472 &#160; 10.50 % to 10.65 % \n\nFourth quarter of 2023 DPL - Delaware (b) \n\nDecember 15, 2022 Electric 60 &#160; 10.50 % Second quarter of 2024 ##TABLE_END __________ \n\n(a) Reflects a four-year cumulative MRP for January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2027 and total requested revenue requirement increases of $ 877 million effective January 1, 2024, $ 175 million effective January 1, 2025, $ 217 million effective January 1, 2026, and $ 203 million effective January 1, 2027, based on forecasted revenue requirements. The revenue requirement will provide for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 7.43 % in 2024, 7.50 % in 2025, 7.62 % in 2026, and 7.70 % in 2027, inclusive of an allowed ROE of 10.50 % in 2024, 10.55 % in 2025, 10.60 % in 2026, and 10.65 % in 2027. The requested revenue requirements are based on capital structures that reflect between 50.58 % and 51.19 % common equity. ComEd&#8217;s MRP also includes a proposed rate phase-in to defer approximately $ 307 million of the $ 877 million year-over-year increase for 2024 revenue from 2024 to 2026. \n\n(b) The rates will go into effect on July 15, 2023, subject to refund. \n\nTransmission Formula Rates \n\nThe Utility Registrants' transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are required to file an annual update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, and PECO is required to file on or before May 31, with the resulting rates effective on June 1 of the same year. The annual update for ComEd is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The update for ComEd also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1 of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year (annual reconciliation). The annual update for PECO is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions, accumulated depreciation, and accumulated deferred income taxes. The annual update for BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions, accumulated depreciation, depreciation and amortization expense, and accumulated deferred income taxes. The update for PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE also reconciles any differences between the actual costs and actual revenues for the calendar year (annual reconciliation). \n\nFor 2022, the following total increases/(decreases) were included in the Utility Registrants' electric transmission formula rate updates: \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant (a) \n\nInitial Revenue Requirement Increase Annual Reconciliation (Decrease) Increase Total Revenue Requirement Increase Allowed Return on Rate Base (b) \n\nAllowed ROE (c) \n\nComEd $ 24 &#160; $ ( 24 ) $ &#8212; &#160; 8.11 &#160; % 11.50 &#160; % PECO 23 &#160; 16 &#160; 39 &#160; 7.30 &#160; % 10.35 &#160; % BGE 25 &#160; ( 4 ) 16 &#160; (d) 7.30 &#160; % 10.50 &#160; % Pepco 16 &#160; 15 &#160; 31 &#160; 7.60 &#160; % 10.50 &#160; % DPL 9 &#160; 2 &#160; 11 &#160; 7.09 &#160; % 10.50 &#160; % ACE 21 &#160; 13 &#160; 34 &#160; 7.18 &#160; % 10.50 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) All rates are effective June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2023, subject to review by interested parties pursuant to review protocols of each Utility Registrants' tariff. \n\n(b) Represents the weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate bases. For ComEd and PECO, the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return on the transmission formula rate base is currently capped at 55 % and 55.75 %, respectively. \n\n(c) The rate of return on common equity for each Utility Registrant includes a 50 -basis-point incentive adder for being a member of a RTO. \n\n(d) The increase in BGE's transmission revenue requirement includes a $ 5 million reduction related to a FERC-approved dedicated facilities charge to recover the costs of providing transmission service to specifically designated load by BGE. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nOther State Regulatory Matters \n\nIllinois Regulatory Matters \n\nCEJA (Exelon and ComEd). On September 15, 2021, the Governor of Illinois signed into law CEJA. CEJA includes, among other features, (1) procurement of CMCs from qualifying nuclear-powered generating facilities, (2) a requirement to file a general rate case or a new four-year MRP no later than January 20, 2023 to establish rates effective after ComEd&#8217;s existing performance-based distribution formula rate sunsets, (3) an extension of and certain adjustments to ComEd&#8217;s energy efficiency MWh savings goals, (4) revisions to the Illinois RPS requirements, including expanded charges for the procurement of RECs from wind and solar generation, (5) a requirement to accelerate amortization of ComEd&#8217;s unprotected excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) that ComEd was previously directed by the ICC to amortize using the average rate assumption method which equates to approximately 39.5 years, and (6) requirements that ComEd and the ICC initiate and conduct various regulatory proceedings on subjects including ethics, spending, grid investments, and performance metrics. Regulatory or legal challenges regarding the validity or implementation of CEJA are possible and Exelon and ComEd cannot reasonably predict the outcome of any such challenges. \n\nComEd Electric Distribution Rates \n\nComEd filed, and received approval for, its last performance-based electric distribution formula rate update filing under EIMA in 2022; those rates are in effect throughout 2023. \n\nOn February 3, 2022, the ICC approved a tariff that establishes the process under which ComEd will reconcile its 2022 and 2023 rate year revenue requirements with actual costs. Those reconciliation amounts will be determined using the same process as were used for prior reconciliations under the performance-based electric distribution formula rate. Using that process, for the rate years 2022 and 2023 ComEd will ultimately collect revenues from customers reflecting each year&#8217;s actual recoverable costs, year-end rate base, and a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base, with the ROE component based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. ComEd will in 2023 file with the ICC the first such petition to reconcile its 2022 actual costs with the approved revenue requirement that was in effect in 2022. The rate year 2023 reconciliation will be filed in 2024. \n\nBeginning in 2024, ComEd will recover from retail customers, subject to certain exceptions, the costs it incurs to provide electric delivery services either through its electric distribution rate or other recovery mechanisms authorized by CEJA. On January 17, 2023, ComEd filed a petition with the ICC seeking approval of a MRP for 2024-2027. The MRP supports a multi-year grid plan (Grid Plan), also filed on January 17, covering planned investments on the electric distribution system within ComEd&#8217;s service area through 2027. Costs incurred during each year of the multi-year plan are subject to ICC review and the plan&#8217;s revenue requirement for each year will be reconciled with the actual costs that the ICC determines are prudently and reasonably incurred for that year. The reconciliation is subject to adjustment for certain costs, including a limitation on recovery of costs that are more than 105 % of certain costs in the previously approved MRP revenue requirement, absent a modification of the rate plan itself. Thus, for example, the rate adjustments necessary to reconcile 2024 revenues to ComEd&#8217;s actual 2024 costs incurred would take effect in January 2026 after the ICC&#8217;s review during 2025. The ICC must issue its decision on both the MRP and Grid Plan by mid-December 2023, for rates to begin with the January 2024 billing cycle. \n\nIn January 2022, ComEd filed a request with the ICC proposing performance metrics that would be used in determining ROE incentives and penalties in the event ComEd filed a MRP in January 2023. On September 27, 2022, the ICC issued a final order approving seven performance metrics that provide symmetrical performance adjustments of 32 total basis points to ComEd&#8217;s rate of return on common equity based on the extent to which ComEd achieves the annual performance goals. On November 10, 2022, the ICC granted ComEd's application for rehearing, in part. Rehearing on those issues must conclude by April 9, 2023. It is unclear if rehearing will result in modifications to the ICC-approved performance and tracking metrics. ComEd will make its initial filing in 2025 to assess performance achieved under the metrics in 2024, and to determine any ROE adjustment, which would take effect in 2026. \n\nCarbon Mitigation Credit \n\nCEJA establishes decarbonization requirements for Illinois as well as programs to support the retention and development of emissions-free sources of electricity. ComEd is required to purchase CMCs from participating \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nnuclear-powered generating facilities between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2027. The price to be paid for each CMC was established through a competitive bidding process that included consumer-protection measures that capped the maximum acceptable bid amount and a formula that reduces CMC prices by an energy price index, the base residual auction capacity price in the ComEd zone of PJM, and the monetized value of any federal tax credit or other subsidy if applicable. The consumer protection measures contained in CEJA will result in net payments to ComEd ratepayers if the energy index, the capacity price and applicable federal tax credits or subsidy exceed the CMC contract price. ComEd began issuing credits to its retail customers under its new CMC rider in the June 2022 billing period and recorded a regulatory asset of $ 843 million as of December 31, 2022 for the difference between customer credits issued and the credit to be received from the participating nuclear-powered generating facilities. \n\nUnder CEJA, the costs of procuring CMCs will be recovered through a new rider, the Rider Carbon-Free Resource Adjustment (Rider CFRA). The Rider CFRA provides for an annual reconciliation and true-up to actual costs incurred or credits received by ComEd to purchase CMCs, with any difference to be credited to or collected from ComEd&#8217;s retail customers in subsequent periods. The difference between the net payments to (or receivables from) ComEd ratepayers and the credits received by ComEd to purchase CMCs is recorded to Purchased Power expense with an offset to the regulatory asset (or regulatory liability). On December 21, 2022, ComEd filed a supplemental statement to the Rider CFRA proposing that the company recover costs or provide credits faster than the tariff allows, implement monthly reconciliations, and allow the Company to adjust Rider CFRA rates based not only on anticipated differences but also past payments or credits. The ICC approved the proposal on January 19, 2023. If the revised CFRA tariff were in effect as of the balance sheet date, the current portion of the CMC regulatory asset balance would have increased by $ 117 million as of December 31, 2022, with an offsetting reduction in the noncurrent regulatory asset balance. \n\nExcess Deferred Income Taxes \n\nThe ICC initiated a docket to accelerate and fully credit to customers TCJA unprotected property-related EDIT no later than December 31, 2025. On July 7, 2022, the ICC issued a final order on the schedule for the acceleration of EDIT amortization, adopting the proposal as submitted by several parties, including ComEd, ICC Staff, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Citizens Utility Board. EDIT amortization will be credited to customers through a new rider from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. \n\nBeneficial Electrification Plan \n\nOn July 1, 2022, ComEd filed a proposed plan to promote beneficial electrification efforts in its Northern Illinois service area with the ICC as required by CEJA. ComEd's plan is designed to meaningfully reduce barriers to beneficial electrification, including those related to electric vehicles (EVs), such as upfront technology adoption costs, charging costs, and charging availability; promote equity and environmental justice; reduce carbon emissions and surface-level pollutants; and support customer education and awareness of electrification options. As proposed, ComEd could expend approximately $ 300 million in total over the three-year period 2023 through 2025. The beneficial electrification plan requests recovery of all those costs through a rider mechanism, under which certain of the costs would be amortized over ten years with a return on the unrecovered balance. On November 10, 2022, in responses to a Staff motion, the ICC approved an interim order dismissing from ComEd&#8217;s Beneficial Electrification Plan certain rebates (rebates to support residential customers&#8217; purchase of EVs; and rebates to ComEd&#8217;s commercial and industrial customers to support the installation of EV chargers). However, the ICC found that building electrification measures were properly within the scope of beneficial electrification, in line with ComEd&#8217;s proposal. The ICC also adopted ComEd&#8217;s position regarding the rate impact of spending associated with EV related infrastructure. On November 21, 2022, ComEd filed an application for rehearing of the interim order, which the ICC denied. On December 9, 2022, the Office of the Illinois Attorney General (AG) also sought rehearing. On December 15, 2022, ComEd filed an appeal of the ICC&#8217;s interim order and the denial of rehearing with the Illinois Appellate Court. That appeal has been stayed pending the resolution of the balance of the case. Also on December 15, 2022, the ICC denied the AG&#8217;s application for rehearing and the AG subsequently filed an appeal. The testimony and hearing phase of this proceeding has concluded and the parties are now drafting legal briefs on the contested issues. By law the ICC must issue its decision by the end of March, therefore, a final order is expected to be issued by the ICC no later than the first quarter of 2023. At this time, ComEd cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nEnergy Efficiency \n\nCEJA extends ComEd&#8217;s current cumulative annual energy efficiency MWh savings goals through 2040, adds expanded electrification measures to those goals, increases low-income commitments and adds a new performance adjustment to the energy efficiency formula rate. ComEd expects its annual spend to increase in 2023 through 2040 to achieve these energy efficiency MWh savings goals, which will be deferred as a separate regulatory asset that will be recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd). FEJA allows ComEd to defer energy efficiency costs (except for any voltage optimization costs which are recovered through the electric distribution formula rate) as a separate regulatory asset that is recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures. ComEd earns a return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset at a rate equal to its weighted average cost of capital, which is based on a year-end capital structure and calculated using the same methodology applicable to ComEd&#8217;s electric distribution formula rate. Beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2030, the ROE that ComEd earns on its energy efficiency regulatory asset is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if ComEd&#8217;s cumulative persisting annual MWh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its annual incremental savings goal. ComEd is required to file an update to its energy efficiency formula rate on or before June 1 st each year, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. The annual update is based on projected current year energy efficiency costs, PJM capacity revenues, and the projected year-end regulatory asset balance less any related deferred income taxes (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation). The approved energy efficiency formula rate also provides for revenue decoupling provisions similar to those in ComEd&#8217;s electric distribution formula rate. \n\nDuring 2022, the ICC approved the following total increases in ComEd's requested energy efficiency revenue requirement: \n\n##TABLE_START Filing Date Requested Revenue Requirement Increase Approved Revenue Requirement Increase (a) \n\nApproved ROE Approval Date Rate Effective Date May 25, 2022 $ 50 &#160; $ 50 &#160; 7.85 &#160; % October 27, 2022 January 1, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\n_________ \n\n(a) ComEd&#8217;s 2023 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $ 66 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2023 and a decrease of $ 16 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2021. The revenue requirement for 2023 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of 5.94 % inclusive of an allowed ROE of 7.85 %, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The revenue requirement for the 2021 reconciliation year provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of 5.52 % inclusive of an allowed ROE of 6.99 %, which includes a downward performance adjustment that decreased the ROE. The performance adjustment can either increase or decrease the ROE based upon the achievement of energy efficiency savings goals. See table below for ComEd's regulatory assets associated with its energy efficiency formula rate. \n\nMaryland Regulatory Matters \n\nMaryland Revenue Decoupling (Exelon, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL). In 1998, the MDPSC approved natural gas monthly rate adjustments for BGE and in 2007, the MDPSC approved electric monthly rate adjustments for BGE and BSAs for Pepco and DPL, all of which are decoupling mechanisms. As a result of the decoupling mechanisms, certain Operating revenues from electric and natural gas distribution at BGE and Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco Maryland (see also District of Columbia Revenue Decoupling below for Pepco District of Columbia) and DPL are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer. For BGE, Pepco, and DPL, the decoupling mechanism eliminates the impacts of abnormal weather or customer usage by recognizing revenues based on an authorized distribution amount per customer by customer class. Operating revenues from electric and natural gas distribution at BGE and Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco Maryland and DPL are, however, impacted by changes in the number of customers. \n\nMaryland Order Directing the Distribution of Energy Assistance Funds (Exelon, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL). On June 15, 2021, the MDPSC issued an order authorizing the disbursal of funds to utilities in accordance with Maryland COVID-19 relief legislation. Under this order, BGE, Pepco, and DPL received funds of $ 50 million, \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\n$ 12 million, and $ 8 million, respectively, in July 2021. The funds have been used to reduce or eliminate certain qualifying past-due residential customer receivables. \n\nDistrict of Columbia Regulatory Matters \n\nDistrict of Columbia Revenue Decoupling (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco). In 2009, the DCPSC approved a BSA, which is a decoupling mechanism. As a result of the decoupling mechanism, Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco District of Columbia (see also Maryland Revenue Decoupling above for Pepco Maryland) are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer. The decoupling mechanism eliminates the impacts of abnormal weather or customer usage by recognizing revenues based on an authorized distribution amount per customer by customer class. Operating revenues from electric distribution at Pepco District of Columbia are, however, impacted by changes in the number of customers. \n\nNew Jersey Regulatory Matters \n\nConservation Incentive Program (CIP) (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On September 25, 2020, ACE filed an application with the NJBPU as was required seeking approval to implement a portfolio of energy efficiency programs pursuant to New Jersey&#8217;s clean energy legislation. The filing included a request to implement a CIP that would eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on distribution revenues for most customers. The CIP compares current distribution revenues by customer class to approved target revenues established in ACE&#8217;s most recent distribution base rate case. The CIP is calculated annually and recovery is subject to certain conditions, including an earnings test and ceilings on customer rate increases. \n\nOn April 27, 2021, the NJBPU approved the settlement filed by ACE and the third parties to the proceeding. The approved settlement addresses all material aspects of ACE&#8217;s filing, including ACE&#8217;s ability to implement the CIP prospectively effective July 1, 2021. As a result of this decoupling mechanism, operating revenues will no longer be impacted by abnormal weather or usage for most customers. Starting in third quarter of 2021, ACE will record alternative revenue program revenues for its best estimate of the distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in CIP rates that it believes are probable of approval by the NJBPU in accordance with this mechanism. \n\nTermination of Energy Procurement Provisions of PPAs (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On December 22, 2021, ACE filed with the NJBPU a petition to terminate the provisions in the PPAs to purchase electricity from two coal-powered generation facilities located in the state of New Jersey. The petition was approved by the NJBPU on March 23, 2022. Upon closing of the transaction on March 31, 2022, ACE recognized a liability of $ 203 million for the contract termination fee, which is to be paid by the end of 2024, and recognized a corresponding regulatory asset of $ 203 million. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the $ 137 million liability for the contract termination fee consists of $ 87 million and $ 50 million included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities, respectively, in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current and noncurrent liabilities are included in PPA termination obligation and Other deferred credits and other liabilities, respectively, in PHI's and ACE's Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, ACE has paid $ 66 million of the liability, which is recorded in Changes in Other assets and liabilities in Exelon's, PHI's, and ACE's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nACE Infrastructure Investment Program Filings (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On February 28, 2018, ACE filed with the NJBPU the company&#8217;s IIP proposing to seek recovery of a series of investments through a new rider mechanism, totaling $ 338 million, between 2019-2022 to provide safe and reliable service for its customers. The IIP will allow for more timely recovery of investments made to modernize and enhance ACE&#8217;s electric system. On April 15, 2019, ACE entered into a settlement agreement with other parties, which allows for a recovery totaling $ 96 million of reliability related capital investments from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2023. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the settlement agreement. \n\nOn October 31, 2022, ACE filed with the NJBPU the company&#8217;s second IIP, proposing to seek recovery through a new component of ACE&#8217;s rider mechanism, totaling $ 379 million, over the four-year period of July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2027. The new IIP will allow ACE to invest in projects that are designed to enhance the reliability, resiliency, and safety of the service ACE provides to its customers. ACE has requested that the NJBPU render a \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\ndecision in this matter during the first half of 2023 but cannot predict if the NJBPU will approve the application as filed. \n\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure Filing (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On August 26, 2020, ACE filed an application with the NJBPU as was required seeking approval to deploy a smart energy network in alignment with New Jersey&#8217;s Energy Master Plan and Clean Energy Act. The proposal consisted of estimated costs totaling $ 220 million with deployment taking place over a 3-year implementation period from approximately 2021 to 2024 that involves the installation of an integrated system of smart meters for all customers accompanied by the requisite communications facilities and data management systems. \n\nOn July 14, 2021, the NJBPU approved the settlement filed by ACE and the third parties to the proceeding. The approved settlement addresses all material aspects of ACE's smart energy network deployment plan, including cost recovery of the investment costs, incremental O&#38;M expenses, and the unrecovered balance of existing infrastructure through future distribution rates. \n\nNew Jersey Clean Energy Legislation (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On May 23, 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established and modified New Jersey&#8217;s clean energy and energy efficiency programs and solar and RPS. On the same day, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that provides compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements. Under the legislation, the NJBPU will issue ZECs to the qualifying nuclear power plants and the electric distribution utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, will be required to purchase those ZECs. ACE began collecting from retail distribution customers, through a non-bypassable charge, all costs associated with the procurement of the ZECs effective April 18, 2019. \n\nOther Federal Regulatory Matters \n\nTransmission-Related Income Tax Regulatory Assets (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE). On December 13, 2016 (and as amended on March 13, 2017), BGE filed with FERC to begin recovering certain existing and future transmission-related income tax regulatory assets through its transmission formula rate. BGE&#8217;s existing regulatory assets included (1) amounts that, if BGE&#8217;s transmission formula rate provided for recovery, would have been previously amortized and (2) amounts that would be amortized and recovered prospectively. On November 16, 2017, FERC issued an order rejecting BGE&#8217;s proposed revisions to its transmission formula rate to recover these transmission-related income tax regulatory assets. In the fourth quarter of 2017, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE fully impaired their associated transmission-related income tax regulatory assets for the portion of the income tax regulatory assets that would have been previously amortized. \n\nOn February 23, 2018 (as amended on July 9, 2018), ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each filed with FERC to revise their transmission formula rate mechanisms to permit recovery of transmission-related income tax regulatory assets, including those amounts that would have been previously amortized and recovered through rates had the transmission formula rate provided for such recovery. \n\nOn September 7, 2018, FERC issued orders rejecting (1) BGE&#8217;s rehearing request of FERC's November 16, 2017 order and (2) the February 23, 2018 (as amended on July 9, 2018) filing by ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE for similar recovery. \n\nOn November 2, 2018, BGE filed an appeal of FERC's September 7, 2018 order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court denied BGE&#8217;s November 2, 2018 appeal. \n\nOn October 1, 2018, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE submitted filings to recover ongoing non-TCJA amortization amounts and credit TCJA transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities to customers for the prospective period starting on October 1, 2018. On April 26, 2019, FERC issued an order accepting ComEd's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's October 1, 2018 filings, effective October 1, 2018, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. On April 24, 2020, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, ACE, and other parties filed a settlement agreement with FERC, which FERC approved on September 24, 2020. The settlement agreement provides for the recovery of ongoing transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and establishes the amount and amortization period for excess deferred income taxes resulting from TCJA. The settlement resulted in a reduction to Operating revenues and an offsetting reduction to Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2020. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nFERC Audit (Exelon and ComEd). The Registrants are subject to periodic audits and investigations by FERC. FERC&#8217;s Division of Audits and Accounting initiated a nonpublic audit of ComEd in May 2021 evaluating ComEd&#8217;s compliance with (1) approved terms, rates and conditions of its transmission formula rate mechanism; (2) accounting requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts; (3) reporting requirements of the FERC Form 1; and (4) the requirements for record retention. The audit covered the period from January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2022. On January 17, 2023, ComEd was provided with information on a series of potential findings, including concerning ComEd's methodology regarding the allocation of certain overhead costs to capital under FERC regulations. The final outcome and resolution of the findings or of the audit itself cannot be predicted and the results, while not reasonably estimable at this time, could be material to the Exelon and ComEd financial statements. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities \n\nRegulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. \n\nThe following tables provide information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of the Registrants as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Regulatory assets Pension and OPEB $ 1,867 &#160;

Depreciable life of the related assets Yes ##TABLE_END\n\nDecommissioning the Regulatory Agreement Units \n\nThe regulatory agreements with the ICC and PAPUC dictate obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis and the former PECO units in total. \n\nFor the former PECO units, given the symmetric settlement provisions that allow for continued recovery of decommissioning costs from PECO customers in the event of a shortfall and the obligation for Constellation to ultimately return excess funds to PECO customers (on an aggregate basis for all seven units), decommissioning-related activities prior to separation on February 1, 2022 were generally offset in Exelon&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income with an offsetting adjustment to the regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets and an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from or payable to Generation at PECO. Following the separation, decommissioning-related activities result in an adjustment to the Receivable related to Regulatory Agreement Units and an equal adjustment to the regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets at PECO. \n\nFor the former ComEd units, given no further recovery from ComEd customers is permitted and Constellation retains an obligation to ultimately return excess funds to ComEd customers (on a unit-by-unit basis), to the extent excess funds are expected for each unit, decommissioning-related activities prior to separation on February 1, 2022 were offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income with an offsetting adjustment to regulatory liabilities and noncurrent affiliate receivable from Generation at ComEd. Following the separation, decommissioning-related activities result in an adjustment to the Receivable related to Regulatory Agreement Units and an equal adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd. However, given the asymmetric settlement provision that does not allow for continued recovery from ComEd customers in the event of a shortfall, recognition of a regulatory asset at ComEd is not permissible. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 3 &#8212; Regulatory Matters \n\nCapitalized Ratemaking Amounts Not Recognized \n\nThe following table presents authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes related to earnings on shareholders&#8217; investment that are not recognized for financial reporting purposes in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The earnings on energy efficiency are on Pepco District of Columbia and DPL Delaware programs only. \n\n4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and gas tariff sales, distribution, and transmission services. The performance obligations, revenue recognition, and payment terms associated with these sources of revenue are further discussed in the table below. There are no significant financing components for these sources of revenue and no variable consideration. \n\nUnless otherwise noted, for each of the significant revenue categories and related performance obligations described below, the Registrants have the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value transferred to the customer for the performance completed to date. Therefore, the Registrants generally recognize revenue in the amount for which they have the right to invoice the customer. As a result, there are generally no significant judgments used in determining or allocating the transaction price. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 4 &#8212; Revenue from Contracts with Customers \n\n##TABLE_START Revenue Source Description Performance Obligation Timing of Revenue Recognition Payment Terms Regulated Electric and Gas Tariff Sales Sales of electricity and electricity distribution services (the Utility Registrants) and natural gas and gas distribution services (PECO, BGE, and DPL) to residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental customers through regulated tariff rates approved by state regulatory commissions.

While the Utility Registrants are required under state legislation to bill their customers for the supply and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas, they recognize revenue related only to the distribution services when customers purchase their electricity or natural gas from competitive suppliers. \n\n(b) Passage of time is used for NITS and access to the wholesale grid and MWhs of energy transported over the wholesale grid is used for scheduling, system control and dispatch services. \n\nThe Utility Registrants do not incur any material costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers. \n\nContract Liabilities \n\nThe Registrants record contract liabilities when consideration is received or due prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. The Registrants record contract liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nOn July 1, 2020, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each entered into a collaborative arrangement with an unrelated owner and manager of communication infrastructure (the Buyer). Under this arrangement, Pepco, DPL, and ACE sold a 60% undivided interest in their respective portfolios of transmission tower attachment agreements with telecommunications companies to the Buyer, in addition to transitioning management of the day-to-day operations of the jointly-owned agreements to the Buyer for 35 years, while retaining the safe and reliable operation of its utility assets. In return, Pepco, DPL, and ACE will provide the Buyer limited access on the portion of the towers where the equipment resides for the purposes of managing the agreements for the benefit of Pepco, DPL, ACE, and the Buyer. In addition, for an initial period of three years and two, two-year extensions that are subject to certain conditions, the Buyer has the exclusive right to enter into new agreements with telecommunications companies and to receive a 30% undivided interest in those new agreements. PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE received cash and recorded contract liabilities as of July 1, 2020. The revenue attributable to this arrangement will be recognized as operating revenue over the 35 years under the collaborative arrangement. \n\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the contract liabilities reflected in Exelon's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE'S Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, ComEd's, PECO's, and BGE's contract liabilities were not material. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 4 &#8212; Revenue from Contracts with Customers \n\n##TABLE_START Exelon (a) \n\nPHI (a) \n\nPepco (a) \n\nDPL (a) \n\nACE (a) \n\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 118 &#160; $ 118 &#160; $ 94 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 12 &#160; Revenues recognized ( 9 ) ( 9 ) ( 7 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 109 &#160; 109 &#160; 87 &#160; 11 &#160; 11 &#160; Revenues recognized ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 101 &#160; $ 101 &#160; $ 81 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 10 &#160; ##TABLE_END __________ \n\n(a) Revenues recognized in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were included in the contract liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations \n\nThe following table shows the amounts of future revenues expected to be recorded in each year for performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31, 2022. This disclosure only includes contracts for which the total consideration is fixed and determinable at contract inception. The average contract term varies by customer type and commodity but ranges from one month to several years. \n\nThis disclosure excludes the Utility Registrants' gas and electric tariff sales contracts and transmission revenue contracts as they generally have an original expected duration of one year or less and, therefore, do not contain any future, unsatisfied performance obligations to be included in this disclosure. \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 and thereafter Total Exelon $ 8 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 77 &#160; $ 101 &#160; PHI 8 &#160; 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 77 &#160; 101 &#160; Pepco 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 60 &#160; 81 &#160; DPL 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; 10 &#160; ACE 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; 10 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue Disaggregation \n\nThe Registrants disaggregate revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 5 &#8212; Segment Information for the presentation of the Registrant's revenue disaggregation. \n\n5. Segment Information (All Registrants) \n\nOperating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on information used by the CODMs in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants. \n\nExelon has six reportable segments, which include ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI's three reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE based on net income. \n\nThe separation of Constellation Energy Corporation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Furthermore, the reportable segment information related to the discontinued operations has been excluded from the tables presented below. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations for additional information. \n\nAn analysis and reconciliation of the Registrants' reportable segment information to the respective information in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows: \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 5 &#8212; Segment Information \n\n##TABLE_START ComEd PECO BGE PHI Other (a) \n\nIntersegment Eliminations Exelon \n\nOperating revenues (b) : \n\n2022 Electric revenues $ 5,761 &#160; $ 3,165 &#160; $ 2,871 &#160; $ 5,317 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 31 ) $ 17,083 &#160; Natural gas revenues &#8212; &#160; 738 &#160; 1,024 &#160; 238 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 5 ) 1,995 &#160; Shared service and other revenues &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; 1,823 &#160; ( 1,833 ) &#8212; &#160; Total operating revenues $ 5,761 &#160; $ 3,903 &#160; $ 3,895 &#160; $ 5,565 &#160; $ 1,823 &#160; $ ( 1,869 ) $ 19,078 &#160; 2021 Electric revenues $ 6,406 &#160; $ 2,659 &#160; $ 2,505 &#160; $ 4,860 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 35 ) $ 16,395 &#160; Natural gas revenues &#8212; &#160; 539 &#160; 836 &#160; 168 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,543 &#160; Shared service and other revenues &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; 2,213 &#160; ( 2,226 ) &#8212; &#160; Total operating revenues $ 6,406 &#160; $ 3,198 &#160; $ 3,341 &#160; $ 5,041 &#160; $ 2,213 &#160; $ ( 2,261 ) $ 17,938 &#160; 2020 Electric revenues $ 5,904 &#160; $ 2,543 &#160; $ 2,336 &#160; $ 4,485 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 44 ) $ 15,224 &#160; Natural gas revenues &#8212; &#160; 515 &#160; 762 &#160; 162 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,439 &#160; Shared service and other revenues &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 16 &#160; 2,035 &#160; ( 2,051 ) &#8212; &#160; Total operating revenues $ 5,904 &#160; $ 3,058 &#160; $ 3,098 &#160; $ 4,663 &#160; $ 2,035 &#160; $ ( 2,095 ) $ 16,663 &#160; \n\nIntersegment revenues (c) : \n\n2022 $ 16 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 1,823 &#160; $ ( 1,865 ) $ 6 &#160; 2021 41 &#160; 21 &#160; 31 &#160; 13 &#160; 2,203 &#160; ( 2,252 ) 57 &#160; 2020 37 &#160; 9 &#160; 20 &#160; 17 &#160; 2,024 &#160; ( 2,084 ) 23 &#160; Depreciation and amortization: 2022 $ 1,323 &#160; $ 373 &#160; $ 630 &#160; $ 938 &#160; $ 61 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,325 &#160; 2021 1,205 &#160; 348 &#160; 591 &#160; 821 &#160; 67 &#160; 1 &#160; 3,033 &#160; 2020 1,133 &#160; 347 &#160; 550 &#160; 782 &#160; 79 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,891 &#160; Operating expenses: 2022 $ 4,218 &#160; $ 3,102 &#160; $ 3,376 &#160; $ 4,734 &#160; $ 2,093 &#160; $ ( 1,762 ) $ 15,761 &#160; 2021 5,151 &#160; 2,547 &#160; 2,860 &#160; 4,240 &#160; 2,045 &#160; ( 1,587 ) 15,256 &#160; 2020 4,950 &#160; 2,512 &#160; 2,598 &#160; 4,045 &#160; 1,882 &#160; ( 1,502 ) 14,485 &#160; Interest expense, net: 2022 $ 414 &#160; $ 177 &#160; $ 152 &#160; $ 292 &#160; $ 415 &#160; $ ( 3 ) $ 1,447 &#160; 2021 389 &#160; 161 &#160; 138 &#160; 267 &#160; 335 &#160; ( 1 ) 1,289 &#160; 2020 382 &#160; 147 &#160; 133 &#160; 268 &#160; 380 &#160; ( 3 ) 1,307 &#160; Income taxes: 2022 $ 264 &#160; $ 79 &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 11 ) $ 349 &#160; 2021 172 &#160; 12 &#160; ( 35 ) 42 &#160; 8 &#160; ( 161 ) 38 &#160; 2020 177 &#160; ( 30 ) 41 &#160; ( 77 ) 35 &#160; ( 153 ) ( 7 ) Net income (loss) from continuing operations: 2022 $ 917 &#160; $ 576 &#160; $ 380 &#160; $ 608 &#160; $ ( 393 ) $ ( 34 ) $ 2,054 &#160; 2021 742 &#160; 504 &#160; 408 &#160; 561 &#160; ( 156 ) ( 443 ) 1,616 &#160; 2020 438 &#160; 447 &#160; 349 &#160; 495 &#160; ( 184 ) ( 446 ) 1,099 &#160; Capital expenditures: 2022 $ 2,506 &#160; $ 1,349 &#160; $ 1,262 &#160; $ 1,709 &#160; $ 95 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6,921 &#160; 2021 2,387 &#160; 1,240 &#160; 1,226 &#160; 1,720 &#160; 67 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,640 &#160; 2020 2,217 &#160; 1,147 &#160; 1,247 &#160; 1,604 &#160; 74 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,289 &#160; Total assets: 2022 $ 39,661 &#160; $ 14,502 &#160; $ 13,350 &#160; $ 26,082 &#160; $ 6,014 &#160; $ ( 4,260 ) $ 95,349 &#160; 2021 36,470 &#160; 13,824 &#160; 12,324 &#160; 24,744 &#160; 7,626 &#160; ( 8,319 ) 86,669 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 5 &#8212; Segment Information \n\n__________ \n\n(a) Other primarily includes Exelon&#8217;s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities. \n\n(b) Includes gross utility tax receipts from customers.

Asset Impairments (Exelon and BGE) \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, a review of the impacts of COVID-19 on office use resulted in plans to cease the renovation and dispose of an office building at BGE before the asset was placed into service. BGE determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and that its fair value was less than carrying value. As a result, in 2022, a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 48 million was recorded in Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon&#8217;s and BGE&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The fair value used in the analysis was based on an estimate of an expected sales price. However, the office building did not meet all of the criteria for classification as held for sale as of December 31, 2022, and therefore continues to be reported within Property, plant and equipment in Exelon&#8217;s and BGE&#8217;s Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. \n\n12. Intangible Assets \n\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE) \n\nThe following table presents the gross amount, accumulated impairment loss, and carrying amount of goodwill at Exelon, ComEd, and PHI as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were no additions or impairments during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Gross Amount Accumulated Impairment Loss Carrying Amount Exelon $ 8,613 &#160; $ 1,983 &#160; $ 6,630 &#160; \n\nComEd (a) \n\n4,608 &#160; 1,983 &#160; 2,625 &#160; \n\nPHI (b) \n\n4,005 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,005 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Reflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom merger (predecessor parent company of ComEd). \n\n(b) Reflects goodwill recorded in 2016 from the PHI merger. \n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of ComEd's and PHI's reporting units below their carrying amounts. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is assessed for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment. PHI's operating segments are Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 5 &#8212; Segment Information for additional information. There is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, the ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE operating segments are also considered reporting units for goodwill impairment assessment purposes. Exelon's and ComEd's $ 2.6 billion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit, while Exelon's and PHI's $ 4.0 billion of goodwill has been assigned to the Pepco, DPL, and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $ 2.1 billion, $ 1.4 billion, and $ 0.5 billion, respectively. \n\nEntities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity recognizes an impairment charge, which is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment assessment requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 12 &#8212; Intangible Assets \n\nperformance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's businesses, and the fair value of debt. \n\n2022 and 2021 Goodwill Impairment Assessment. ComEd and PHI qualitatively determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of their reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not perform quantitative assessments as of November 1, 2022 and 2021. The last quantitative assessments performed were as of November 1, 2016 for ComEd and November 1, 2018 for PHI. \n\nWhile the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair values are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon's, ComEd's, and PHI&#8217;s goodwill, which could be material. \n\nOther Intangible Assets and Liabilities (Exelon and PHI) \n\nExelon&#8217;s other intangible assets, included in Other current assets and Other deferred debits and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Exelon's and PHI's other intangible liabilities, included in current and noncurrent Unamortized energy contract liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The intangible assets and liabilities shown below are amortized on a straight-line basis, except for unamortized energy contracts which are amortized in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Exelon Unamortized Energy Contracts $ ( 1,515 ) $ 1,470 &#160; $ ( 45 ) $ ( 1,515 ) $ 1,280 &#160; $ ( 235 ) Software License 81 &#160; ( 61 ) 20 &#160; 81 &#160; ( 53 ) 28 &#160; Exelon Total $ ( 1,434 ) $ 1,409 &#160; $ ( 25 ) $ ( 1,434 ) $ 1,227 &#160; $ ( 207 ) PHI Unamortized Energy Contracts $ ( 1,515 ) $ 1,470 &#160; $ ( 45 ) $ ( 1,515 ) $ 1,280 &#160; $ ( 235 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table summarizes the amortization expense related to intangible assets and liabilities for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Exelon (a) \n\nPHI (a) \n\n2022 (b) \n\n$ ( 182 ) $ ( 190 ) 2021 ( 83 ) ( 92 ) 2020 ( 98 ) ( 115 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) For PHI unamortized energy contracts, the amortization of the fair value adjustment amounts and the corresponding offsetting regulatory asset amounts are amortized through Purchased power and fuel expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income resulting in no effect to net income. \n\n(b) On March 23, 2022, the NJBPU approved a petition by ACE to terminate the provisions in its PPAs.

For BGE, the income tax benefit is primarily due to the Maryland multi-year plan which resulted in the acceleration of certain income tax benefits. For Pepco, the lower effective tax rate is primarily related to the acceleration of certain income tax benefits due to distribution and transmission rate case settlements. For DPL, the higher effective tax rate is primarily related to a state income tax expense, net of federal income tax benefit, due to the recognition of a valuation allowance of approximately $ 31 million against a deferred tax asset associated with Delaware net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a change in Delaware tax law. For ACE, the income tax benefit is primarily due to a distribution rate case settlement which allows ACE to retain certain tax benefits. \n\n(g) For ComEd, the higher effective tax rate is primarily related to the nondeductible DPA payments. For PECO, the negative effective tax rate is primarily related to an increase in plant basis differences attributable to tax repair deductions related to an increase in storms and qualifying projects in 2021. \n\n(h) For BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, the income tax benefit is primarily attributable to accelerated amortization of transmission related deferred income tax regulatory liabilities as a result of regulatory settlements.

The TMA governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between Exelon and Constellation after the separation with respect to tax liabilities, refunds and attributes for open tax years that Constellation was part of Exelon&#8217;s consolidated group for U.S. federal, state, and local tax purposes. \n\nIndemnification for Taxes. As a former subsidiary of Exelon, Constellation has joint and several liability with Exelon to the IRS and certain state jurisdictions relating to the taxable periods prior to the separation. The TMA specifies that Constellation is liable for their share of taxes required to be paid by Exelon with respect to taxable periods prior to the separation to the extent Constellation would have been responsible for such taxes under the existing Exelon tax sharing agreement. As a result, as of March 31, 2022, Exelon recorded a receivable of $ 55 million in Current other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Constellation&#8217;s share of taxes for periods \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 13 &#8212; Income Taxes \n\nprior to the separation. As of December 31, 2022, Exelon recorded a payable of $ 18 million in Current other liabilities that is due to Constellation. \n\nTax Refunds. The TMA specifies that Constellation is entitled to their share of any future tax refunds claimed by Exelon with respect to taxable periods prior to the separation to the extent that Constellation would have received such tax refunds under the existing Exelon tax sharing agreement. \n\nTax Attributes . At the date of separation certain tax attributes, primarily pre-closing tax credit carryforwards, that were generated by Constellation were required by law to be allocated to Exelon. The TMA also provides that Exelon will reimburse Constellation when those allocated tax attribute carryforwards are utilized. As of March 31, 2022, Exelon recorded a payable of $ 11 million and $ 484 million in Current other liabilities and Noncurrent other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for tax credit carryforwards that are expected to be utilized and reimbursed to Constellation. As of December 31, 2022, the current and noncurrent payable amounts are $ 169 million and $ 362 million, respectively. \n\nLong-Term Marginal State Income Tax Rate (All Registrants) \n\nQuarterly, Exelon reviews and updates its marginal state income tax rates for material changes in state tax laws and state apportionment. The Registrants remeasure their existing deferred income tax balances to reflect the changes in marginal rates, which results in either an increase or a decrease to their net deferred income tax liability balances. Utility Registrants record corresponding regulatory liabilities or assets to the extent such amounts are probable of settlement or recovery through customer rates and an adjustment to income tax expense for all other amounts. In the first quarter of 2022, Exelon updated its marginal state income tax rates for changes in state apportionment due to the separation, which resulted in an increase of $ 67 million to the deferred tax liability at Exelon, and a corresponding adjustment to income tax expense, net of federal taxes. The impacts to ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Exelon Increase to Deferred Income Tax Liability and Income Tax Expense, Net of Federal Taxes $ 67 &#160; December 31, 2021 Increase to Deferred Income Tax Liability and Income Tax Expense, Net of Federal Taxes $ 27 &#160; December 31, 2020 Increase to Deferred Income Tax Liability and Income Tax Expense, Net of Federal Taxes $ 66 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nPennsylvania Corporate Income Tax Rate Change (Exelon and PECO) \n\nOn July 8, 2022, Pennsylvania enacted House Bill 1342, which will permanently reduce the corporate income tax rate from 9.99 % to 4.99 %. The tax rate will be reduced to 8.99 % for the 2023 tax year. Starting with the 2024 tax year, the rate is reduced by 0.50 % annually until it reaches 4.99 % in 2031. As a result of the rate change, in the third quarter of 2022, Exelon and PECO recorded a one-time decrease to deferred income taxes of $ 390 million with a corresponding decrease to the deferred income taxes regulatory asset of $ 428 million for the amounts that are expected to be settled through future customer rates and an increase to income tax expense of $ 38 million (net of federal taxes). The tax rate decrease is not expected to have a material ongoing impact to Exelon&#8217;s and PECO&#8217;s financial statements. PECO did not update its marginal state income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\nAllocation of Tax Benefits (All Registrants) \n\nThe Utility Registrants are party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net federal and state benefits attributable to Exelon are reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution from Exelon to the party receiving the benefit. \n\nThe following table presents the allocation of tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 13 &#8212; Income Taxes \n\n##TABLE_START ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE \n\nDecember 31, 2022 (a) \n\n$ 1 &#160; $ 47 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 23 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 2 &#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2021 (b) \n\n1 &#160; 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2020 (c) \n\n14 &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; 8 &#160; 6 &#160; 1 &#160; ##TABLE_END __________ \n\n(a) BGE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss. \n\n(b) BGE, DPL, and ACE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss. \n\n(c) BGE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss. \n\n14. Retirement Benefits (All Registrants) \n\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for essentially all current employees. Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective February 1, 2018 for most newly-hired BSC non-represented, non-craft, employees, January 1, 2021 for most newly-hired utility management employees, and for certain newly-hired union employees pursuant to their collective bargaining agreements, these newly-hired employees are not eligible for pension benefits, and will instead be eligible to receive an enhanced non-discretionary employer contribution in an Exelon defined contribution savings plan. Effective January 1, 2018, most newly-hired non-represented, non-craft, employees are not eligible for OPEB benefits and employees represented by Local 614 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2021, most non-represented, non-craft, employees who are under the age of 40 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2022, management employees retiring on or after that date are no longer eligible for retiree life insurance benefits. \n\nEffective February 1, 2022, in connection with the separation, pension and OPEB obligations and assets for current and former employees of the Constellation business and certain other former employees of Exelon and its subsidiaries transferred to pension and OPEB plans and trusts maintained by Constellation or its subsidiaries. The Exelon New England Union Employees Pension Plan and Constellation Mystic Power, LLC Union Employees Pension Plan Including Plan A and Plan B were transferred. The following OPEB plans were also transferred: Constellation Mystic Power, LLC Post-Employment Medical Savings Account Plan; Exelon New England Union Post-Employment Medical Savings Account Plan; and the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, LLC Medical Care and Prescription Drug Plan for Retired Employees. \n\nAs a result of the separation, Exelon restructured certain of its qualified pension plans. Pension obligations and assets for current and former employees continuing with Exelon and who were participants in the Exelon Employee Pension Plan for Clinton, TMI, and Oyster Creek, Pension Plan of Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, LLC, and Nine Mile Point Pension Plan were merged into the Pension Plan of Constellation Energy Group, Inc, which was subsequently renamed, Exelon Pension Plan (EPP). Exelon employees who participated in these plans prior to the separation now participate in the EPP. The merging of the plans did not change the benefits offered to the plan participants and, thus, had no impact on Exelon's pension obligations. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits \n\nThe tables below show the pension and OPEB plans in which employees of each operating company participated as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Company (e) \n\nName of Plan: ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE Qualified Pension Plans: \n\nExelon Corporation Retirement Program (a) \n\nX X X X X X X \n\nExelon Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees (a) \n\nX \n\nExelon Pension Plan (b) \n\nX X X X X X X \n\nPepco Holdings LLC Retirement Plan (d) \n\nX X X X X X X Non-Qualified Pension Plans: \n\nExelon Corporation Supplemental Pension Benefit Plan and 2000 Excess Benefit Plan (a) \n\nX X X \n\nExelon Corporation Supplemental Management Retirement Plan (a) \n\nX X X X X \n\nConstellation Energy Group, Inc.

Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated as qualified trusts under the IRC. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain IRC limitations. \n\nBenefit Obligations, Plan Assets, and Funded Status \n\nAs of February 1, 2022, in connection with the separation, Exelon's pension and OPEB plans were remeasured. The remeasurement and separation resulted in a decrease to the pension obligation, net of plan assets, of $ 921 million and a decrease to the OPEB obligation of $ 893 million. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss, decreased by $ 1,994 million (after-tax) and regulatory assets and liabilities increased by $ 14 million and $ 5 million respectively. Key assumptions were held consistent with the year end December 31, 2021 assumptions with the exception of the discount rate. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Exelon received an updated valuation of its pension and OPEB to reflect actual census data as of February 1, 2022. This valuation resulted in a decrease to the pension obligations of $ 24 million and an increase to the OPEB obligations of $ 5 million. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $ 5 million (after-tax) and regulatory assets and liabilities decreased by $ 30 million and $ 3 million, respectively. \n\nThe following tables provide a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets of Exelon for the most recent two years for all plans combined: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits OPEB 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation: Net benefit obligation as of the beginning of year $ 14,236 &#160; $ 14,861 &#160; $ 2,502 &#160; $ 2,661 &#160; Service cost 236 &#160; 294 &#160; 41 &#160; 51 &#160; Interest cost 439 &#160; 406 &#160; 76 &#160; 69 &#160; Plan participants&#8217; contributions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 26 &#160; 32 &#160; Actuarial (gain) loss (a) \n\n( 3,379 ) ( 442 ) ( 604 ) ( 116 ) Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 23 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 5 ) Gross benefits paid ( 855 ) ( 860 ) ( 157 ) ( 190 ) Net benefit obligation as of the end of year $ 10,677 &#160; $ 14,236 &#160; $ 1,884 &#160; $ 2,502 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits OPEB 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in plan assets: Fair value of net plan assets as of the beginning of year $ 12,165 &#160; $ 11,883 &#160; $ 1,665 &#160; $ 1,635 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 2,359 ) 822 &#160; ( 225 ) 130 &#160; Employer contributions 570 &#160; 343 &#160; 42 &#160; 63 &#160; Plan participants&#8217; contributions &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 26 &#160; 32 &#160; Gross benefits paid ( 855 ) ( 860 ) ( 157 ) ( 190 ) Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 23 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 5 ) Fair value of net plan assets as of the end of year $ 9,521 &#160; $ 12,165 &#160; $ 1,351 &#160; $ 1,665 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) The pension and OPEB gains in 2022 and 2021 primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits \n\nExelon presents its benefit obligations and plan assets net on its Consolidated Balance Sheets within the following line items: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits OPEB 2022 2021 2022 2021 Other current liabilities $ 47 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 26 &#160; Pension obligations 1,109 &#160; 2,051 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-pension postretirement benefit obligations &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 507 &#160; 811 &#160; Unfunded status (net benefit obligation less plan assets) $ 1,156 &#160; $ 2,071 &#160; $ 533 &#160; $ 837 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides the ABO and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets.

The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions and inputs, as shown below, among other factors. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. \n\nExpected Rate of Return. In determining the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon&#8217;s target asset class allocations. \n\nMortality . The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Exelon&#8217;s mortality assumption utilizes the SOA 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2021 improvement scale adjusted to use Proxy SSA ultimate improvement rates. \n\nFor Exelon, the following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year&#8217;s net periodic benefit costs. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits OPEB 2022 &#160; 2021 &#160; 2022 &#160; 2021 \n\nDiscount rate (a) \n\n5.53 &#160; % 2.92 &#160; % 5.51 &#160; % 2.88 &#160; % \n\nInvestment crediting rate (b) \n\n5.07 &#160; % \n\n3.75 &#160; % N/A N/A Rate of compensation increase 3.75 &#160; % 3.75 &#160; % 3.75 &#160; % 3.75 &#160; % Mortality table Pri-2012 table with MP- 2021 improvement scale (adjusted) Pri-2012 table with MP- 2021 improvement scale (adjusted) Pri-2012 table with MP- 2021 improvement scale (adjusted) &#160; Pri-2012 table with MP- 2021 improvement scale (adjusted) Health care cost trend on covered charges N/A N/A \n\nInitial and ultimate rate of 5.00 % \n\nInitial and ultimate trend of 5.00 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) The discount rates above represent the blended rates used to determine the majority of Exelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB obligations.

The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an ABO basis over time. This funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are subject to change, Exelon&#8217;s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be approximately $ 20 million in 2023. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon&#8217;s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. \n\nWhile OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans. For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon&#8217;s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid, and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). The amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans. \n\nThe following table provides all Registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to OPEB plans in 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START Qualified Pension Plans Non-Qualified Pension Plans OPEB Exelon $ 20 &#160; $ 48 &#160; $ 47 &#160; ComEd 20 &#160; 3 &#160; 19 &#160; PECO &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; BGE &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 15 &#160; PHI &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; 11 &#160; Pepco &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 11 &#160; DPL &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ACE &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits \n\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments \n\nEstimated future benefit payments to participants in all of the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2022 were: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits OPEB 2023 $ 805 &#160; $ 152 &#160; 2024 775 &#160; 152 &#160; 2025 789 &#160; 152 &#160; 2026 790 &#160; 152 &#160; 2027 798 &#160; 153 &#160; 2028 through 2032 3,983 &#160; 744 &#160; Total estimated future benefits payments through 2032 $ 7,940 &#160; $ 1,505 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPlan Assets \n\nInvestment Strategy. On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy. \n\nExelon has developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans&#8217; liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for Exelon&#8217;s OPEB plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility. \n\nActual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and OPEB plans. The actual asset returns across Exelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB plans for the year ended December 31, 2022 were ( 18.69 )% and ( 11.36 )%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of 7.00 % and 6.44 %, respectively. Exelon used an EROA of 7.00 % and 6.50 % to estimate its 2023 pension and OPEB costs, respectively. \n\nExelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB plan target asset allocations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Asset Category Pension Benefits OPEB Pension Benefits OPEB Equity securities 28 &#160; % 44 &#160; % 35 &#160; % 44 &#160; % Fixed income securities 44 &#160; % 41 &#160; % 41 &#160; % 41 &#160; % \n\nAlternative investments (a) \n\n28 &#160; % 15 &#160; % 24 &#160; % 15 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and private credit. \n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk. Exelon evaluated its pension and OPEB plans&#8217; asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2022. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2022, there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10% of plan assets) of risk in Exelon&#8217;s pension and OPEB plan assets. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212;

These items are required to reconcile to the fair value of net plan assets and consist primarily of receivables or payables related to pending securities sales and purchases, interest and dividends receivable, and repurchase agreement obligations. The repurchase agreements generally have maturities ranging from 3-6 months. \n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities for Exelon measured at fair value for pension and OPEB plans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Fixed Income Equities Private Credit Total Pension Assets Balance as of January 1, 2022 $ 337 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 130 &#160; $ 469 &#160; Actual return on plan assets: Relating to assets still held as of the reporting date ( 9 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 15 ) ( 24 ) Relating to assets sold during the \n\nperiod \n\n( 19 ) &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; ( 6 ) Purchases, sales and settlements: Purchases &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; Settlements (a) \n\n( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 52 ) ( 53 ) \n\nTransfers out of Level 3 (b) \n\n( 296 ) ( 2 ) ( 83 ) ( 381 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 12 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 12 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fixed Income Equities Private Credit Total Pension Assets Balance as of January 1, 2021 $ 348 &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 136 &#160; $ 485 &#160; Actual return on plan assets: Relating to assets still held as of the \n\nreporting date \n\n( 12 ) &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; 6 &#160; Purchases, sales and settlements: Purchases 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 15 &#160; Settlements (a) \n\n( 13 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 29 ) ( 42 ) Transfers into Level 3 4 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 337 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 130 &#160; $ 469 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Represents cash settlements only. \n\n(b) In 2022, transfers relate to changes in investment structure for certain investments due to the separation. \n\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value \n\nThe techniques used to fair value the pension and OPEB assets invested in cash equivalents are the same as the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial assets. See Cash Equivalents in Note 17 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for further information. Below outlines the techniques used to fair value the pension and OPEB assets invested in equities, fixed income, derivatives, private credit, private equity, and real estate investments. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits \n\nEquities. These investments consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds, and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign markets. With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon is able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights, and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. The equity securities that are held directly by the trust funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Certain equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs. \n\nEquity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies, and fund investments are held in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments can typically be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions. \n\nFixed income. For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, foreign government securities, municipal bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds, and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2. \n\nOther fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and hold fund investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions. \n\nDerivative instruments. These instruments, consisting primarily of futures and swaps to manage risk, are recorded at fair value. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued daily, based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1. Derivative instruments other than over-the-counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2. \n\nPrivate credit. Private credit investments primarily consist of investments in private debt strategies. These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3 to 5 years and are intended to be held to maturity. The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. Private credit investments held directly by Exelon are categorized as Level 3 because they are based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. For managed private credit funds, the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 14 &#8212; Retirement Benefits \n\ncost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. Managed private credit fund investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient. \n\nPrivate equity. These investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, and investments in natural resources. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date, which is based on Exelon's understanding of the investment funds. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, and market based comparable data. These valuation inputs are unobservable. The fair value of private equity investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nReal estate. These investments are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are reported by the fund manager and are generally based on independent appraisals of the underlying investments from sources with professional qualifications, typically using a combination of market based comparable data and discounted cash flows. These valuation inputs are unobservable. Certain real estate investments cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date, which is based on Exelon's understanding of the investment funds. The remaining liquid real estate investments are generally redeemable from the investment vehicle quarterly, with 30 to 90 days of notice. The fair value of real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nPension and OPEB assets also include investments in hedge funds. Hedge fund investments include those that employ a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, hedge funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions which may include a lock-up period or a gate. \n\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan \n\nThe Registrants participate in a 401(k) defined contribution savings plan that is sponsored by Exelon. The plan is qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The following table presents the employer contributions and employer matching contributions to the savings plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, Exelon ComEd PECO BGE PHI Pepco DPL ACE 2022 $ 91 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 11 &#160; 14 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 2 &#160; 2021 90 &#160; 35 &#160; 12 &#160; 12 &#160; 14 &#160; 4 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; 2020 95 &#160; 36 &#160; 12 &#160; 13 &#160; 14 &#160; 4 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n15. Derivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants) \n\nThe Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. The Registrants do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes. \n\nAuthoritative guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings immediately. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include NPNS, cash flow hedges, and fair value hedges. At ComEd, derivative economic hedges related to commodities are recorded at fair value and offset by a corresponding regulatory asset or liability. At Exelon, derivative economic hedges related to interest rates are recorded at fair value and offsets are recorded to Electric operating revenues or Interest expense based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments \n\nFor all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts receivable or accounts payable are recorded when derivatives settle and revenue or expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed. At Exelon, derivative hedges that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value and offsets are recorded to AOCI. \n\nComEd&#8217;s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless ComEd is downgraded below investment grade. Cash collateral held by PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE must be deposited in an unaffiliated major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meets certain qualifications. \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nThe Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, which are either determined to be non-derivative or classified as economic hedges. The Utility Registrants procure electric and natural gas supply through a competitive procurement process approved by each of the respective state utility commissions. The Utility Registrants&#8217; hedging programs are intended to reduce exposure to energy and natural gas price volatility and have no direct earnings impact as the costs are fully recovered from customers through regulatory-approved recovery mechanisms. The following table provides a summary of the Utility Registrants&#8217; primary derivative hedging instruments, listed by commodity and accounting treatment. \n\n##TABLE_START Registrant Commodity Accounting Treatment Hedging Instrument ComEd Electricity NPNS Fixed price contracts based on all requirements in the IPA procurement plans.

Exelon Corporate may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in rate levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as cash flow hedges. In addition, Exelon Corporate may also utilize interest rate \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments \n\nswaps to manage interest rate exposure and manage potential fluctuations in Electric operating revenues at the corporate level in consolidation, which are directly correlated to yields on U.S. Treasury bonds under ComEd's distribution formula rate. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as economic hedges. A hypothetical 50 basis point change in the interest rates associated with Exelon's interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2022 would result in an immaterial impact to Exelon's Consolidated Net Income. Below is a summary of the interest rate hedge balances as of December 31, 2022. Exelon had no interest rate hedge activity in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Economic Hedges Total Other deferred debits (noncurrent assets) $ 6 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ 11 &#160; Total derivative assets 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 11 &#160; Mark-to-market derivative liabilities (current liabilities) &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Mark-to-market derivative liabilities (noncurrent liabilities) ( 4 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 4 ) Total mark-to-market derivative liabilities ( 4 ) ( 3 ) ( 7 ) Total mark-to-market derivative net assets $ 2 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCash Flow Hedges (Interest Rate Risk) \n\nFor derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value each period are initially recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction affects earnings. In 2022, Exelon Corporate entered into $ 635 million notional of 5-year maturity floating-to-fixed swaps and $ 635 million notional of 10-year maturity floating-to-fixed swaps, for a total of $ 1,270 million as of December 31, 2022. Exelon had no swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2021. In January 2023, Exelon Corporate entered into $ 115 million notional of 5-year maturity floating-to-fixed swaps and $ 115 million notional of 10-year maturity floating-to-fixed swaps, for a total of $ 230 million designated as cash flow hedges. The total notional of the swaps issued as of the balance sheet date and subsequently are $ 1,500 million. \n\nThe AOCI derivative gain is $ 2 million as of December 31, 2022. There were no amounts reclassified to Net Income in 2022. See Note 21 &#8211; Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for additional information. Exelon had no swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2021. \n\nEconomic Hedges (Interest Rate and Other Risk) \n\nExelon Corporate executes derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates but for which the fair value or cash flow hedge elections were not made. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, fair value is recorded on the balance sheet and changes in fair value each period are recognized in earnings or as a regulatory asset or liability, if regulatory requirements are met, each period. \n\nExelon Corporate enters into floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps to manage a portion of interest rate exposure in connection with existing borrowings. In 2022, Exelon Corporate entered into $ 1,000 million notional of 18-month maturity floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps and $ 850 million notional of 6-month maturity floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps, for a total of $ 1,850 million notional of floating-to-fixed interest rate cap swaps as of December 31, 2022. Exelon had no swaps as of December 31, 2021. \n\nAdditionally, to manage potential fluctuations in Electric operating revenues related to ComEd's distribution formula rate, Exelon Corporate enters into 30-year constant maturity treasury interest rate (Corporate 30-year treasury) swaps. As of December 31, 2022, Exelon Corporate entered into $ 500 million notional of calendar year 2023 Corporate 30-year treasury swaps. In January and February 2023, Exelon Corporate entered into a total of $ 1,500 million notional of calendar year 2023 Corporate 30-year treasury swaps. The total notional of the swaps issued as of the balance sheet date and subsequently are $ 2,000 million. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Exelon Corporate recognized the following net pre-tax mark-to-market losses which are also recognized in Net fair value changes related to derivatives in Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Exelon had no swaps for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 . \n\n##TABLE_START Loss Income Statement Location 2022 Electric operating revenues $ 2 &#160; Interest expense 3 &#160; Total $ 5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCredit Risk \n\nThe Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. The Utility Registrants have contracts to procure electric and natural gas supply that provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. If the exposure on the supply contract exceeds the amount of unsecured credit, the suppliers may be required to post collateral. The net credit exposure is mitigated primarily by the ability to recover procurement costs through customer rates. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of cash collateral held with external counterparties by Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE was $ 297 million, $ 77 million, $ 23 million, $ 197 million, $ 26 million, $ 121 million, and $ 50 million, respectively, which is recorded in Other current liabilities in Exelon's, ComEd's, BGE's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount for PECO was not material as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the amounts for ComEd and DPL were $ 41 million and $ 43 million, respectively. The amounts for Exelon, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and ACE were not material as of December 31, 2021. \n\nThe Utility Registrants&#8217; electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require them to post collateral. PECO&#8217;s, BGE&#8217;s, and DPL&#8217;s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO, BGE, and DPL to post collateral in the form of cash or credit support, which vary by contract and counterparty, with thresholds contingent upon PECO&#8217;s, BGE's, and DPL&#8217;s credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, PECO, BGE, and DPL were not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO, BGE, or DPL lost their investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2022, they could have been required to post collateral to their counterparties of $ 71 million, $ 119 million, and $ 15 million, respectively. \n\n16. Debt and Credit Agreements (All Registrants) \n\nShort-Term Borrowings \n\nExelon Corporate, ComEd, and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. PECO meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL, and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the PHI intercompany money pool. PHI Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements \n\nCommercial Paper \n\nThe following table reflects the Registrants' commercial paper programs supported by the revolving credit agreements and bilateral credit agreements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Credit Facility Size as of December 31, Outstanding Commercial Paper as of December 31, Average Interest Rate on Commercial Paper Borrowings as of December 31, Commercial Paper Issuer 2022 (a) \n\n2021 (a) \n\n2022 2021 2022 2021 \n\nExelon (b) \n\n$ 4,000 &#160; $ 3,700 &#160; $ 1,938 &#160; $ 599 &#160; 4.77 &#160; % 0.35 &#160; % ComEd 1,000 &#160; 1,000 &#160; 427 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4.71 &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % PECO 600 &#160; 600 &#160; 239 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4.71 &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % BGE 600 &#160; 600 &#160; 409 &#160; 130 &#160; 4.81 &#160; % 0.37 &#160; % \n\nPHI (c) \n\n900 &#160; 900 &#160; 414 &#160; 469 &#160; 4.78 &#160; % 0.35 &#160; % Pepco 300 &#160; \n\n(d) \n\n300 &#160; 299 &#160; 175 &#160; 4.79 &#160; % 0.33 &#160; % DPL 300 &#160; \n\n(d) \n\n300 &#160; 115 &#160; 149 &#160; 4.76 &#160; % 0.36 &#160; % ACE 300 &#160; \n\n(d) \n\n300 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 145 &#160; &#8212; &#160; % 0.35 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Excludes credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks.

Exelon Corporate had $ 449 million in outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2022 and no outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2021. \n\n(c) Represents the consolidated amounts of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. \n\n(d) The standard maximum program size for revolving credit facilities is $ 300 million each for Pepco, DPL and ACE based on the credit agreements in place. However, the facilities at Pepco, DPL, and ACE have the ability to flex to $ 500 million, $ 500 million, and $ 350 million, respectively. The borrowing capacity may be increased or decreased during the term of the facility, except that (i) the sum of the borrowing capacity must equal the total amount of the facility, and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by each of Pepco, DPL, or ACE may not exceed $ 900 million or the maximum amount of short-term debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities. The total number of the borrowing reallocations may not exceed eight per year during the term of the facility. As of December 23, 2022, this ability was utilized to increase Pepco's program size to $ 400 million. As a result, the program sizes for DPL and ACE were decreased to $ 250 million each, which prevents the aggregate amount of outstanding short-term debt from potentially exceeding the $ 900 million limit. \n\nIn order to maintain their respective commercial paper programs in the amounts indicated above, each Registrant must have credit facilities in place, at least equal to the amount of its commercial paper program. A registrant does not issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available capacity under its credit facility. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Registrants had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit facility borrowings, and available capacity under their respective credit facilities: \n\n##TABLE_START Available Capacity as of December 31, 2022 \n\nBorrower (a) \n\nFacility Type Aggregate Bank Commitment (b) \n\nFacility Draws Outstanding Letters of Credit Actual To Support \n\nAdditional \n\nCommercial Paper (c) \n\nExelon (c) \n\nSyndicated Revolver $ 4,000 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ 3,992 &#160; $ 2,054 &#160; ComEd Syndicated Revolver 1,000 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 995 &#160; 568 &#160; PECO Syndicated Revolver 600 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 600 &#160; 361 &#160; BGE Syndicated Revolver 600 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 600 &#160; 191 &#160; \n\nPHI (d) \n\nSyndicated Revolver 900 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 900 &#160; 486 &#160; Pepco Syndicated Revolver 300 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 300 &#160; 1 &#160; DPL Syndicated Revolver 300 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 300 &#160; 185 &#160; ACE Syndicated Revolver 300 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 300 &#160; 300 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) On February 1, 2022, Exelon Corporate and the Utility Registrants' respective syndicated revolving credit facilities were replaced with a new 5-year revolving credit facility. \n\n(b) Excludes credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks.

The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit ratings of the borrower. \n\nShort-Term Loan Agreements \n\nOn March 23, 2017, Exelon Corporate entered into a term loan agreement for $ 500 million. The loan agreement was renewed on March 14, 2022 and will expire on March 16, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, loans made thereunder bear interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 0.65 % and all indebtedness thereunder is unsecured. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings. \n\nOn March 31, 2021, Exelon Corporate entered into a 364-day term loan agreement for $ 150 million with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.65 % and an expiration date of March 30, 2022. Exelon Corporate repaid the term loan on March 30, 2022. \n\nIn connection with the separation, on January 24, 2022, Exelon Corporate entered into a 364-day term loan agreement for $ 1.15 billion. The loan agreement had an expiration date of January 23, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, loans made thereunder bore interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 0.75 % until July 23, 2022 and a rate of SOFR plus 0.975 % thereafter. All indebtedness pursuant to the loan agreement was unsecured. On August 11, 2022, Exelon Corporate made a partial repayment of $ 575 million on the term loan. On October 11, 2022, the remaining $ 575 million outstanding balance was repaid in conjunction with the $ 500 million 18-month term loan that was entered into on October 7, 2022. \n\nOn October 4, 2022, ComEd entered into a 364-day term loan agreement for $ 150 million with a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 0.75 % and an expiration date of October 3, 2023. The proceeds from this loan were used to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations. The loan agreement is reflected in Exelon's and ComEd's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Short-term borrowings. The balance of the loan was repaid on January 13, 2023 in conjunction with the $ 400 million and $ 575 million First Mortgage Bond agreements that were entered into on January 3, 2023. \n\nVariable Rate Demand Bonds \n\nDPL has outstanding obligations in respect of Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDB). VRDBs are subject to repayment on the demand of the holders and, for this reason, are accounted for as short-term debt in \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements \n\naccordance with GAAP.

The Registrants have no financial liabilities classified as Level 1 or measured using the NAV practical expedient. \n\nThe carrying amounts of the Registrants&#8217; short-term liabilities as presented in their Consolidated Balance Sheets are representative of their fair value (Level 2) because of the short-term nature of these instruments. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 17 &#8212; Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 2 Level 3 Total \n\nLong-Term Debt, including amounts due within one year (a) \n\nExelon $ 37,074 &#160; $ 29,902 &#160; $ 2,327 &#160; $ 32,229 &#160; $ 32,902 &#160; $ 34,897 &#160; $ 2,217 &#160; $ 37,114 &#160; ComEd 10,518 &#160; 9,006 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9,006 &#160; 9,773 &#160; 11,305 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,305 &#160; PECO 4,612 &#160; 3,864 &#160; 50 &#160; 3,914 &#160; 4,197 &#160; 4,740 &#160; 50 &#160; 4,790 &#160; BGE 4,207 &#160; 3,613 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,613 &#160; 3,961 &#160; 4,406 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,406 &#160; PHI 8,120 &#160; 4,507 &#160; 2,277 &#160; 6,784 &#160; 7,547 &#160; 5,970 &#160; 2,167 &#160; 8,137 &#160; Pepco 3,751 &#160; 2,229 &#160; 1,205 &#160; 3,434 &#160; 3,445 &#160; 3,201 &#160; 975 &#160; 4,176 &#160; DPL 1,938 &#160; 1,164 &#160; 458 &#160; 1,622 &#160; 1,810 &#160; 1,426 &#160; 552 &#160; 1,978 &#160; ACE 1,757 &#160; 909 &#160; 614 &#160; 1,523 &#160; 1,582 &#160; 1,091 &#160; 641 &#160; 1,732 &#160; Long-Term Debt to Financing Trusts Exelon $ 390 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 384 &#160; $ 384 &#160; $ 390 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 470 &#160; $ 470 &#160; ComEd 205 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 204 &#160; 204 &#160; 205 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 248 &#160; 248 &#160; PECO 184 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 180 &#160; 180 &#160; 184 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 222 &#160; 222 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Includes unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount and premium, net, purchase accounting fair value adjustments, and finance lease liabilities which are not fair valued.

Exelon obtains credit spreads based on trades of existing Exelon debt securities as well as other issuers in the utility sector with similar credit ratings. The yields are then converted into discount rates of various tenors that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note. Variable Rate Financing Debt 2 Exelon, DPL Debt rates are reset on a regular basis and the carrying value approximates fair value. Taxable Private Placement Debt Securities 3 Exelon, Pepco, DPL, ACE Rates are obtained similar to the process for taxable debt securities. Due to low trading volume and qualitative factors such as market conditions, low volume of investors, and investor demand, these debt securities are Level 3. Non-Government Backed Fixed Rate Nonrecourse Debt 3 Exelon, Pepco Fair value is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk profiles. Given the low trading volume in the nonrecourse debt market, the price quotes used to determine fair value will reflect certain qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, new developments that might significantly impact the project cash flows or off-taker credit, and other circumstances related to the project. Long-Term Debt to Financing Trusts Long Term Debt to Financing Trusts 3 Exelon, ComEd, PECO Fair value is based on publicly traded securities issued by the financing trusts. Due to low trading volume of these securities and qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, and circumstances related to each issue, this debt is classified as Level 3. ##TABLE_END\n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 17 &#8212; Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities \n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements \n\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value in the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Includes $ 62 million of increases in fair value and an increase for realized losses due to settlements of $ 20 million recorded in purchased power expense associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n(c) The balance of the current and noncurrent asset was effectively zero as of December 31, 2022. The balance consists of a current and noncurrent liability of $ 5 million and $ 79 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. \n\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value \n\nCash Equivalents (All Registrants). Investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, including mutual and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1. \n\nRabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE). The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon&#8217;s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts' assets are included in investments in the Registrants&#8217; Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, fixed \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 17 &#8212; Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities \n\nincome securities, and life insurance policies. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the prices. The fair values of fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of mutual funds that are priced based on observable market data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets. Life insurance policies that are valued using unobservable inputs have been categorized as Level 3, where the fair value is determined based on the cash surrender value of the policy, which contains unobservable inputs and assumptions. Because Exelon relies on its third-party insurance provider to develop the inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Exelon. Therefore, Exelon has not disclosed such inputs. \n\nInterest Rate Derivatives (Exelon) Exelon may utilize fixed-to-floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as a means to manage interest rate risk. These interest rate swaps are typically accounted for as economic hedges. In addition, Exelon may utilize interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate levels in anticipation of future financings. These interest rate derivatives are typically designated as cash flow hedges. Exelon determines the current fair value by calculating the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement, based on and discounted by the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and other market parameters. As these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the interest rate swaps are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on mark-to-market derivatives. \n\nDeferred Compensation Obligations (All Registrants). &#160; The Registrants&#8217; deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants&#8217; deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants&#8217; notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds, and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe value of certain employment agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred Compensation Obligation in the tables above) are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nMark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon and ComEd). On December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. Delivery under the contracts began in June 2012. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and the internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using forward power prices. See Note 15 &#8212; Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on mark-to-market derivatives. \n\nThe following table discloses the significant unobservable inputs to the forward curve used to value mark-to-market derivatives: \n\n##TABLE_START Type of trade Fair Value as of December 31, 2022 Fair Value as of December 31, 2021 Valuation Technique Unobservable Input 2022 Range &#38; Arithmetic Average 2021 Range &#38; Arithmetic Average Mark-to-market derivatives $ ( 84 ) $ ( 219 ) Discounted Cash Flow \n\nForward power price (a) \n\n$ 34.78 &#160; - $ 75.71 &#160; $ 48.44 &#160; $ 28.65 &#160; - $ 47.10 &#160; $ 33.96 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) An increase to the forward power price would increase the fair value. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\n18. Commitments and Contingencies (All Registrants) \n\nCommitments \n\nPHI Merger Commitments (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE). Approval of the PHI Merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments. The following amounts represent total commitment costs that have been recorded since the acquisition date and the total remaining obligations for Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Description Exelon PHI Pepco DPL ACE Total commitments $ 513 &#160; $ 320 &#160; $ 120 &#160; $ 89 &#160; $ 111 &#160; \n\nRemaining commitments (a) \n\n52 &#160; 45 &#160; 39 &#160; 4 &#160; 2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Remaining commitments extend through 2026 and include rate credits, energy efficiency programs, and delivery system modernization. \n\nIn addition, DPL has committed to conducting three RFPs to procure up to a total of 120 MWs of wind RECs for the purpose of meeting Delaware's renewable portfolio standards. DPL has completed the three required wind REC RFPs. The first 40 MW wind REC tranche was conducted in 2017 and did not result in a purchase agreement. The second 40 MW wind REC tranche was conducted in 2018 and resulted in a proposed REC purchase agreement that was approved by the DEPSC in 2019. The third and final 40 MW wind REC tranche was conducted in 2022 and did not result in a purchase agreement. On December 14, 2022, the DEPSC issued an order recognizing DPL&#8217;s completion of all obligations under this merger commitment. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nCommercial Commitments (All Registrants).

The lease term associated with these assets ranges from 1 to 8 years. The maximum potential obligation at the end of the minimum lease term would be $ 68 million guaranteed by Exelon and PHI, of which $ 22 million , $ 28 million, and $ 18 million is guaranteed by Pepco, DPL, and ACE, respectively. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made and PHI believes the likelihood of payments being required under the guarantees is remote. \n\nEnvironmental Remediation Matters \n\nGeneral (All Registrants). The Registrants&#8217; operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Unless otherwise disclosed, the Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers. Additional costs could have a material, unfavorable impact on the Registrants' financial statements. \n\nMGP Sites (All Registrants). ComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL have identified sites where former MGP or gas purification activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For some sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location. \n\n&#8226; ComEd has 20 sites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2031. \n\n&#8226; PECO has 6 sites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2024. \n\n&#8226; BGE has 4 sites that currently require some level of remediation and/or ongoing activity. BGE expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2025. \n\n&#8226; DPL has 1 site that is currently under study and the required cost at the site is not expected to be material. \n\nThe historical nature of the MGP and gas purification sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using all available information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency. \n\nComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to a PAPUC order, are currently recovering environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. While BGE and DPL do not have riders for MGP clean-up costs, they have historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates. \n\nIn 2022, ComEd and PECO completed an annual study of their future estimated MGP remediation requirements. The study resulted in a $ 60 million increase to the environmental liability and related regulatory asset for ComEd. The increase was primarily due to increased costs due to inflation and changes in remediation plans. The study did not result in a material change to the environmental liability for PECO. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in Accrued expenses, Other current liabilities, and Other deferred credits and other liabilities in their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total environmental investigation and remediation liabilities Portion of total related to MGP investigation and remediation Total environmental investigation and remediation liabilities Portion of total related to MGP investigation and remediation Exelon $ 409 &#160; $ 355 &#160; $ 352 &#160; $ 303 &#160; ComEd 325 &#160; 324 &#160; 279 &#160; 279 &#160; PECO 25 &#160; 23 &#160; 22 &#160; 20 &#160; BGE 9 &#160; 8 &#160; 6 &#160; 4 &#160; PHI 46 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 42 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Pepco 44 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 40 &#160; &#8212; &#160; DPL 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ACE 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nBenning Road Site (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco). In September 2010, PHI received a letter from EPA identifying the Benning Road site as one of six land-based sites potentially contributing to contamination of the lower Anacostia River. A portion of the site, which is owned by Pepco, was formerly the location of an electric generating facility owned by Pepco subsidiary, Pepco Energy Services (PES), which became a part of Generation, following the 2016 merger between PHI and Exelon. This generating facility was deactivated in June 2012. The remaining portion of the site consists of a Pepco transmission and distribution service center that remains in operation. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a Consent Decree entered into by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services (hereinafter \"Pepco Entities\") with the DOEE, which requires the Pepco Entities to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the Benning Road site and an approximately 10 to 15-acre portion of the adjacent Anacostia River. The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of contamination from the Benning Road site and to evaluate remedial alternatives. \n\nPursuant to an internal agreement between the Pepco Entities, since 2013, Pepco has performed the work required by the Consent Decree and has been reimbursed for that work by an agreed upon allocation of costs between the Pepco Entities. In September 2019, the Pepco Entities issued a draft &#8220;final&#8221; RI report which DOEE approved on February 3, 2020. The Pepco Entities are completing a FS to evaluate possible remedial alternatives for submission to DOEE. In October, 2022, DOEE approved dividing the work to complete the landside portion of the FS from the waterside portion to expedite the overall schedule for completion of the project. After completion and approval of the landside FS, now scheduled for September 2023, DOEE will prepare a Proposed Plan for public comment and then issue a Record of Decision (ROD) identifying any further response actions determined to be necessary to address any landside issues. The DOEE will issue a separate ROD for the waterside FS when that work is completed which is now anticipated to be by March 31, 2024. \n\nAs part of the separation between Exelon and Constellation in February 2022, the internal agreement between the Pepco Entities for completion and payment for the remaining Consent Decree work was memorialized in a formal agreement for post-separation activities. A second post-separation assumption agreement between Exelon and Constellation transferred any of the potential remaining remediation liability, if any, of PES/Generation to a non-utility subsidiary of Exelon which going forward will be responsible for those liabilities. Exelon, PHI, and Pepco have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have accrued an estimated liability, which is included in the table above. \n\nAnacostia River Tidal Reach (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco). Contemporaneous with the Benning Road site RI/FS being performed by the Pepco Entities, DOEE and NPS have been conducting a separate RI/FS focused on the entire tidal reach of the Anacostia River extending from just north of the Maryland-District of Columbia boundary line to the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. The river-wide RI incorporated the results of the river sampling performed by the Pepco Entities as part of the Benning RI/FS, as well as similar sampling efforts conducted by owners of other sites adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by DOEE&#8217;s contractor. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nOn September 30, 2020, DOEE released its Interim ROD. The Interim ROD reflects an adaptive management approach which will require several identified &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the river to be addressed first while continuing to conduct studies and to monitor the river to evaluate improvements and determine potential future remediation plans. The adaptive management process chosen by DOEE is less intrusive, provides more long-term environmental certainty, is less costly, and allows for site specific remediation plans already underway, including the plan for the Benning Road site to proceed to conclusion. \n\nOn July 15, 2022, Pepco received a letter from the District of Columbia's Office of the Attorney General (D.C. OAG) on behalf of DOEE conveying a settlement offer to resolve all PRPs' liability to the District of Columbia (District) for their past costs and their anticipated future costs to complete the work for the Interim ROD. Pepco responded on July 27, 2022 to enter into settlement discussions. Since that time Exelon and the other PRP&#8217;s at the site have exchanged letters with the D.C. OAG exploring potential settlement options. Those discussions are ongoing. Exelon, PHI, and Pepco have determined that it is probable that costs for remediation will be incurred and have accrued a liability for management's best estimate of its share of the costs. Pepco concluded that incremental exposure remains reasonably possible, but management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the amounts recorded, which are included in the table above. \n\nIn addition to the activities associated with the remedial process outlined above, CERCLA separately requires federal and state (here including Washington, D.C.) Natural Resource Trustees (federal or state agencies designated by the President or the relevant state, respectively, or Indian tribes) to conduct an assessment of any damages to natural resources within their jurisdiction as a result of the contamination that is being remediated. The Trustees can seek compensation from responsible parties for such damages, including restoration costs. During the second quarter of 2018, Pepco became aware that the Trustees are in the beginning stages of a Natural Resources Damages (NRD) assessment, a process that often takes many years beyond the remedial decision to complete. Pepco has entered into negotiations with the Trustees to evaluate possible incorporation of NRD assessment and restoration as part of its remedial activities associated with the Benning site to accelerate the NRD benefits for that portion of the Anacostia River Sediment Project (ARSP) assessment. Pepco has concluded that a loss associated with the eventual NRD assessment is reasonably possible. Due to the very early stage of the assessment process, Pepco cannot reasonably estimate the final range of loss potentially resulting from this process. \n\nAs noted in the Benning Road Site disclosure above, as part of the separation of Exelon and Constellation in February 2022, an assumption agreement was executed transferring any potential future remediation liabilities associated with the Benning Site remediation to a non-utility subsidiary of Exelon. Similarly, any potential future liability associated with the ARSP was also assumed by this entity. \n\nBuzzard Point Site (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco). On December 8, 2022, Pepco received a letter from the D.C. OAG, alleging wholly past violations of the District's stormwater discharge and waste disposal requirements related to operations at the Buzzard Point facility, a 9-acre parcel of waterfront property in Washington, D.C. occupied by an active substation and former steam plant building. The letter also alleged wholly past violations by Pepco of stormwater discharge requirements related to its district-wide system of underground vaults. The D.C. OAG invited Pepco to resolve the threatened enforcement action through a court-approved consent decree, and Pepco is engaged in discussions with the D.C. OAG regarding a potential resolution. Exelon, PHI, and Pepco have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have accrued an estimated liability. Due to the very early stage of the assessment process, Pepco concluded that incremental exposure is reasonably possible, but the range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated beyond the amounts included in the table above. \n\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters \n\nFund Transfer Restrictions (All Registrants). Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon&#8217;s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool. \n\nUnder applicable law, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, or ACE may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to Exelon. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nComEd has agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No such event has occurred. \n\nPECO has agreed in connection with financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued. No such event has occurred. \n\nBGE is subject to restrictions established by the MDPSC that prohibit BGE from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE&#8217;s equity ratio would be below 48 % as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC&#8217;s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE&#8217;s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred. \n\nPepco is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved by the MDPSC and DCPSC that prohibit Pepco from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, Pepco's equity ratio would be 48 % as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC's and DCPSC's ratemaking precedents, of or (b) Pepco&#8217;s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred. \n\nDPL is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved by the DEPSC and MDPSC that prohibit DPL from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, DPL's equity ratio would be 48 % as calculated pursuant to the DCPSC's and MDPSC's ratemaking precedents, or (b) DPL&#8217;s corporate issuer or senior unsecured credit rating, or its equivalent, is rated by any of the three major credit rating agencies below the generally accepted definition of investment grade. No such event has occurred. \n\nACE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved by the NJBPU that prohibit ACE from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, ACE's common equity ratio would be 48 % as calculated pursuant to the NJBPU's ratemaking precedents, or (b) ACE's senior corporate issuer or senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. ACE is also subject to a dividend restriction which requires ACE to notify and obtain the prior approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30 %. No such events have occurred. \n\nDPA and Related Matters (Exelon and ComEd). Exelon and ComEd received a grand jury subpoena in the second quarter of 2019 from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) requiring production of information concerning their lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, Exelon and ComEd received a second grand jury subpoena from the USAO requiring production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities. On October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had also opened an investigation into their lobbying activities. On July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a DPA with the USAO to resolve the USAO investigation. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker&#8217;s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker&#8217;s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd&#8217;s interests. The DPA provides that the USAO will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including payment to the U.S. Treasury of $ 200 million, which was paid in November 2020. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA, and therefore the investigation by the USAO into Exelon&#8217;s activities ended with no charges being brought against Exelon. The SEC&#8217;s investigation remains ongoing and Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the SEC. Exelon and ComEd cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation. No loss contingency has been reflected in Exelon's and ComEd's consolidated financial statements with respect to the SEC investigation, as this contingency is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nSubsequent to Exelon announcing the receipt of the subpoenas, various lawsuits were filed, and various demand letters were received related to the subject of the subpoenas, the conduct described in the DPA and the SEC's investigation, including: \n\n&#8226; Four putative class action lawsuits against ComEd and Exelon were filed in federal court on behalf of ComEd customers in the third quarter of 2020 alleging, among other things, civil violations of federal racketeering laws. In addition, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to intervene in these cases on October 22, 2020 which was granted on December 23, 2020. On December 2, 2020, the court appointed interim lead plaintiffs in the federal cases which consisted of counsel for three of the four federal cases. These plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on January 5, 2021. CUB also filed its own complaint against ComEd only on the same day. The remaining federal case, Potter, et al. v. Exelon et al, differed from the other lawsuits as it named additional individual defendants not named in the consolidated complaint. However, the Potter plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaint without prejudice on April 5, 2021. ComEd and Exelon moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint and CUB&#8217;s complaint on February 4, 2021 and briefing was completed on March 22, 2021. On March 25, 2021, the parties agreed, along with state court plaintiffs, discussed below, to jointly engage in mediation. The parties participated in a one-day mediation on June 7, 2021 but no settlement was reached. On September 9, 2021, the federal court granted Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s motion to dismiss and dismissed the plaintiffs&#8217; and CUB&#8217;s federal law claim with prejudice. The federal court also dismissed the related state law claims made by the federal plaintiffs and CUB on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs appealed dismissal of the federal law claim to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Plaintiffs and CUB also refiled their state law claims in state court and moved to consolidate them with the already pending consumer state court class action, discussed below. On August 22, 2022, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated federal cases in their entirety. The time to further appeal has passed and the Seventh Circuit&#8217;s decision is final. \n\n&#8226; Three putative class action lawsuits against ComEd and Exelon were filed in Illinois state court in the third quarter of 2020 seeking restitution and compensatory damages on behalf of ComEd customers. The cases were consolidated into a single action in October of 2020. In November 2020, CUB filed a motion to intervene in the cases pursuant to an Illinois statute allowing CUB to intervene as a party or otherwise participate on behalf of utility consumers in any proceeding which affects the interest of utility consumers. On November 23, 2020, the court allowed CUB&#8217;s intervention, but denied CUB's request to stay these cases. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a consolidated complaint, and ComEd and Exelon filed a motion to dismiss on jurisdictional and substantive grounds on January 11, 2021. Briefing on that motion was completed on March 2, 2021. The parties agreed, on March 25, 2021, along with the federal court plaintiffs discussed above, to jointly engage in mediation. The parties participated in a one-day mediation on June 7, 2021 but no settlement was reached. On December 23, 2021, the state court granted ComEd and Exelon&#8217;s motion to dismiss with prejudice. On December 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider that dismissal and for permission to amend their complaint. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion on January 21, 2022. Plaintiffs have appealed the court's ruling dismissing their complaint to the First District Court of Appeals. On February 15, 2022, Exelon and ComEd moved to dismiss the federal plaintiffs' refiled state law claims, seeking dismissal on the same legal grounds asserted in their motion to dismiss the original state court plaintiffs' complaint. The court granted dismissal of the refiled state claims on February 16, 2022. The original federal plaintiffs appealed that dismissal on February 18, 2022. The two state appeals were consolidated on March 21, 2022. Plaintiffs' opening appellate brief was filed on August 5, 2022. Exelon and ComEd's response was filed on November 18, 2022. Plaintiffs filed their reply brief on January 13, 2023. \n\n&#8226; On November 3, 2022, a plaintiff filed a complaint with the Lake County, Illinois Circuit Court against ComEd and Exelon for unjust enrichment and deceptive business practices in connection with the conduct giving rise to the DPA. Plaintiff seeks an accounting and disgorgement of any benefits ComEd allegedly obtained from said conduct. ComEd and Exelon filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on February 3, 2023. Plaintiff&#8217;s response is due March 3, 2023, and ComEd and Exelon&#8217;s reply is due March 24, 2023. Oral argument on the motion to dismiss is currently set for April 21, 2023. Plaintiffs served initial discovery requests on ComEd in December 2022, to which ComEd has responded. \n\n&#8226; A putative class action lawsuit against Exelon and certain officers of Exelon and ComEd was filed in federal court in December 2019 alleging misrepresentations and omissions in Exelon&#8217;s SEC filings related to ComEd&#8217;s lobbying activities and the related investigations. The complaint was amended on \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nSeptember 16, 2020, to dismiss two of the original defendants and add other defendants, including ComEd. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in November 2020. The court denied the motion in April 2021. On May 26, 2021, defendants moved the court to certify its order denying the motion to dismiss for interlocutory appeal. Briefing on the motion was completed in June 2021. That motion was denied on January 28, 2022. In May 2021, the parties each filed respective initial discovery disclosures. On June 9, 2021, defendants filed their answer and affirmative defenses to the complaint and the parties engaged thereafter in discovery. On September 9, 2021, the U.S. government moved to intervene in the lawsuit and stay discovery until the parties entered into an amendment to their protective order that would prohibit the parties from requesting discovery into certain matters, including communications with the U.S. government. The court ordered said amendment to the protective order on November 15, 2021 and discovery resumed. The court further amended the protective order on October 17, 2022 and extended it until May 15, 2023. The next court status is set for May 8, 2023. Discovery remains ongoing. \n\n&#8226; Several shareholders have sent letters to the Exelon Board of Directors from 2020 through May 2022 demanding, among other things, that the Exelon Board of Directors investigate and address alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and other alleged violations by Exelon and ComEd officers and directors related to the conduct described in the DPA. In the first quarter of 2021, the Exelon Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee (SLC) consisting of disinterested and independent parties to investigate and address these shareholders' allegations and make recommendations to the Exelon Board of Directors based on the outcome of the SLC's investigation. In July 2021, one of the demand letter shareholders filed a derivative action against current and former Exelon and ComEd officers and directors, and against Exelon, as nominal defendant, asserting the same claims made in its demand letter. On October 12, 2021, the parties to the derivative action filed an agreed motion to stay that litigation for 120 days in order to allow the SLC to continue its investigation, which the court granted. The stay has been extended, by agreement of the parties several times and is currently in effect until March 17, 2023. The Parties have scheduled a mediation of this action for February 2023. \n\n&#8226; Two separate shareholder requests seeking review of certain Exelon books and records were received in August 2021 and January 2022. Exelon responded to both requests and both shareholders have since sent formal shareholder demands to the Exelon Board, as discussed above. \n\nNo loss contingencies have been reflected in Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s consolidated financial statements with respect to these matters, as such contingencies are neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time. \n\nIn August 2022, the ICC concluded its investigation initiated on August 12, 2021 into rate impacts of conduct admitted in the DPA, including the costs recovered from customers related to the DPA and Exelon's funding of the fine paid by ComEd. On August 17, 2022, the ICC issued its final order accepting ComEd's voluntary customer refund offer of approximately $ 38 million (of which about $ 31 million is ICC jurisdictional; the remaining balance is FERC jurisdictional) that resolves the question of whether customer funds were used for DPA related activities. The customer refund includes the cost of every individual or entity that was either (i) identified in the DPA or (ii) identified by ComEd as an associate of the former Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives in the ICC proceeding. The ICC rejected an argument by the Illinois Attorney General, City of Chicago, and CUB that a costly permanent adjustment also needed to be made to ComEd's ratemaking capital structure on account of Exelon having funded ComEd's payment of the DPA fine with an equity infusion. On October 6, the ICC denied the application for rehearing filed by the Illinois Attorney General, City of Chicago, and CUB that specifically focused on their capital structure argument. The window to file an appeal on the ICC final order has expired and the ICC&#8217;s DPA investigation is now closed. An accrual for the amount of the voluntary customer refund has been recorded in Regulatory liabilities and Regulatory assets in Exelon&#8217;s and ComEd&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. The ICC jurisdictional refund must be made in April 2023; the FERC jurisdictional refund will be made as part of the next transmission formula rate update proceeding in 2023. The customer refund will not be recovered in rates or charged to customers and ComEd will not seek or accept reimbursement or indemnification from any source other than Exelon. \n\nSavings Plan Claim (Exelon). On December 6, 2021, seven current and former employees filed a putative ERISA class action suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Exelon, its Board of Directors, the former Board Investment Oversight Committee, the Corporate Investment Committee, individual defendants, and other unnamed fiduciaries of the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan (Plan). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties under the Plan by including certain investment options that allegedly were more expensive than and underperformed similar passively-managed or \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 18 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies \n\nother funds available in the marketplace and permitting a third-party administrative service provider/recordkeeper and an investment adviser to charge excessive fees for the services provided. The plaintiffs seek declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the Plan and participants. On February 16, 2022, the court granted the parties' stipulated dismissal of the individual named defendants without prejudice. The remaining defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on February 25, 2022. On March 4, 2022, the Chamber of Commerce filed a brief of amicus curiae in support of the defendants' motion to dismiss. On September 22, 2022, the court granted Exelon&#8217;s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The court granted plaintiffs leave until October 31, 2022 to file an amended complaint, which was later extended to November 30, 2022. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on November 30, 2022. Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint on January 20, 2023. Plaintiffs' response is due February 17, 2023, and defendants' reply is due February 24, 2023. No loss contingencies have been reflected in Exelon&#8217;s consolidated financial statements with respect to this matter, as such contingencies are neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time. \n\nGeneral (All Registrants). The Registrants are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The Registrants are also from time to time subject to audits and investigations by the FERC and other regulators. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss. \n\n19. Shareholders' Equity (All Registrants) \n\nEquity Securities Offering (Exelon) \n\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon entered into an agreement with certain underwriters in connection with an underwritten public offering (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;) of 11.3 million shares (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) of its common stock, no par value (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;). The Shares were sold to the underwriters at a price per share of $ 43.32 . Exelon also granted the underwriters an option to purchase an additional 1.695 million shares of Common Stock also at the price per share of $ 43.32 . On August 5, 2022, the underwriters exercised the option in full. The net proceeds from the Offering and the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option were $ 563 million before expenses paid by Exelon. Exelon used the proceeds, together with available cash balances, to repay $ 575 million in borrowings under a $ 1.15 billion term loan credit facility. See Note 16 &#8212; Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on Exelon&#8217;s term loan. \n\nAt-the-Market (ATM) Program (Exelon) \n\nOn August 4, 2022, Exelon executed an equity distribution agreement (&#8220;Equity Distribution Agreement&#8221;), with certain sales agents and forward sellers and certain forward purchasers, establishing an ATM equity distribution program under which it may offer and sell shares of its Common Stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $ 1.0 billion. Exelon has no obligation to offer or sell any shares of Common Stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may, at any time, suspend or terminate offers and sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, Exelon has not issued any shares of Common Stock under the ATM program and has not entered into any forward sale agreements. \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 19 &#8212; Shareholders' Equity \n\nComEd Common Stock Warrants \n\nThe following table presents warrants outstanding to purchase ComEd common stock and shares of common stock reserved for the conversion of warrants. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 \n\nWarrants outstanding \n\n60,052 &#160; 60,061 &#160; Common Stock reserved for conversion 20,017 &#160; 20,020 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nShare Repurchases \n\nThere currently is no Exelon Board of Director authority to repurchase shares. Any previous shares repurchased are held as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion of Exelon&#8217;s management. \n\nPreferred and Preference Securities \n\nThe following table presents Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, and ACE's shares of preferred securities authorized, none of which were outstanding, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. There are no shares of preferred securities authorized for DPL. \n\n##TABLE_START Preferred Securities Authorized Exelon 100,000,000 &#160; ComEd 850,000 &#160; PECO 15,000,000 &#160; BGE 1,000,000 &#160; Pepco 6,000,000 &#160; \n\nACE (a) \n\n2,799,979 &#160; ##TABLE_END _________ \n\n(a) Includes 799,979 shares of cumulative preferred stock and 2,000,000 of no-par preferred stock as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe following table presents ComEd's, BGE's, and ACE's preference securities authorized, none of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans (All Registrants) \n\nStock-Based Compensation Plans \n\nExelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily includes performance share awards, restricted stock units, and stock options. At December 31, 2022, there were approximately 34 million shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from authorized but unissued common stock shares. \n\nSeparation-related Adjustments. In connection with the separation, Exelon and Constellation entered into an Employee Matters Agreement, effective February 1, 2022. Under the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement, \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 20 &#8212; Stock-Based Compensation Plans \n\nand pursuant to the terms of the LTIP, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Exelon approved an adjustment to outstanding awards granted under the LTIP in order to preserve the intrinsic aggregate value of such awards before the separation. The separation-related adjustments did not have a material impact on either compensation expense or the potentially dilutive securities to be considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock. Former Exelon employees transferred to Constellation as a result of the separation surrendered their outstanding unvested Exelon awards effective February 1, 2022. \n\nThe Registrants grant cash awards. The following table does not include expense related to these plans as they are not considered stock-based compensation plans under the applicable authoritative guidance. \n\nThe following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in Exelon's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Utility Registrants' stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was not material. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Exelon 2022 2021 2020 Total stock-based compensation expense included in operating and maintenance expense $ 41 &#160; $ 95 &#160; $ 37 &#160; Income tax benefit ( 10 ) ( 25 ) ( 9 ) Total after-tax stock-based compensation expense $ 31 &#160; $ 70 &#160; $ 28 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nExelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs. The following table presents information regarding Exelon&#8217;s realized tax benefit when distributed: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Performance share awards $ 6 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ 15 &#160; Restricted stock units 6 &#160; 6 &#160; 8 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nPerformance Share Awards \n\nPerformance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The performance share awards are settled 50 % in common stock and 50 % in cash at the end of the three-year performance period, except for awards that are settled 100 % in cash if certain ownership requirements are satisfied. \n\nThe common stock portion of the performance share awards is considered an equity award and is valued based on Exelon's stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the performance share awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon&#8217;s current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon&#8217;s stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder return modifier and expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established. \n\nFor nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the straight-line method. For performance share awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant. \n\nExelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period. \n\nThe following table summarizes Exelon&#8217;s nonvested performance share awards activity: \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 20 &#8212; Stock-Based Compensation Plans \n\n##TABLE_START Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share) \n\nNonvested at December 31, 2021 (a) \n\n1,222,516 &#160; $ 44.96 &#160; Granted 727,697 &#160; 43.05 &#160; Change in performance ( 216,981 ) 42.73 &#160; Vested ( 233,318 ) 47.39 &#160; Forfeited ( 86,128 ) 42.61 &#160; Awards surrendered as a result of the separation ( 2,308,745 ) Awards granted in conversion as a result of the separation 1,870,990 &#160; \n\nUndistributed vested awards (b)(c) \n\n( 109,226 ) 4.55 &#160; \n\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 (a) \n\n866,805 &#160; $ 41.86 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Excludes 1,539,819 and 1,934,238 of performance share awards issued to retirement-eligible employees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as they are fully vested. \n\n(b) The significant reduction in weighted average grant date fair value during 2022 primarily resulted from more pre-separation shares being surrendered than shares issued to Exelon retirement eligible employees post-separation. \n\n(c) Represents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2022. \n\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of performance share awards vested. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 (a) \n\n2021 2020 Weighted average grant date fair value (per share) $ 43.05 &#160; $ 43.37 &#160; $ 46.61 &#160; Total fair value of performance shares vested 29 &#160; 44 &#160; 39 &#160; Total fair value of performance shares settled in cash 25 &#160; 28 &#160; 63 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) As of December 31, 2022, $ 12 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.8 years. \n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nRestricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued. \n\nThe value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to five years . However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized ratably over the first six months in the year of grant if the employee reaches retirement eligibility prior to July 1st of the grant year or through the date of which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period. \n\nThe following table summarizes Exelon&#8217;s nonvested restricted stock unit activity: \n\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted) \n\nNote 20 &#8212; Stock-Based Compensation Plans \n\n##TABLE_START Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share) \n\nNonvested at December 31, 2021 (a) \n\n1,142,049 &#160; $ 43.52 &#160; Granted 468,514 &#160; 42.97 &#160; Vested ( 499,621 ) 42.28 &#160; Forfeited ( 71,816 ) 41.89 &#160; Awards surrendered as a result of the separation ( 943,509 ) Awards granted in conversion as a result of the separation 643,994 \n\nUndistributed vested awards (b) \n\n( 178,450 ) 38.24 &#160; \n\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 (a) \n\n561,161 $ 41.98 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) Excludes 476,592 and 609,934 of restricted stock units issued to retirement-eligible employees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as they are fully vested. \n\n(b) Represents restricted stock units that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2022. \n\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of restricted stock units vested. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 (a) \n\n2021 2020 Weighted average grant date fair value (per share) $ 42.97 &#160; $ 44.21 &#160; $ 46.33 &#160; Total fair value of restricted stock units vested 23 &#160; 34 &#160; 54 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n__________ \n\n(a) As of December 31, 2022, $ 11 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.90 years. \n\nStock Options \n\nNon-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Exelon&#8217;s common stock were granted through 2012 under the LTIP.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END\n\nAll Registrants&#8212;Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, each of the Registrant's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting of information in that Registrant&#8217;s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by the Registrants to ensure that (a) material information relating to that Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to that Registrant&#8217;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that Registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people. \n\nAccordingly, as of December 31, 2022, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of the Registrants concluded that such Registrant&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish its objectives. \n\nAll Registrants&#8212;Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nEach Registrant continually strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Executive Overview for additional information on COVID-19. \n\nAll Registrants&#8212;Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022 and, therefore, concluded that each Registrant&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. \n\n##TABLE_START "

\n\nSchedule I &#8211; Condensed Financial Information of Parent (Exelon Corporate) \n\n&#160; Notes to Financial Statements \n\n1. Basis of Presentation \n\nExelon Corporate is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries. These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Rule 12-04, Schedule I of Regulation S-X. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, of Exelon Corporation. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Exelon Corporate owned 100 % of all of its significant subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd), of which Exelon Corporate owns more than 99 %. As of February 1, 2022, as a result of the completion of the separation, Exelon Corporate no longer retains any equity ownership interest in Generation or Constellation. The separation of Constellation, including Generation and its subsidiaries, meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. Accounting rules require that certain BSC costs previously allocated to Generation be presented as part of Exelon&#8217;s continuing operations as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations. Comprehensive income and cash flows related to Generation have not been segregated and are included in the Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and Condensed Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, for all periods presented. See Note 2 &#8212; Discontinued Operations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n2.

All indebtedness pursuant to the loan agreement was unsecured. On August 11, 2022, Exelon Corporate made a partial repayment of $ 575 million on the term loan.
