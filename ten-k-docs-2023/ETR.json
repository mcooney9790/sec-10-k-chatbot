Business \n\nRISK FACTORS SUMMARY \n\nEntergy&#8217;s business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could affect its ability to successfully implement its business strategy and affect its financial results. Carefully consider all of the information in this report and, in particular, the following principal risks and all of the other specific factors described in Item 1A. of this report, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; before deciding whether to invest in Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries. \n\nUtility Regulatory Risks \n\n&#8226; The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal, potentially resulting in lengthy litigation, and uncertainty as to ultimate results. \n\n&#8226; Entergy&#8217;s business could experience adverse effects related to changes to state or federal legislation or regulation. \n\n&#8226; The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. \n\n&#8226; The Utility operating companies are subject to risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. \n\n&#8226; The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\n&#8226; A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and its Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. \n\n&#8226; Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations. \n\nNuclear Operating, Shutdown, and Regulatory Risks \n\n&#8226; The results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy could be materially affected by the following: \n\n&#9702; inability to consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors; \n\n&#9702; refueling outages that last materially longer than anticipated or unplanned outages; \n\n&#9702; risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication); \n\n&#9702; the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants; \n\n&#9702; risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants; \n\n&#9702; the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants; \n\n&#9702; the potential requirement to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act and/or by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance; \n\n&#9702; the risk that the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts; and \n\n&#9702; new or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel. \n\nGeneral Business Risks \n\n&#8226; Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\n&#8226; A downgrade in Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; credit ratings could, among other things, negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ability to access capital and the cost of such capital. \n\n&#8226; Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability to meet their stated goals or commitments, among other potential causes. \n\n&#8226; Changes in tax legislation and taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\n&#8226; Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete capital projects, other capital improvements, and strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies. \n\n&#8226; Failure to attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Entergy and Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, may incur substantial costs (i) to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters or (ii) related to reliability standards. \n\n&#8226; Entergy could be negatively affected by the effects of climate change, including physical risks, such as increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other severe weather, and transition risks, such as environmental and regulatory obligations intended to combat the effects of climate change, including by compelling greenhouse gas emission reductions or reporting, or increasing clean or renewable energy requirements, or placing a price on greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n&#8226; Entergy and its subsidiaries are dependent on the continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses. \n\n&#8226; Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices. \n\n&#8226; The Utility operating companies and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations. \n\n&#8226; Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. \n\n&#8226; The litigation environment in the states in which the Registrant Subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. \n\n&#8226; Terrorist attacks, physical attacks, cyber attacks, system failures, or data breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; or their suppliers&#8217; physical infrastructure or technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs. \n\n&#8226; Significant increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\n&#8226; The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. \n\n&#8226; System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for all of its revenues. Certain contractual arrangements relating to System Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings. The aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the current net book value of System Energy. In the event of an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings requiring the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would be required to seek financing to pay such refunds, which financing may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required. If one or more of the foregoing events occurs, System Energy may be required to explore other options or protections available to it to extend, restructure, or retire its indebtedness and to prioritize its obligations. \n\n&#8226; Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory, or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. \n\n&#8226; As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock, and has provided, and may continue to provide, capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries, which would reduce the funds available to meet its other financial obligations. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nENTERGY&#8217;S BUSINESS \n\nEntergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 24,000 MW of electric generating capacity, including approximately 5,000 MW of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 3 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy had annual revenues of $13.8 billion in 2022 and had approximately 12,000 employees as of December 31, 2022. \n\nEntergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. \n\n&#8226; The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a small natural gas distribution business. \n\n&#8226; The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. See &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; for discussion of the shutdown and sale of each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. With the sale of Palisades in June 2022, Entergy completed its multi-year strategy to exit the merchant nuclear power business. Upon completion of all transition activities, effective January 1, 2023, Entergy Wholesale Commodities is no longer a reportable business segment. \n\nSee Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding Entergy&#8217;s business segments. \n\nStrategy \n\nEntergy&#8217;s strategy is to operate and grow its utility business, creating sustainable value for its customers, employees, communities, and owners. Entergy&#8217;s strategy to achieve its stakeholder objectives has a few key aspects. First, Entergy invests in the Utility for the benefit of its customers, which supports steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends. Second, Entergy manages risks by ensuring its Utility investments are customer-centric, supported by progressive regulatory constructs, and executed with disciplined project management. Third, Entergy is committed to delivering sustainable outcomes for all of its stakeholders by focusing on continually improving key elements of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), including reducing carbon emissions and improving resilience for Entergy and its customers. Entergy also executed the wind down of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant nuclear generation business, which was effectively complete by the end of 2022. \n\nUtility \n\nThe Utility business segment includes five retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas. These companies generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively. Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf. System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. The five retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council. System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale. The Utility has a diverse power generation portfolio, including increasingly carbon-free energy sources, which is consistent with Entergy&#8217;s strong support for the environment. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nCustomers \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Utility operating companies provided retail electric and gas service to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Electric Customers Gas Customers &#160; Area Served (In Thousands) (%) (In Thousands) (%) Entergy Arkansas Portions of Arkansas 730 24 % &#160; &#160; Entergy Louisiana Portions of Louisiana 1,101 37 % 95 47 % Entergy Mississippi Portions of Mississippi 461 15 % &#160; &#160; Entergy New Orleans City of New Orleans 211 7 % 109 53 % Entergy Texas Portions of Texas 499 17 % &#160; &#160; Total customers &#160; 3,002 100 % 204 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nElectric and Natural Gas Energy Sales \n\nElectric Energy Sales \n\nThe total electric energy sales of the Utility operating companies are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with the peak sales period normally occurring during the third quarter of each year. On June 24, 2022, Entergy reached a 2022 peak demand of 22,301 MWh, compared to the 2021 peak of 22,051 MWh recorded on August 23, 2021. Selected electric energy sales data for 2022 is shown in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Entergy Arkansas Entergy Louisiana Entergy Mississippi Entergy New Orleans Entergy Texas System Energy Entergy (a) &#160; (GWh) Sales to retail customers 22,473 57,532 13,038 5,706 21,380 &#8212; 120,129 Sales for resale: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Affiliates 1,906 5,416 &#8212; &#8212; 279 7,739 &#8212; Others 6,520 3,423 2,914 2,298 813 &#8212; 15,968 Total 30,899 66,371 15,952 8,004 22,472 7,739 136,097 Average use per residential customer (kWh) 13,478 14,874 14,791 12,818 15,444 &#8212; 14,479 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes the effect of intercompany eliminations. \n\nThe following table illustrates the Utility operating companies&#8217; 2022 combined electric sales volume as a percentage of total electric sales volume, and 2022 combined electric revenues as a percentage of total 2022 electric revenue, each by customer class. \n\n##TABLE_START Customer Class % of Sales Volume % of Revenue Residential 27.3 35.2 Commercial 20.6 23.4 Industrial (a) 38.6 28.2 Governmental 1.8 2.2 Wholesale/Other 11.7 11.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Major industrial customers are primarily in the petroleum refining and chemical industries. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nNatural Gas Energy Sales \n\nEntergy New Orleans and Entergy Louisiana provide both electric power and natural gas to retail customers. Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Louisiana sold 10,514,012 and 6,786,779 Mcf, respectively, of natural gas to retail customers in 2022. In 2022, 99% of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s operating revenue was derived from the electric utility business and only 1% from the natural gas distribution business. For Entergy New Orleans, 86% of operating revenue was derived from the electric utility business and 14% from the natural gas distribution business in 2022. \n\nFollowing is data concerning Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s 2022 retail operating revenue sources: \n\n##TABLE_START Customer Class % of Electric Operating Revenue % of Natural Gas Operating Revenue Residential 47 47 Commercial 36 26 Industrial 5 19 Governmental/Municipal 12 8 ##TABLE_END\n\nRetail Rate Regulation \n\nGeneral (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, System Energy) \n\nEach Utility operating company regularly participates in retail rate proceedings.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of ongoing proceedings at the FERC challenging System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on common equity and capital structure. \n\nEntergy Arkansas \n\nFormula Rate Plan \n\nBetween base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas is able to adjust base rates annually, subject to certain caps, through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year. Entergy Arkansas is subject to a maximum rate change \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nof 4% of the filing year total retail revenue. In addition, Entergy Arkansas is subject to a true-up of projection to actuals netted with future projection. In response to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. The initial five-year term expired in 2021. As granted by Arkansas law, Entergy Arkansas obtained APSC approval of the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five-year term, through 2026. If Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s formula rate plan were terminated, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. \n\nFuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased power costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In December 2007 the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing. \n\nProduction Cost Allocation Rider \n\nEntergy Arkansas has in place an APSC-approved production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of System Agreement proceedings. \n\nEntergy Louisiana \n\nFormula Rate Plan \n\nEntergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using a historic test year. The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013. The formula rate plan was most recently extended through the test year 2022; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease to the allowed return on equity, narrowing of the earnings &#8220;dead band&#8221; around the mid-point allowed return on equity, elimination of sharing above and below the earnings &#8220;dead band,&#8221; and the addition of a distribution cost recovery mechanism. The formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC, certain transmission investments, and most recently, certain distribution investments, among other items. In the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended or otherwise replaced, Entergy Louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment with a rate case filing occurring as soon as mid-2023. \n\nFuel Recovery \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs. The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings related to audits of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause filings. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nTo help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Louisiana historically hedged approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity was reviewed on an annual basis. In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to suspend these seasonal hedging programs and implement financial hedges with terms up to five years for a portion of its natural gas exposure, which was approved in November 2018. \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. \n\nRetail Rates - Gas \n\nIn accordance with the settlement of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012, in August 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal for implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated with strategic plant investment and relocation projects mandated by local governments. After review by the LPSC staff and inclusion of certain customer safeguards required by the LPSC staff, in December 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint settlement for implementation of an accelerated gas pipe replacement program providing for the replacement of approximately 100 miles of pipe over the next ten years, as well as relocation of certain existing pipe resulting from local government-related infrastructure projects, and for a rider to recover the investment associated with these projects. The rider allows for recovery of approximately $65 million over ten years. The rider recovery will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to include actual investment incurred for the prior quarter and is subject to the following conditions, among others: a ten-year term; application of any earnings in excess of the upper end of the earnings band as an offset to the revenue requirement of the infrastructure rider; adherence to a specified spending plan, within plus or minus 20% annually; annual filings comparing actual versus planned rider spending with actual spending and explanation of variances exceeding 10%; and an annual true-up. The joint settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2015. Implementation of the infrastructure rider commenced with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April 2015. In April 2022 Entergy Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal to extend the infrastructure rider to address replacement of an additional 187 miles of pipe. In December 2022 Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted an uncontested settlement that extends the rider for an additional ten years beginning after the end of the current term of the rider in 2025. The extension is subject to the same customer safeguards and conditions as the original term of the rider. The extension allows for recovery of approximately $95 million over ten years. In February 2023, the uncontested settlement was approved by the LPSC. \n\nStorm Cost Recovery \n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s filings to recover storm-related costs. \n\nOther \n\nIn March 2016 the LPSC opened two dockets to examine, on a generic basis, issues that it identified in connection with its review of Cleco Corporation&#8217;s acquisition by third party investors. The first docket is captioned &#8220;In re: Investigation of double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities,&#8221; and the second is captioned &#8220;In re: Investigation of tax structure issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities.&#8221; In April 2016 the LPSC clarified that the concerns giving rise to the two dockets arose as a result of its review of the structure of the Cleco-Macquarie transaction and that the specific intent of the directives is to seek more information regarding intra-corporate debt financing of a utility&#8217;s capital structure as well as the use of investment tax credits to mitigate the tax \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nobligation at the parent level of a consolidated entity. No schedule has been set for either docket, and limited discovery has occurred. \n\nIn December 2019 an LPSC commissioner issued an unopposed directive to staff to research customer-centered options for all customer classes, as well as other regulatory environments, and recommend a plan for how to ensure customers are the focus. There was no opposition to the directive from other commissioners but several remarked that the intent of the directive was not initiated to pursue retail open access. In furtherance of the directive, the LPSC issued a notice of the opening of a docket to conduct a rulemaking to research and evaluate customer-centered options for all electric customer classes as well as other regulatory environments in January 2020. To date, the LPSC staff has requested multiple rounds of comments from stakeholders and conducted one technical conference. Topics on which comments have been filed include full and limited retail access, demand response, sleeved power purchase agreements, and energy efficiency. Neither the LPSC or the LPSC staff have made recommendations or adopted any rules. \n\nEntergy Mississippi \n\nFormula Rate Plan \n\nSince the conclusion in 2015 of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s most recent base rate case, Entergy Mississippi has set electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan. Between base rate cases, Entergy Mississippi is able to adjust base rates annually, subject to certain caps, through formula rate plans that utilize forward-looking features. In addition, Entergy Mississippi is subject to an annual &#8220;look-back&#8221; evaluation. Entergy Mississippi is allowed a maximum rate increase of 4% of each test year&#8217;s retail revenue. Any increase above 4% requires a base rate case. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan were terminated without replacement, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. \n\nIn August 2012 the MPSC opened inquiries to review whether the then current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan and Mississippi Power Company&#8217;s annual formula rate plan was still appropriate or could be improved to better serve the public interest. The intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan proceeding. In March 2013 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed its consultant&#8217;s report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. The report suggested ways in which the methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time. In June 2014 the MPSC expanded the scope of the August 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans. The MPSC directed the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to investigate and review Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan rider schedule and Mississippi Power Company&#8217;s Performance Evaluation Plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies. No procedural schedule has been set. In October 2014 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities&#8217; formula rate plans. The docket remains open. \n\nIn December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for a mechanism in the formula rate plan, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi as well as to allow similar cost recovery treatment for other capacity acquisitions that are approved by the MPSC. The MPSC must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each new resource. In addition, the MPSC approved revisions to the formula rate plan which allows Entergy Mississippi to begin billing rate adjustments effective April \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\n1 of the filing year on a temporary basis subject to refund or credit to customers, subject to final MPSC order. The MPSC also authorized Entergy Mississippi to remove vegetation management costs from the formula rate plan and recover these costs through the establishment of a vegetation management rider. \n\nFuel Recovery \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The energy cost rate for each calendar year is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy costs as of the 12-month period ended September 30. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. The energy cost recovery riders allow interim rate adjustments depending on the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. \n\nTo help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. \n\nStorm Cost Recovery \n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of recovery of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s storm-related costs. \n\nEntergy New Orleans \n\nFormula Rate Plan \n\nAs part of its determination of rates in the base rate case filed by Entergy New Orleans in 2018, in November 2019, the City Council issued a resolution resolving the rate case, with rates to become effective retroactive to August 2019. The resolution allows Entergy New Orleans to implement a three-year formula rate plan, beginning with the 2019 test year as adjusted for forward-looking known and measurable changes, with the filing for the first test year to be made in 2020. As part of a settlement of Entergy New Orleans&#8217; appeal of the Council&#8217;s decision in its 2018 base rate case, Entergy New Orleans agreed to postpone the filing of its first test year formula rate plan to 2021 and, in return, to be provided an additional test year for the three-year cycle. Accordingly, Entergy New Orleans will submit its final formula rate plan filing of the three-year cycle in April 2023 unless the formula rate plan is extended or renewed. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. \n\nFuel Recovery \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. \n\nTo help stabilize gas costs, Entergy New Orleans seeks approval annually from the City Council to continue implementation of its natural gas hedging program consistent with the City Council&#8217;s stated policy objectives. The program uses financial instruments to hedge exposure to volatility in the wholesale price of natural gas purchased to \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nserve Entergy New Orleans gas customers. Entergy New Orleans hedges up to 25% of actual gas sales made during the winter months. \n\nStorm Cost Recovery \n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s filings to recover storm-related costs. \n\nEntergy Texas \n\nBase Rates \n\nThe base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings. Between base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs. Entergy Texas is required to file full base rate case proceedings every four years and within eighteen months of utilizing its generation cost recovery rider for investments above $200 million. \n\nFuel Recovery \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, that are not included in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas&#8217;s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT every three years, at a minimum. In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts entered into during the reconciliation period. The PUCT fuel cost proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. \n\nAt the PUCT&#8217;s April 2013 open meeting, the PUCT Commissioners discussed their view that a purchased power capacity rider was good public policy. The PUCT issued an order in May 2013 adopting the rule allowing for a purchased power capacity rider, subject to an offsetting adjustment for load growth. The rule, as adopted, also includes a process for obtaining pre-approval by the PUCT of purchased power agreements. No Texas utility, including Entergy Texas, has exercised the option to recover capacity costs under the new rider mechanism, but Entergy Texas will continue to evaluate the benefits of utilizing the rider to recover future capacity costs. \n\nOther Cost Recovery \n\nAs discussed above, Entergy Texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs. These riders include a transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism for the recovery of transmission-related capital investments, a distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism for the recovery of distribution-related capital investment, and a generation cost recovery rider mechanism for the recovery of generation-related capital investments. \n\nIn June 2009 a law was enacted in Texas containing provisions that allow Entergy Texas to take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas. \n\nIn September 2011 the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a distribution cost recovery factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure. The distribution cost recovery factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase or decrease in rates above or below amounts reflected in base rates to reflect distribution-related depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\ninvestment. The distribution cost recovery factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases. \n\nIn September 2019 the PUCT initiated a rulemaking to promulgate a generation cost recovery rider rule, implementing legislation passed in the 2019 Texas legislative session intended to allow electric utilities to recover generation investments between base rate proceedings. The PUCT approved the final rule in July 2020. \n\nStorm Cost Recovery \n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Texas&#8217;s filings to recover storm-related costs. \n\nElectric Industry Restructuring \n\nIn June 2009 a law was enacted in Texas that required Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas&#8217;s transition to competition. The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist. Under the law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT&#8217;s certification of a qualified power region for Entergy Texas. \n\nThe law further amended already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the law provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall &#8220;purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer;&#8221; and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service. The law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction. The PUCT determined that unrecovered costs that may be recovered through the rider consist only of those costs necessary to implement and administer the competitive generation program and do not include lost revenues or embedded generation costs. The amount of customer load that may be included in the competitive generation service program is limited to 115 MW. \n\nSystem Energy \n\nCost of Service \n\nThe rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which has monthly billings that reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, Grand Gulf. Retail regulators and other parties may seek to initiate proceedings at FERC to investigate the prudence of costs included in the rates charged under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures, allowed rates of return and rate base, and previously incurred capital expenditures. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, and a separate proceeding for a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In addition, certain of the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators have filed a complaint at FERC challenging the 2012 extended power uprate of Grand Gulf and the operation and management of the plant, particularly during the time period 2016 - 2020. Beginning in 2021, System Energy implemented billing protocols to provide retail regulators with \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\ninformation regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Entergy cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings, and an adverse outcome in any of them could have a material adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. \n\nFranchises \n\nEntergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 308 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas. These franchises generally are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property. In Arkansas, franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are governed pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes. \n\nEntergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 175 incorporated municipalities and in the unincorporated areas of approximately 59 parishes of Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide natural gas service to customers in the City of Baton Rouge and in East Baton Rouge Parish. Municipal franchise agreement terms range from 25 to 60 years while parish franchise terms range from 25 to 99 years. \n\nEntergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi. Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive. Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence. \n\nEntergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances. These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric and gas utility properties. \n\nEntergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 70 incorporated municipalities. Entergy Texas typically obtains 25-year franchise agreements as existing agreements expire. Entergy Texas&#8217;s electric franchises expire over the period 2023-2058. \n\nThe business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales. It has no distribution franchises. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nProperty and Other Generation Resources \n\nOwned Generating Stations \n\nThe total capability of the generating stations owned and leased by the Utility operating companies and System Energy as of December 31, 2022 is indicated below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Owned and Leased Capability MW(a) Company Total CT / CCGT (b) Legacy Gas/Oil Nuclear Coal Hydro Solar Entergy Arkansas 5,276 1,567 522 1,822 1,192 73 100 Entergy Louisiana 10,829 5,595 2,766 2,129 339 &#8212; &#8212; Entergy Mississippi 2,857 1,738 707 &#8212; 310 &#8212; 102 Entergy New Orleans 663 636 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 27 Entergy Texas 3,190 980 1,960 &#8212; 250 &#8212; &#8212; System Energy 1,260 &#8212; &#8212; 1,260 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total 24,075 10,516 5,955 5,211 2,091 73 229 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) &#8220;Owned and Leased Capability&#8221; is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize. \n\n(b) Represents Simple Cycle Combustion Turbine units and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine units. \n\nSummer peak load for the Utility has averaged 21,602 MW over the previous decade. \n\nThe Utility operating companies&#8217; load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections. These reviews consider existing and projected demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, the economy, Entergy&#8217;s clean energy and other public policy goals, environmental regulations, and the age and condition of Entergy&#8217;s existing infrastructure. \n\nThe Utility operating companies&#8217; long-term resource strategy (Portfolio Transformation Strategy) calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted. Over the past decade, the Portfolio Transformation Strategy has resulted in the addition of about 8,975 MW of new long-term resources and the deactivation of about 4,881 MW of legacy generation. As MISO market participants, the Utility operating companies also participate in MISO&#8217;s Day Ahead and Real Time Energy and Ancillary Services markets to economically dispatch generation and purchase energy to serve customers reliably and at the lowest reasonable cost. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nOther Generation Resources \n\nRFP Procurements \n\nThe Utility operating companies from time to time issue requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies. The RFPs issued by the Utility operating companies have sought resources needed to meet near-term MISO reliability requirements as well as long-term requirements through a broad range of wholesale power products, including long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions. The RFP process has resulted in selections or acquisitions, including, among other things: \n\n&#8226; Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s construction of the 980 MW, combined-cycle, gas turbine J. Wayne Leonard Power Station (previously referred to as the St. Charles generating facility) at its existing Little Gypsy electric generating station. The facility began commercial operation in May 2019; \n\n&#8226; Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s construction of the 994 MW, combined-cycle, gas turbine Lake Charles generating facility at its existing Nelson electric generating station site.

The RFP is seeking up to 1000 MW through a combination of build-own-transfer agreements, self-build alternatives, and power purchase agreements that can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity, and other benefits to Entergy Arkansas customers. \n\nIn October 2022, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Texas, issued an RFP for solar photovoltaic and wind resources. The RFP is seeking up to 2000 MW through a combination of build-own-transfer agreements, self-build alternatives, and power purchase agreements that can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity, and other benefits to Entergy Texas customers. \n\nIn November 2022, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Mississippi, issued an RFP for solar photovoltaic and wind resources. The RFP is seeking up to 500 MW through a combination of build-own-transfer agreements, self-build alternatives, and power purchase agreements that can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity, and other benefits to Entergy Mississippi customers. \n\nOther Procurements From Third Parties \n\nThe Utility operating companies have also made resource acquisitions outside of the RFP process, including Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s (Power Block 2), Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s (Power Blocks 3 and 4), and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s (Power Block 1) March 2016 acquisitions of the 1,980 MW (summer rating), natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine Union Power Station power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating); and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s October 2019 acquisition of the 810 MW, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired Choctaw Generating Station. The \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nUtility operating companies have also entered into various limited- and long-term contracts in recent years as a result of bilateral negotiations. \n\nThe Washington Parish Energy Center is a 361 MW natural gas-fired peaking power plant approximately 60 miles north of New Orleans on a site Entergy Louisiana purchased from Calpine in 2019. In May 2018, Entergy Louisiana received LPSC approval of its certification application for this simple-cycle power plant to be developed pursuant to an agreement between Calpine and Entergy Louisiana. Calpine began construction on the plant in early 2019 and Entergy Louisiana purchased the plant upon completion in November 2020. \n\nThe Hardin County Peaking Facility, an existing 147 MW simple-cycle gas-fired peaking power plant in Kountze, Texas, previously owned by East Texas Electric Cooperative, was acquired by Entergy Texas in June 2021. The facility has been in operation since January 2010. \n\nPower Through Programs \n\nIn December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to amend its certificate of convenience and necessity to own and operate up to 75 MW of natural gas-fired distributed generation to be installed at commercial and industrial customer premises. Under this proposal, Entergy Texas would own and operate a fleet of generators ranging from 100 kW to 10 MW that would supply a portion of Entergy Texas&#8217;s long-term resource needs and enhance the resiliency of Entergy Texas&#8217;s electric grid. This fleet of generators would also be available to customers during outages to supply backup electric service as part of a program known as &#8220;Power Through.&#8221; In its 2021 session, the Texas legislature modified the Texas Utilities Code to exempt generators under 10 megawatts from the requirement to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity. In addition, the PUCT announced an intent to conduct a broad rulemaking related to distributed generation and recommended that utilities with pending applications addressing distributed generation withdraw them. Accordingly, Entergy Texas withdrew its application for a certificate of convenience and necessity and associated tariff from the PUCT without prejudice to refiling. Entergy Texas continues to deploy certain customer-sited distributed generators under an existing PUCT-approved tariff. In August 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application for PUCT approval of voluntary Rate Schedule Utility Owned Distributed Generation (UODG) through which it would charge host customers for back-up service from customer-sited Power Through generators. Based on the exemption enacted by the Texas legislature in 2021, Entergy Texas&#8217;s application was not required to, and did not, seek an amendment to its certificate of convenience and necessity in order to continue deploying Power Through generators. In October 2022 two intervenors filed requests for a hearing on Entergy Texas&#8217;s application. In October 2022 the PUCT staff filed a request that the proceeding be referred to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. In January 2023 the PUCT announced an intent to develop certain broadly applicable reliability metrics against which to measure distributed generation resources and directed Entergy Texas to withdraw its application. However, the PUCT did allow Entergy Texas to continue its pilot program for Power Through generators. Entergy Texas has withdrawn its application and is considering next steps. \n\nIn August 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an application for authority to deploy natural gas-fired distributed generation. The application was supported by a number of letters of interest from Entergy Arkansas customers. In December 2021 the APSC general staff requested briefing, which Entergy Arkansas opposed. In January 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed to support the establishment of a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2022. Also in January 2022, the APSC granted the general staff&#8217;s request for briefing but on an expedited schedule; briefing concluded in February 2022. Based on testimony filed to date the APSC general staff, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Sierra Club, and Audubon oppose Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s proposed &#8220;Power Through&#8221; offering, which has been demonstrated to be in high demand by interested customers, some of which directly have filed public comments encouraging the APSC to approve the application. A paper hearing was held in August and September 2022 with Entergy Arkansas responding to several written commissioner questions. The parties are awaiting a decision from the APSC. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nIn July 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application for authority to deploy natural gas-fired distributed generation. The application was supported by a number of letters of interest from Entergy Louisiana customers. In October 2021, a procedural schedule was established with a hearing in April 2022. Staff and certain intervenors filed direct testimony in December 2021, and cross-answering testimony was filed in January 2022. Entergy Louisiana filed rebuttal testimony in February 2022. The parties reached an uncontested settlement which, among other things, recommended approval of 120 MW of natural gas fired distributed generation and an additional 30 MW of solar and battery distributed generation, for a total distributed generation program of 150 MW. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana may seek to expand the distributed generation program following the earlier of two years after issuance of an order approving the settlement or the installation of 60 MW of distributed generation pursuant to this program. The settlement was approved by the LPSC in November 2022. \n\nInterconnections \n\nThe Utility operating companies&#8217; generating units are interconnected to a transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV. These generating units consist of steam-turbine generators fueled by natural gas and coal, combustion-turbine generators, and reciprocating internal combustion engine generators that are fueled by natural gas, generators powered by pressurized and boiling water nuclear reactors and inverter-based resources interconnecting both solar photovoltaic systems and energy storage devices that operate in the MISO wholesale electric market. Additionally, some of the Utility operating companies also offer customer services and products that include resources interconnected to both the distribution and transmission systems that also participate in the wholesale market. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies are MISO market participants and the companies&#8217; transmission systems are interconnected with those of many neighboring utilities. MISO is an essential link in the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), the Regional Entity with delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing Bulk Electric System reliability standards within 16 central and southeastern states. \n\nGas Property \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within New Orleans, Louisiana, through approximately 2,600 miles of gas pipeline. As of December 31, 2022, the gas properties of Entergy Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial position. \n\nTitle \n\nThe Utility operating companies&#8217; generating stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple. Most of the substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises. Some substation properties are owned in fee simple. The Utility operating companies generally have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations. \n\nSubstantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by those companies. The Lewis Creek generating station of Entergy Texas was acquired by merger with a subsidiary of Entergy Texas and is currently not subject to the lien of the Entergy Texas indenture. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nFuel Supply \n\nThe average fuel cost per kWh for the Utility operating companies and System Energy for the years 2020-2022 were: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Natural Gas Nuclear Coal Renewables (a) Purchased Power MISO Purchases (b) 2022 (Cents Per kWh) Entergy Arkansas 4.98 0.52 2.93 2.11 10.90 (2.65) Entergy Louisiana 5.50 0.57 2.84 10.70 6.95 6.45 Entergy Mississippi 4.38 &#8212; 2.85 0.04 6.53 6.68 Entergy New Orleans (c) 5.10 &#8212; &#8212; (5.16) &#8212; 7.21 Entergy Texas 5.77 &#8212; 2.83 6.26 5.61 6.68 System Energy &#8212; 0.65 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Utility 5.27 0.57 2.89 7.00 6.54 5.95 2021 Entergy Arkansas 4.11 0.56 2.43 2.85 2.53 3.87 Entergy Louisiana 3.77 0.56 2.62 10.87 5.52 4.04 Entergy Mississippi 2.71 &#8212; 2.53 1.22 2.70 4.16 Entergy New Orleans (c) 3.47 &#8212; &#8212; (2.82) &#8212; 4.50 Entergy Texas 4.65 &#8212; 2.60 3.97 4.53 4.10 System Energy &#8212; 0.55 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Utility 3.75 0.56 2.48 9.07 4.76 4.08 2020 Entergy Arkansas 1.78 0.62 2.35 2.28 7.39 0.63 Entergy Louisiana 1.98 0.58 3.27 9.99 3.48 2.65 Entergy Mississippi 1.73 &#8212; 2.52 0.25 3.23 2.26 Entergy New Orleans 1.56 &#8212; &#8212; 0.02 &#8212; 2.99 Entergy Texas 2.23 &#8212; 3.17 3.61 3.29 2.71 System Energy &#8212; 0.39 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Utility 1.92 0.57 2.54 8.28 3.35 2.48 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes average fuel costs from both owned and purchased power resources. \n\n(b) Includes activity from financial transmission rights.

Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. \n\n(b) Represents natural gas sourced for Simple Cycle Combustion Turbine units and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine units. \n\n(c) Includes generation from both owned and purchased power resources. \n\n(d) Excludes MISO purchases and renewables purchased through purchased power agreements. \n\n(e) In December 2013, Entergy integrated its transmission system into the MISO RTO. Entergy offers all of its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the MISO energy market to serve the demand of its customers, with MISO making dispatch decisions. The MISO purchases metric provided for 2022 is not projected for 2023. \n\nSome of the Utility&#8217;s gas-fired plants are also capable of using fuel oil, if necessary. Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect fuel oil use in 2023, it is possible that various operational events including weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil. \n\nNatural Gas \n\nThe Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation. Over 50% of the Utility operating companies&#8217; power plants maintain some level of long-term firm transportation. Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nEntergy Texas owns a gas storage facility and Entergy Louisiana has a firm storage service agreement that provide reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations. \n\nMany factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage, pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants. Demand is primarily tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources. Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage. To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies may in some instances use alternate fuels, such as oil when available, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power. \n\nCoal \n\nEntergy Arkansas has committed to six two- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 85% of the total coal supply needs in 2023. These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year. If needed, additional Powder River Basin (PRB) coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs. Based on the high cost of alternate sources, modes of transportation, and infrastructure improvements necessary for its delivery, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2023. Coal will be transported to Arkansas via an existing Union Pacific transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s rail transportation requirements for 2023. \n\nEntergy Louisiana has committed to four two- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2023. If needed, additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs. For the same reasons as the Entergy Arkansas plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2023. Coal will be transported to Nelson via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s rail transportation requirements for 2023. \n\nCoal transportation delivery rates to Entergy Arkansas- and Entergy Louisiana-operated coal-fired units became constrained and were unable to fully meet supply needs and obligations beginning in August 2021. Deliveries remained constrained through 2022 with modest improvement expected later in 2023. Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana control enough railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement. \n\nThe operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of PRB coal requested for 2023, but is also currently experiencing delivery constraints. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy Texas&#8217;s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis. \n\nNuclear Fuel \n\nThe nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following: \n\n&#8226; mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate; \n\n&#8226; conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas; \n\n&#8226; enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas; \n\n&#8226; fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors; and \n\n&#8226; disposal of spent fuel. \n\nThe Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy&#8217;s Utility nuclear units. These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nuranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company. Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis. The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of processing. The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool. Entergy Operations, Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and the owner of a nuclear power plant. \n\nBased upon currently planned fuel cycles, the Utility nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2027. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners, including their ability to work through supply disruptions caused by global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or national events, such as political disruption. There are a number of possible supply alternatives that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy&#8217;s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery. \n\nThe effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. There are fewer of these providers than for uranium. For conversion and enrichment services, like uranium, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures as needed to ensure supply of enriched uranium for the reliable fabrication of nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the effective performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel, therefore, Entergy provides additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight for the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services. The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes. These credit facilities are subject to periodic renewal, and the notes are issued periodically, typically for terms between three and seven years. \n\nNatural Gas Purchased for Resale \n\nEntergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas. Its system is interconnected with one interstate and three intrastate pipelines. Entergy New Orleans has a &#8220;no-notice&#8221; service gas purchase contract with Symmetry Energy Solutions which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts. The Symmetry Energy Solutions gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co. This service is subject to FERC-approved rates. Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases. \n\nEntergy Louisiana purchased natural gas for resale in 2022 under a firm contract from Sequent Energy Management L.P. The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nAs a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s or Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints. \n\nFederal Regulation of the Utility \n\nState or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies. The FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity rates and interstate transmission of electricity, including System Energy&#8217;s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of federal regulation proceedings. \n\nTransmission and MISO Markets \n\nIn December 2013 the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. Although becoming a member of MISO did not affect the ownership by the Utility operating companies of their transmission facilities or the responsibility for maintaining those facilities, MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. MISO also exercises functional control of transmission planning and congestion management and provides schedules and pricing for the commitment and dispatch of generation that is offered into MISO&#8217;s markets, as well as pricing for load that bids into the markets. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. Each Utility operating company has its own transmission pricing zone and a formula rate template (included as Attachment O to the MISO tariff) used to establish transmission rates within MISO. The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the FERC. \n\nSystem Energy and Related Agreements \n\nSystem Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below). In 1998 the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations. Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of proceedings at the FERC related to System Energy. \n\nUnit Power Sales Agreement \n\nThe Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy&#8217;s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy&#8217;s only source of operating revenue. The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nIn the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf. Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates. In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s cost from its retained share. Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies, with the remainder of the retained share being sold to Entergy Mississippi through a separate life-of-resources purchased power agreement. In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted cost recovery with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions. Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs. Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC&#8217;s approval. Entergy Arkansas also has a life-of-resources purchased power agreement with Entergy Mississippi to sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s non-retained share of Grand Gulf. Entergy Mississippi was granted cost recovery for those purchases by the MPSC through its annual unit power cost rate mechanism. \n\nAvailability Agreement \n\nThe Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the original financing by System Energy of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy&#8217;s share of Grand Gulf. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy&#8217;s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges. \n\nThe allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%. The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of operating expense funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nSystem Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for all of its outstanding series of first mortgage bonds, as well as for its outstanding term loan and the pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued on its behalf. In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nEach of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured. \n\nThe obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals. Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale. No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval. \n\nSince commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement and, therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or certain of its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations. \n\nThe Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors. \n\nService Companies \n\nEntergy Services, a limited liability company wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies, but also provides services to Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively. Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an &#8220;at cost&#8221; basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC. \n\nJurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas \n\nEffective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Texas owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.&#8217;s 70% ownership interest in Nelson Unit 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nEntergy Texas purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend&#8217;s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant&#8217;s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the purchased power agreement. In connection with the termination of the System Agreement effective August 31, 2016, the purchased power agreements that were put in place for certain legacy units at the time of the jurisdictional separation were also terminated at that time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the purchased power agreements. \n\nEntergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination \n\nOn October 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by Entergy Louisiana (Old Entergy Louisiana) and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) were combined into a single public utility. In order to effect the business combination, under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Old Entergy Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (New Entergy Louisiana), and New Entergy Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Under the TXBOC, Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then merged into New Entergy Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger. Thereupon, Old Entergy Louisiana changed its name from &#8220;Entergy Louisiana, LLC&#8221; to &#8220;EL Investment Company, LLC&#8221; and New Entergy Louisiana changed its name from &#8220;Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC&#8221; to &#8220;Entergy Louisiana, LLC&#8221; (Entergy Louisiana). With the completion of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed the liabilities, of Old Entergy Louisiana and Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. \n\nEntergy New Orleans Internal Restructuring \n\nIn November 2017, pursuant to the agreement in principle, Entergy New Orleans, Inc. undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following: \n\n&#8226; Entergy New Orleans, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at a price of approximately $21 million, which included a call premium of approximately $819,000, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. \n\n&#8226; Entergy New Orleans, Inc. converted from a Louisiana corporation to a Texas corporation. \n\n&#8226; Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy New Orleans, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy New Orleans Power), and Entergy New Orleans Power assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy New Orleans, Inc. in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.

Entergy Arkansas, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Arkansas, Inc. The transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. \n\nEntergy Mississippi Internal Restructuring \n\nIn November 2018, Entergy Mississippi undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following: \n\n&#8226; Entergy Mississippi, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock, at the aggregate redemption price of approximately $21.2 million. \n\n&#8226; Entergy Mississippi, Inc. converted from a Mississippi corporation to a Texas corporation. \n\n&#8226; Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Mississippi, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Mississippi Power and Light), and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Mississippi, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Entergy Mississippi, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi Power and Light. \n\n&#8226; Entergy Mississippi, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi Power and Light to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation). As a result of the contribution, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC. \n\nIn December 2018, Entergy Mississippi, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Enterprises, Inc., and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light then changed its name to Entergy Mississippi, LLC. Entergy Mississippi, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Mississippi, Inc. The restructuring was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. \n\nEntergy Wholesale Commodities \n\nSee &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the shutdown and sale of each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. With the sale of Palisades in June 2022, Entergy completed its multi-year strategy to exit the merchant power business. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nEntergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership of interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides decommissioning-related services to nuclear power plants owned by non-affiliated entities in the United States. \n\nProperty \n\nEntergy Wholesale Commodities includes ownership in the following non-nuclear power plants: \n\n##TABLE_START Plant Location Ownership Net Owned Capacity (a) Type Independence Unit 2; 842 MW Newark, AR 14% 121 MW(b) Coal Nelson Unit 6; 550 MW Westlake, LA 11% 60 MW(b) Coal ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) &#8220;Net Owned Capacity&#8221; refers to the nameplate rating on the generating unit. \n\n(b) The owned MW capacity is the portion of the plant capacity owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For a complete listing of Entergy&#8217;s jointly-owned generating stations, refer to &#8220; Jointly-Owned Generating Stations &#8221; in Note 1 to the financial statements. \n\nAll of Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; owned generation falls under the authority of MISO. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; customers for the sale of both energy and capacity from its owned generation and its contracted power purchases include retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power generation companies. The majority of Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; owned generation and contracted power purchases are sold under cost-based contract. \n\nOther Business Activities \n\nTLG Services, a subsidiary in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment, offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners. \n\nRegulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business \n\nFederal Power Act \n\nThe Federal Power Act provides the FERC the authority to regulate: \n\n&#8226; the transmission and wholesale sale of electric energy in interstate commerce; \n\n&#8226; the reliability of the high voltage interstate transmission system through reliability standards; \n\n&#8226; sale or acquisition of certain assets; \n\n&#8226; securities issuances; \n\n&#8226; the licensing of certain hydroelectric projects; \n\n&#8226; certain other activities, including accounting policies and practices of electric and gas utilities; and \n\n&#8226; changes in control of FERC jurisdictional entities or rate schedules. \n\nThe Federal Power Act gives the FERC jurisdiction over the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf capacity and energy provided to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans and over the rates charged by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana to unaffiliated wholesale customers. The FERC also regulates wholesale power sales between the Utility operating companies. In addition, the FERC regulates the MISO RTO, an independent entity that maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy, capacity, and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. FERC regulation of the MISO RTO includes regulation of the design and implementation of the wholesale markets administered by the MISO RTO, as \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nwell as the rates, terms, and conditions of open access transmission service over the member systems and the allocation of costs associated with transmission upgrades. \n\nEntergy Arkansas holds a FERC license that expires in 2053 for two hydroelectric projects totaling 65 MW of capacity. \n\nState Regulation \n\nUtility \n\nEntergy Arkansas is subject to regulation by the APSC as to the following: \n\n&#8226; utility service; \n\n&#8226; utility service areas; \n\n&#8226; retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates; \n\n&#8226; fuel cost recovery, including audits of the energy cost recovery rider; \n\n&#8226; terms and conditions of service; \n\n&#8226; service standards; \n\n&#8226; the acquisition, sale, or lease of any public utility plant or property constituting an operating unit or system; \n\n&#8226; certificates of convenience and necessity and certificates of environmental compatibility and public need, as applicable, for generating and transmission facilities; \n\n&#8226; avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \n\n&#8226; net energy metering; \n\n&#8226; integrated resource planning; \n\n&#8226; utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control; and \n\n&#8226; the issuance and sale of certain securities. \n\nAdditionally, Entergy Arkansas serves a limited number of retail customers in Tennessee. Pursuant to legislation enacted in Tennessee, Entergy Arkansas is subject to complaints before the Tennessee Regulatory Authority only if it fails to treat its retail customers in Tennessee in the same manner as its retail customers in Arkansas. Additionally, Entergy Arkansas maintains limited facilities in Missouri but does not provide retail electric service to customers in Missouri. Although Entergy Arkansas obtained a certificate with respect to its Missouri facilities, Entergy Arkansas is not subject to retail ratemaking jurisdiction in Missouri. \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric and gas business is subject to regulation by the LPSC as to the following: \n\n&#8226; utility service; \n\n&#8226; retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates; \n\n&#8226; fuel cost recovery, including audits of the fuel adjustment clause, environmental adjustment charge, and purchased gas adjustment charge; \n\n&#8226; terms and conditions of service; \n\n&#8226; service standards; \n\n&#8226; certification of certain transmission projects; \n\n&#8226; certification of capacity acquisitions, both for owned capacity and for purchase power contracts that exceed either 5 MW or one year in term; \n\n&#8226; procurement process to acquire capacity over 50 MW; \n\n&#8226; audits of the energy efficiency rider; \n\n&#8226; avoided cost payment to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \n\n&#8226; integrated resource planning; \n\n&#8226; net energy metering; and \n\n&#8226; utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nEntergy Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MPSC as to the following: \n\n&#8226; utility service; \n\n&#8226; utility service areas; \n\n&#8226; retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates; \n\n&#8226; fuel cost recovery, including audits of the energy cost recovery mechanism; \n\n&#8226; terms and conditions of service; \n\n&#8226; service standards; \n\n&#8226; certification of generating facilities and certain transmission projects; \n\n&#8226; avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \n\n&#8226; integrated resource planning; \n\n&#8226; net energy metering; and \n\n&#8226; utility mergers, acquisitions, and other changes of control. \n\nEntergy Mississippi is also subject to regulation by the APSC as to the certificate of environmental compatibility and public need for the Independence Station, which is located in Arkansas. \n\nEntergy New Orleans is subject to regulation by the City Council as to the following: \n\n&#8226; utility service; \n\n&#8226; retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates; \n\n&#8226; fuel cost recovery, including audits of the fuel adjustment charge and purchased gas adjustment charge; \n\n&#8226; terms and conditions of service; \n\n&#8226; service standards; \n\n&#8226; audit of the environmental adjustment charge; \n\n&#8226; certification of the construction or extension of any new plant, equipment, property, or facility that comprises more than 2% of the utility&#8217;s rate base; \n\n&#8226; integrated resource planning; \n\n&#8226; net energy metering; \n\n&#8226; avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \n\n&#8226; issuance and sale of certain securities; and \n\n&#8226; utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control. \n\nTo the extent authorized by governing legislation, Entergy Texas is subject to the original jurisdiction of the municipal authorities of a number of incorporated cities in Texas with appellate jurisdiction over such matters residing in the PUCT. Entergy Texas is also subject to regulation by the PUCT as to the following: \n\n&#8226; retail rates and charges, including depreciation rates, and terms and conditions of service in unincorporated areas of its service territory, and in municipalities that have ceded jurisdiction to the PUCT; \n\n&#8226; fuel recovery, including reconciliations (audits) of the fuel adjustment charges; \n\n&#8226; service standards; \n\n&#8226; certification of certain transmission and generation projects; \n\n&#8226; utility service areas, including extensions into new areas; \n\n&#8226; avoided cost payments to non-exempt Qualifying Facilities; \n\n&#8226; net energy metering; and \n\n&#8226; utility mergers, sales/acquisitions/leases of plants over $10 million, sales of greater than 50% voting stock of utilities, and transfers of controlling interest in or operation of utilities. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nRegulation of the Nuclear Power Industry \n\nAtomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 \n\nUnder the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements. The NRC has broad authority to impose civil penalties or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend and Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. \n\nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 \n\nSpent Nuclear Fuel \n\nUnder the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors. Entergy&#8217;s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date. Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2022 of $195.0 million for the one-time fee. The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full recovery. Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense. Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants. Entergy&#8217;s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1.7 billion (exclusive of amounts relating to Entergy plants that were paid or are owed by prior owners of those plants). \n\nThe permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent fuel. Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts. The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation. Specific steps were taken to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project, including a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions. In August 2013 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to continue with the Yucca Mountain license review, but only to the extent of funds previously appropriated by Congress for that purpose and not yet used. Although the NRC completed the safety evaluation report for the license review in 2015, the previously appropriated funds are not sufficient to complete the review, including required hearings. The government has taken no effective action to date related to the recommendations of the appointed spent fuel study commission. Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy&#8217;s facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy&#8217;s nuclear sites. \n\nFollowing the defunding of the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued the government seeking cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983 fee. In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the fee to zero until the DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or Congress enacts an alternative waste disposal plan. In January 2014 the DOE submitted the \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nproposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit. The petition for rehearing was denied. The zero spent fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014. \n\nAs a result of the DOE&#8217;s failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages. These subsidiaries have been, and continue to be, involved in litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE&#8217;s delay in performance. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of final judgments recorded by Entergy in 2020, 2021, and 2022 related to Entergy&#8217;s nuclear owner licensee subsidiaries&#8217; litigation with the DOE. Through 2022, Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries have won and collected on judgments against the government totaling approximately $1 billion. \n\nPending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage. Storage capability additions using dry casks began operations at ANO in 1996, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, and at Waterford 3 in 2011. These facilities will be expanded as needed. \n\nNuclear Plant Decommissioning \n\nEntergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for ANO, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively. In addition, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation. The collections are deposited in trust funds that can only be used in accordance with NRC and other applicable regulatory requirements. Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning costs. \n\nIn December 2018 the APSC ordered collections in rates for decommissioning ANO 2 and found that ANO 1&#8217;s decommissioning was adequately funded without additional collections. In November 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a revised decommissioning cost recovery tariff for ANO indicating that both ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trusts were adequately funded without further collections, and in December 2021 the APSC ordered zero collections for ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning. In November 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a revised decommissioning cost recovery tariff for ANO indicating that ANO 1&#8217;s decommissioning trust was adequately funded, but that ANO 2&#8217;s fund had a projected shortage as a result of a decline in decommissioning trust fund investment values over the past year. The filing proposes a reinstatement of decommissioning cost recovery for ANO 2. Management cannot predict the outcome of this filing. \n\nIn July 2010 the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend to address previously identified funding shortfalls. This LPSC decision contemplated that the level of decommissioning collections could be revisited should the NRC grant license extensions for both Waterford 3 and River Bend. In July 2019, following the NRC approval of license extensions for Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking to adjust decommissioning and depreciation rates for those plants, including one proposed scenario that would adjust Louisiana-jurisdictional decommissioning collections to zero for both plants (including an offsetting increase in depreciation rates). Because of the ongoing public health emergency arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic uncertainty, Entergy Louisiana determined that the relief sought in the filing was no longer appropriate, and in November 2020, filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the proceeding. Following that filing, in a December 2020 order, the LPSC dismissed the proceeding without prejudice. In July 2021, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC to adjust Waterford 3 and River Bend decommissioning collections based on the latest site-specific decommissioning cost estimates for those plants. The filing seeks to increase Waterford 3 decommissioning collections and decrease River Bend decommissioning collections. The procedural schedule in the case has been suspended pending settlement negotiations. Management cannot predict the outcome of this filing. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nIn December 2010 the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for the Texas share of River Bend to address previously identified funding shortfalls. In December 2018 the PUCT approved a settlement that eliminated River Bend decommissioning collections for the Texas jurisdictional share of the plant based on a determination by Entergy Texas that the existing decommissioning fund was adequate following license renewal. In July 2022, Entergy Texas filed a rate case that proposed continuation of the cessation of River Bend decommissioning collections. In December 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a motion to abate the hearing on the merits to give parties additional time to finalize a settlement, which was approved by the presiding ALJ along with an order for the parties to file monthly settlement status reports. Management cannot predict the outcome of this filing. \n\nIn December 2016 the NRC issued a 20-year operating license renewal for Grand Gulf. In a 2017 filing at the FERC, System Energy stated that with the renewed operating license, Grand Gulf&#8217;s decommissioning trust was sufficiently funded, and proposed, among other things, to cease decommissioning collections for Grand Gulf effective October 1, 2017. The FERC accepted a settlement including the proposed decommissioning revenue requirement by letter order in August 2018. \n\nEntergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient for its nuclear plants subject to retail rate regulation, although decommissioning cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the adequacy of the funding amounts. \n\nPlant owners are required to provide the NRC with a biennial report (annually for units that have shut down or will shut down within five years), based on values as of December 31, addressing the owners&#8217; ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of the trust funds, plant owners may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. In March 2021 filings with the NRC were made reporting on decommissioning funding for all of Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries&#8217; nuclear plants. Those reports showed that decommissioning funding for each of the nuclear plants met the NRC&#8217;s financial assurance requirements. \n\nAdditional information with respect to Entergy&#8217;s decommissioning costs and decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 16 to the financial statements. \n\nPrice-Anderson Act \n\nThe Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase and maintain the maximum amount of nuclear liability insurance available and participate in an industry assessment program called Secondary Financial Protection in order to protect the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry. Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025. The Price-Anderson Act limits the contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to a maximum assessment of approximately $137.6 million per reactor (with 96 nuclear industry reactors currently participating). In the case of a nuclear event in which Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy is liable, protection is afforded through a combination of private insurance and the Secondary Financial Protection program. In addition to this, insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units is also purchased. The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements. \n\nNRC Reactor Oversight Process \n\nThe NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC&#8217;s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\neach plant in one of the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: &#8220;licensee response column,&#8221; or Column 1, &#8220;regulatory response column,&#8221; or Column 2, &#8220;degraded cornerstone column,&#8221; or Column 3, and &#8220;multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,&#8221; or Column 4, and &#8220;unacceptable performance,&#8221; or Column 5. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC. Continued plant operation is not permitted for plants in Column 5. All of the nuclear generating plants owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s Utility business are currently in Column 1, except Waterford 3, which is in Column 2. \n\nIn September 2022 the NRC placed Waterford 3 in Column 2 based on an error associated with a radiation monitor calibration. Entergy corrected the issue with the radiation monitor in February 2022; however, Waterford 3 is expected to remain in Column 2 until third quarter 2023 based on a subsequent radiation monitor calibration issue. \n\nEnvironmental Regulation \n\nEntergy&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy&#8217;s businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted below. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated. Except to the extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy&#8217;s businesses and is not expected to have a material effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. \n\nClean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments \n\nThe Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently or in the future may affect Entergy&#8217;s fossil-fueled generation facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other facilities. Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory requirements. These programs include: \n\n&#8226; new source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and significant modifications to existing facilities; \n\n&#8226; acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ); \n\n&#8226; nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants, which could include fee assessments for air pollutant emission sources under Section 185 of the Clean Air Act if attainment is not reached in a timely manner; \n\n&#8226; hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs; \n\n&#8226; Interstate Air Transport; \n\n&#8226; operating permit programs and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act programs; \n\n&#8226; Regional Haze programs; and \n\n&#8226; new and existing source standards for greenhouse gas and other air emissions. \n\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards \n\nThe Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, and requires periodic review of those standards. When an area fails to meet an ambient standard, it is considered to be in nonattainment and is classified as &#8220;marginal,&#8221; &#8220;moderate,&#8221; &#8220;serious,&#8221; or &#8220;severe.&#8221; When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable standards. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nOzone Nonattainment \n\nEntergy Texas operates two fossil-fueled generating facilities (Lewis Creek and Montgomery County Power Station) in a geographic area that is not in attainment with the applicable NAAQS for ozone. The ozone nonattainment area that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area. Both Lewis Creek and the Montgomery County Power Station hold all necessary permits for operation and comply with applicable air quality program regulations. Measures enacted to return the area to ozone attainment could make these program regulations more stringent. Entergy will continue to work with state environmental agencies on appropriate methods for assessing attainment and nonattainment with the ozone NAAQS. \n\nPotential SO 2 &#160; Nonattainment \n\nThe EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO 2 1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 parts per billion. In Entergy&#8217;s utility service territory, only St. Bernard Parish and Evangeline Parish in Louisiana are designated as nonattainment. In August 2017 the EPA issued a letter indicating that East Baton Rouge and St. Charles parishes would be designated by December 31, 2020, as monitors were installed to determine compliance. In March 2021 the EPA published a final rule designating East Baton Rouge, St. Charles, St. James, and West Baton Rouge parishes in Louisiana as attainment/unclassifiable, and, in Texas, Jefferson County as attainment/unclassifiable and Orange County as unclassifiable. No challenges to these final designations were filed within the 60 day deadline. Entergy continues to monitor this situation. \n\nHazardous Air Pollutants \n\nThe EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011, which had a compliance date, with a widely granted one-year extension, of April 2016. The required controls have been installed and are operational at all affected Entergy units. In May 2020 the EPA finalized a rule that finds that it is not &#8220;appropriate and necessary&#8221; to regulate hazardous air pollutants from electric steam generating units under the provisions of section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act. This is a reversal of the EPA&#8217;s previous finding requiring such regulation. The final appropriate and necessary finding does not revise the underlying MATS rule. Several lawsuits have been filed challenging the appropriate and necessary finding. In February 2021 the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA&#8217;s motion to hold the litigation in abeyance pending the agency&#8217;s review of the appropriate and necessary rule. In February 2022 the EPA issued a proposed rule revoking the 2020 rule and determining, again, that it is &#8220;appropriate and necessary&#8221; to regulate hazardous air pollutants. The EPA is seeking additional information, which it could use to further tighten the standard. Entergy will continue to monitor this situation. \n\nCross-State Air Pollution \n\nIn March 2005 the EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was intended to reduce SO 2 and NO x emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in twenty-nine eastern states. The rule required a combination of capital investment to install pollution control equipment and increased operating costs through the purchase of emission allowances. Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance procurement strategy. Based on several court challenges, CAIR and its subsequent versions, now known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), have been remanded to and modified by the EPA on multiple occasions. \n\nIn April 2022 the EPA published a rule to address interstate transport for the 2015 ozone NAAQS which will increase the stringency of the CSAPR program in all four of the states where the Utility operating companies operate. If finalized as proposed, the rule will significantly reduce emission allowances and would likely require the installation of post-combustion nitrogen oxides (NO x ) emissions controls on any coal or large legacy gas units that will operate beyond 2026 and are not currently equipped with such controls. Fifteen Entergy-owned units, totaling approximately 9,370 MW of total unit capacity, are identified by the EPA for selective catalytic reduction retrofits. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nBased on the EPA estimates, Entergy&#8217;s share of the capital costs would be approximately $1.6 billion if all the identified units were in fact retrofitted. Additionally, the EPA is proposing controls on certain non-electric generating NO x sources. Since releasing the proposed rule, the price for Group 3 NO x sources allowances has increased significantly, peaking at over $45,000 per allowance in late August 2022 before stabilizing in the range of $15,000 to $18,000 per allowance since September 2022. Comments on the proposed rule were due in June 2022. MISO, other impacted regional transmission organizations, and various state public service commissions all filed comments expressing reliability concerns if the rule is finalized as proposed. Entergy filed individual comments which assert, in addition to other issues, that the EPA&#8217;s proposal represents over-control of the Entergy units in Arkansas and Mississippi; the EPA should consider an alternative approach or provide flexibility for units with a limited remaining useful life; the EPA should consult with regional transmission organizations to determine the reliability impacts of the proposed rule; and the EPA should consider and incorporate current economic trends, including inflation, into any benefit-costs analysis supporting the rule. \n\nRegional Haze \n\nIn June 2005 the EPA issued its final Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) regulations that potentially could result in a requirement to install SO 2 and NO x pollution control technology as Best Available Retrofit Control Technology to continue operating certain of Entergy&#8217;s fossil generation units. The rule leaves certain CAVR determinations to the states. This rule establishes a series of 10-year planning periods, with states required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for each planning period, with each SIP including such air pollution control measures as may be necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of the CAVR by the year 2064. The various states are currently in the process of developing SIPs to implement the second planning period of the CAVR, which addresses the 2018-2028 planning period. \n\nIn January and February 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Power, and other co-owners received 60-day notice of intent to sue letters from the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association concerning allegations of violations of new source review and permitting provisions of the Clean Air Act at the Independence and White Bluff coal-burning units, respectively. In November 2018, following extensive negotiations, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Power entered a proposed settlement resolving those claims and reducing the risk that Entergy Arkansas, as operator of Independence and White Bluff, might be compelled under the Clean Air Act&#8217;s regional haze program to install costly emissions control technologies. Consistent with the terms of the settlement, Entergy Arkansas, along with co-owners, agreed to begin using only low-sulfur coal at Independence and White Bluff by mid-2021; agreed to cease using coal at White Bluff and Independence by the end of 2028 and 2030, respectively; agreed to cease operation of the remaining gas unit at Lake Catherine by the end of 2027; reserved the option to develop new generating sources at each plant site; and committed to installing or proposing to regulators at least 800 MWs of renewable generation by the end of 2027, with at least half installed or proposed by the end of 2022 (which includes two existing Entergy Arkansas projects) and with all qualifying co-owner projects counting toward satisfaction of the obligation. Under the settlement, the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association also waived certain potential existing claims under federal and state environmental law with respect to specified generating plants. The settlement, which formally resolves a complaint filed by the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, was subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. In November 2020 the court denied motions by the Arkansas Attorney General and the Arkansas Affordable Energy Coalition to intervene and to stay the proceedings. The proposed intervenors did not appeal the ruling. The District Court approved and entered the proposed settlement in March 2021. Entergy met the settlement deadline to use low-sulfur coal and is on target to meet the other requirements of the settlement. See &#8220; Remaining Useful Lives Review &#8221; in the &#8220; State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery &#8221; section of Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the APSC&#8217;s proceeding related to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s utility generation units. \n\nThe second planning period (2018-2028) for the regional haze program requires states to examine sources for impacts on visibility and to prepare SIPs by July 31, 2021 to ensure reasonable progress is being made to attain \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nvisibility improvements. Entergy received information collection requests from the Arkansas and Louisiana Departments of Environmental Quality requesting an evaluation of technical and economic feasibility of various NO x and SO 2 control technologies for Independence, Nelson 6, Nelson Industrial Steam Company (NISCO), and Ninemile. Responses to the information collection requests have been submitted to the respective state agencies. Louisiana has issued its draft SIP which, at this time, does not propose any additional air emissions controls for the affected Entergy units in Louisiana. Some public commenters, however, believe additional air controls are cost-effective. It is not yet clear how the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) will respond in its final SIP, and the agency, like many other state agencies, did not meet the July 31, 2021 deadline to submit a SIP to the EPA for review. \n\nSimilar to the LDEQ, the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) did not meet the July 31, 2021 SIP submission deadline, but subsequently submitted it to the EPA for review. The ADEQ reviewed Entergy&#8217;s Independence plant, but determined that additional air emission controls would not be cost-effective considering the facility&#8217;s commitment to cease coal-fired combustion by December 31, 2030. \n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has completed its second-planning period SIP and submitted it to the EPA for review. There were no Entergy sources selected for additional emission controls. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality continues to develop its SIP, but there are no Entergy sources that are expected to be impacted. \n\nIn August 2022 the EPA issued findings of failure to submit regional haze SIPs to 15 states, including Louisiana and Mississippi. These findings were effective September 2022 and start the two-year period for the EPA to either approve a SIP submitted by the state or issue a final federal plan. \n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions \n\nIn July 2019 the EPA released the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), which applies only to existing coal-fired electric generating units. The ACE determines that heat rate improvements are the best system of emission reductions and lists six candidate technologies for consideration by states at each coal unit. The rule and associated rulemakings by the EPA replace the Obama administration&#8217;s Clean Power Plan, which established national emissions performance rates for existing fossil-fuel fired steam electric generating units and combustion turbines. The ACE rule provides states discretion in determining how the best system for emission reductions applies to individual units, including through the consideration of technical feasibility and the remaining useful life of the facility. The ADEQ and the LDEQ have issued information collection requests to Entergy facilities to help the states collect the information needed to determine the best system of emission reductions for each facility. Entergy responded to the requests. In January 2021 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated ACE. The court held that ACE relied on an incorrect interpretation of the Clean Air Act that the statute expressly forecloses emission reduction approaches, such as emissions trading and generating shifting, that cannot be applied at and to the individual source. The court remanded ACE to the EPA for further consideration and also vacated the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. In March 2021 the D.C. Circuit issued a partial mandate vacating the ACE rule, but withheld the mandate vacating the repeal of the Clean Power Plan pending the EPA&#8217;s new rulemaking to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, there currently is no regulation in place with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric generating units and states are not expected to take further action to develop and submit plans at this time. In October 2021 the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the already vacated ACE rule. In June 2022 the United States Supreme Court held that the EPA could not use generation shifting as the best system of emission reduction under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA does still have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, but those emissions reductions must be technology based. The EPA has announced its intent to propose a rule for existing power plants pursuant to the Clean Air Act by March 2023. The ultimate impact of the United States Supreme Court's decision cannot be determined at this time. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nIn April 2021, President Biden announced a target for the United States in connection with the United Nations&#8217; &#8220;Paris Agreement&#8221; on climate change. The target consists of a 50-52 percent reduction in economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. President Biden has also stated that a goal of his administration is for the electric power industry to decarbonize fully by 2035. The details surrounding implementation of these targets are not finalized, and the impacts to Entergy of any potential related legislation cannot be predicted. \n\nEntergy continues to support national legislation that would most efficiently reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions and increase planning certainty for electric utilities. By virtue of its proportionally large investment in low-emitting generation technologies, Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission &#8220;intensity,&#8221; or rate of carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. In anticipation of the imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the electric industry, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide emissions. These voluntary actions included a formal program to stabilize owned power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in reducing emissions below 2000 levels. In 2006, Entergy started including emissions from controllable power purchases in addition to its ownership share of generation and established a second formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from controllable power purchases, cumulatively over the period, at 20% below 2000 levels through 2010. In 2011, Entergy extended this commitment through 2020, which it ultimately outperformed by approximately 8% both cumulatively and on an annual basis. In 2019, in connection with a climate scenario analysis following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures describing climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, Entergy announced a 2030 carbon dioxide emission rate goal focused on a 50% reduction from Entergy&#8217;s base year - 2000. Entergy now anticipates achieving this reduction several years early. In September 2020, Entergy announced a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 inclusive of all businesses, all applicable gases, and all emission scopes. In 2022, Entergy enhanced its commitment to include an interim goal of 50% carbon-free energy generating capacity by 2030 and expanded its interim emission rate goal to include all purchased power. See &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; in Part I Item 1A for discussion of the risks associated with achieving these climate goals. Entergy&#8217;s comprehensive, third-party verified greenhouse gas inventory and progress against its voluntary goals are published on its website. \n\nEntergy participates in the M.J. Bradley &#38; Associates&#8217; Annual Benchmarking Air Emissions Report, an annual analysis of the 100 largest U.S. electric power producers. The report is available on the M.J. Bradley website. Entergy participates annually in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and in 2022 was listed on the North American Index. Entergy has been listed on the World or North American Index, or both, for 21 consecutive years. Entergy also participated in the 2022 CDP Climate Change and CDP Water Security evaluations, receiving a &#8216;B&#8217; for both responses. \n\nPotential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments \n\nIn addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local level. Because of the nature of Entergy&#8217;s business, the imposition of any of these initiatives could affect Entergy&#8217;s operations. Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications. These initiatives include: \n\n&#8226; reconsideration and revision of ambient air quality standards downward which could lead to additional areas of nonattainment; \n\n&#8226; designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards; \n\n&#8226; introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA proposing further limits on SO 2 , mercury, carbon dioxide, and other air emissions. New legislation or regulations applicable to \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nstationary sources could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission sources, or other or combined regulatory programs; \n\n&#8226; efforts in Congress or at the EPA to establish a federal carbon dioxide emission tax, control structure, or unit performance standards; \n\n&#8226; revisions to the estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon and its use for regulatory impact analysis of federal laws and regulations; \n\n&#8226; implementation of the regional cap and trade programs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; \n\n&#8226; efforts on the local, state, and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards, clean energy standards, or a similar mechanism requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined renewable energy sources or energy sources with lower emissions; \n\n&#8226; efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent limitations for Entergy&#8217;s industry sector, stormwater runoff control regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements; \n\n&#8226; efforts to restrict the previously-approved continued use of oil-filled equipment containing certain levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); \n\n&#8226; efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of environmental, social, and governance risk; \n\n&#8226; the listing of additional species as threatened or endangered, the protection of critical habitat for these species, and developments in the legal protection of eagles and migratory birds; \n\n&#8226; the regulation of the management, disposal, and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals; and \n\n&#8226; the regulation of the management and disposal and recycling of equipment associated with renewable and clean energy sources such as used solar panels, wind turbine blades, hydrogen usage, or battery storage. \n\nClean Water Act \n\nThe 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program, section 402, and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act requires virtually all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted. Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United States, including jurisdictional wetlands. \n\nFederal Jurisdiction of Waters of the United States \n\nIn June 2020 the EPA&#8217;s revised definition of waters of the United States in the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) became effective, narrowing the scope of Clean Water Act jurisdiction, as compared to a 2015 definition which had been stayed by several federal courts. In August 2021 a federal district court vacated and remanded the NWPR for further consideration. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) subsequently issued a statement that the agencies would revert to pre-2015 regulations pending a new rulemaking. In December 2022 the EPA and the Corps released a final definition of waters of the United States that replaces the NWPR with a definition that is consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime as interpreted by several United States Supreme Court decisions. Most notably, the exclusion for waste treatment systems is retained. \n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 \n\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances may be or have been released. Certain private parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs. Parties that transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA. CERCLA has been interpreted to impose strict, joint, and several liability on responsible parties. Many states have adopted programs similar to CERCLA. Entergy subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have sent waste materials to various \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\ndisposal sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy facilities including nuclear facilities that have been or will be sold to decommissioning companies. In addition, environmental laws now regulate certain of Entergy&#8217;s operating procedures and maintenance practices that historically were not subject to regulation. Some disposal sites used by Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA or similar state programs, resulting in site clean-up activities. Entergy subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed experience with clean-up costs. The affected Entergy subsidiaries have established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and restoration activities. Details of potentially material CERCLA and similar state program liabilities are discussed in the &#8220; Other Environmental Matters &#8221; section below. \n\nCoal Combustion Residuals \n\nIn June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called &#8220;special wastes&#8221; under the hazardous waste program of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA. Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation. In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D. \n\nThe final regulations create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, product disposal considerations, and CCR unit closure criteria. Entergy believes that on-site disposal options will be available at its facilities, to the extent needed for CCR that cannot be transferred for beneficial reuse. As of December 31, 2022, Entergy has recorded asset retirement obligations related to CCR management of $27 million. \n\nPursuant to the EPA Rule, Entergy operates groundwater monitoring systems surrounding its coal combustion residual landfills located at White Bluff, Independence, and Nelson. Monitoring to date has detected concentrations of certain listed constituents in the area, but has not indicated that these constituents originated at the active landfill cells. Reporting has occurred as required, and detection monitoring will continue as the rule requires. In late-2017, Entergy determined that certain in-ground wastewater treatment system recycle ponds at its White Bluff and Independence facilities require management under the new EPA regulations. Consequently, in order to move away from using the recycle ponds, White Bluff and Independence each have installed a new permanent bottom ash handling system that does not fall under the CCR rule. As of November 2020, both sites are operating the new system and no longer are sending waste to the recycle ponds. Each site has commenced closure of its two recycle ponds (four ponds total), prior to the April 11, 2021 deadline under the finalized CCR rule for unlined recycle ponds. Any potential requirements for corrective action or operational changes under the new CCR rule continue to be assessed. Notably, ongoing litigation has resulted in the EPA&#8217;s continuing review of the rule. Consequently, the nature and cost of additional corrective action requirements may depend, in part, on the outcome of the EPA&#8217;s review. \n\nOther Environmental Matters \n\nEntergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas \n\nThe EPA notified Entergy that the EPA believes Entergy is a PRP concerning PCB contamination at the F.J. Doyle Salvage facility in Leonard, Texas. The facility operated as a scrap salvage business during the 1970s to the 1990s. In May 2018 the EPA investigated the site surface and sub-surface soils and, in November 2018 the EPA conducted a removal action, including disposal of PCB contaminated soils. Entergy responded to the EPA&#8217;s information requests in May and July 2019. In November 2020 the EPA sent Entergy and other PRPs a demand letter seeking reimbursement for response costs totaling $4 million expended at the site. Liability and PRP \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nallocation of response costs are yet to be determined. In December 2020, Entergy responded to the demand letter, without admitting liability or waiving any rights, indicating that it would engage in good faith negotiations with the EPA with respect to the demand. An initial meeting between the EPA and the PRPs took place in June 2021. Negotiations between the PRPs and the EPA are ongoing. \n\nLitigation \n\nEntergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. The litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk to Entergy. \n\nAsbestos Litigation &#160; (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) \n\nSee Note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of this litigation. \n\nEmployment and Labor-related Proceedings (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) \n\nSee Note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of these proceedings. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nEmployees \n\nEmployees are an integral part of Entergy&#8217;s commitment to serving customers. As of December 31, 2022, Entergy subsidiaries employed 11,707 people. \n\n##TABLE_START Utility: &#160; Entergy Arkansas 1,227 Entergy Louisiana 1,597 Entergy Mississippi 716 Entergy New Orleans 296 Entergy Texas 648 System Energy &#8212; Entergy Operations 3,317 Entergy Services 3,870 Entergy Nuclear Operations 13 Other subsidiaries 23 Total Entergy 11,707 ##TABLE_END\n\nApproximately 3,084 employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the United Government Security Officers of America, and the International Union, Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nBelow is the breakdown of Entergy&#8217;s employees by gender and race/ethnicity: \n\n##TABLE_START Gender (%) 2022 2021 Female 22.2 21.4 Male 77.8 78.6 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Race/Ethnicity (%) 2022 2021 White 74.8 76.4 Black/African American 17.3 16.4 Hispanic/Latino 3.0 2.7 Asian 2.3 2.0 Other 2.6 2.5 ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy&#8217;s Approach to Human Resources \n\nEntergy&#8217;s people and culture enable its success; that is why acquiring, retaining, and developing talent are important components of Entergy&#8217;s human resources strategy. Entergy focuses on an approach that includes, among other things, governance and oversight; safety; organizational health, including diversity, inclusion, and belonging; and talent management. \n\nGovernance and Oversight \n\nEnsuring that workplace processes support the desired culture and strategy begins with the Board of Directors and the Office of the Chief Executive. The Talent and Compensation Committee (formerly Personnel Committee) establishes priorities and each quarter reviews strategies and results on a range of topics covering the workforce, the workplace, and the marketplace. It oversees Entergy&#8217;s incentive plan design and administers its executive compensation plans to incentivize the behaviors and outcomes that support achievement of Entergy&#8217;s corporate objectives. Annually, it reviews executive performance, development, succession plans, and talent pipeline to align a high performing executive team with Entergy&#8217;s priorities. The Talent and Compensation Committee also oversees Entergy&#8217;s performance through regular briefings on a wide variety of human resources topics including Entergy&#8217;s safety culture and performance; organizational health; and diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives and performance. \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee&#8217;s Charter was revised in 2021 to acknowledge the committee&#8217;s responsibility for overseeing and monitoring the effectiveness of Entergy&#8217;s human capital strategies, including its workforce diversity, inclusion, and organizational health and safety strategies, programs, and initiatives. In recognition of the importance that organizational health and diversity, inclusion, and belonging play in enabling Entergy to achieve its business strategies, the committee receives periodic reports on Entergy&#8217;s organization health and diversity, inclusion, and belonging programs, strategies, and performance, including briefings at each of its regular meetings. The committee also receives updates on Entergy&#8217;s performance to date on key workforce, workplace, and marketplace measures, including progress in the representation of women and underrepresented minorities, both in the total workforce and in director level and above placements, progress in key diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives and diverse supplier spend. \n\nOther committees of the Board oversee other key aspects of Entergy&#8217;s culture. For example, the Audit Committee reviews reports on enterprise risks, ethics, and compliance training and performance, as well as regular reports on calls made to Entergy&#8217;s ethics line and related investigations. To maximize the sharing of information and facilitate the participation of all Board members in these discussions, the Board schedules its regular committee meetings in a manner such that all directors can attend. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nThe Office of the Chief Executive, which includes the Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, ensures annual business plans are designed to support Entergy&#8217;s talent objectives, reviews workforce-related metrics, and regularly discusses the development, succession planning, and performance of their direct reports and other company officers. \n\nSafety \n\nEntergy&#8217;s safety objective is: Everyone Safe. All Day. Every Day. The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and another historic hurricane season presented significant challenges. Entergy employees achieved a total recordable incident rate of 0.51 in 2022, compared to 0.46 in 2021, and 0.40 in 2020. The results of 2021 unfortunately included an employee fatality. Entergy has enhanced dramatically leadership efforts and field presence to further its objective of zero fatalities, which it achieved in 2022. Also in 2022, there was a significant decrease in the number of serious injuries. The recordable incident rate equals the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time equivalents. Recordable incidents include fatalities, lost-time accidents, restricted-duty accidents, and medical attentions and is not inclusive of potential work-related COVID-19 cases. \n\nOrganizational Health, including Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB) \n\nEntergy believes that organizational health fosters an engaged and productive culture that positions Entergy to deliver sustainable value to its stakeholders. Entergy measures its progress through an organizational health survey coordinated by an external third party. Since initially administering the survey in 2014, Entergy improved from an initial score of 49 (fourth quartile) to a score in 2020 of 72 (second quartile), in 2021 of 63 (third quartile), and in 2022 of 61 (third quartile). Although the score declined slightly in 2022 as compared to 2021, it improved from the 2014 baseline. Management uses the results of the annual survey to design and implement strategies to positively influence organizational health. Initial employee participation of 66 percent in 2014 rose to and remains at approximately 90 percent in 2019-2022. \n\nEntergy believes that creating a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging drives foundational engagement. Entergy is committed to developing and retaining a workforce that reflects the rich diversity of the communities it serves. In 2019, Entergy embarked on a three-year phased approach to enhance inclusion for individuals and teams. In 2022, Entergy continued to focus its actions to engage a diverse workforce, infusing DIB into hiring policies, practices and procedures, aligning Employee Resource Group goals to DIB goals, growing its DIB Champion network, integrating DIB into Entergy&#8217;s leadership development programs, and facilitating training from the executive leadership ranks down to the frontline. Through these efforts, Entergy aspires to create greater understanding and accountability regarding the behaviors and outcomes that are indicative of a premier utility. \n\nTalent Management \n\nEntergy&#8217;s focus on talent management is organized in three areas: developing and attracting a diverse pool of talent, equipping its leaders to develop the organization, and building premier utility capability through employee performance management and succession programs. Entergy believes that developing a diverse pool of local talent equipped with the skills needed, today and in the future, and reflecting the communities Entergy serves will give it a long-term competitive advantage. The focus of Entergy&#8217;s leadership development programs is to equip managers with the skills needed to effectively develop their teams and improve the leader-employee relationship. Entergy&#8217;s talent development infrastructure, which includes a combination of business function-specific and enterprise-wide learning and development programs, is designed to ensure Entergy has qualified staff with the skills, experiences, and behaviors needed to perform today and prepare for the future. Entergy strives to achieve its strategic priorities by aligning and enhancing team and individual performance with business objectives, effectively deploying talent through succession planning, and managing workforce transitions. \n\nPart I Item 1 \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nAvailability of SEC filings and other information on Entergy&#8217;s website \n\nEntergy electronically files reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxies, and amendments to such reports.

RISK FACTORS \n\nSee &#8220; RISK FACTORS SUMMARY &#8221; in Part I Item 1 for a summary of Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; risk factors. \n\nInvestors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; \n\nUtility Regulatory Risks \n\n(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) \n\nThe terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal, potentially resulting in delays in effecting rate changes, lengthy litigation, the risk of disallowance of recovery of certain costs, and uncertainty as to ultimate results. \n\nThe Utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures. The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or, in some cases, affected stakeholders. Regulators in a future rate proceeding may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be required, subject to applicable law. \n\nIn addition, regulators have initiated and may initiate additional proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; and System Energy&#8217;s base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the Utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. For a discussion of such appeals and related litigation for both the Utility operating companies and System Energy, see Note 2 to the financial statements. \n\nThe Utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation and maintenance of their assets and infrastructure, their preparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events and/or the time it takes to restore service after such events, or the quality of their service or the reasonableness of the cost of their \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nservice. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements or other legislation or regulatory actions that adversely affect the Utility operating companies. \n\nThe Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms, all of which could face resistance from customers and other stakeholders especially in a rising cost environment, whether due to inflation or high fuel prices or otherwise, and/or in periods of economic decline or hardship. Significant increases in costs could increase financing needs and otherwise adversely affect Entergy, the Utility operating companies, and System Energy&#8217;s business, financial position, results of operation, or cash flows. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. \n\nChanges to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and related activities could adversely affect Entergy and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and their utility businesses. \n\nIf legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the Utility operating companies&#8217; exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be materially affected. Additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and, together with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these technologies could result in reduced sales by the Utility operating companies. Such loss of sales, due to the methodology used to determine cost of service rates or otherwise, could put upward pressure on rates, possibly resulting in adverse regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates. Further, the failure of regulatory structures to evolve to accommodate the changing needs and desires of customers with respect to the sourcing and use of electricity also could diminish sales by the operating companies. Entergy and the Utility operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. \n\nThe Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings, and sudden or prolonged increases in fuel and purchased power costs could lead to increased customer arrearages or bad debt expenses. \n\nThe Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred or not reflected in rates as permitted by approved rate schedules and accounting rules, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages or when planned outages are extended, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs, particularly when there are substantial or sudden increases in such costs. Regulators also may initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. \n\nThe Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nof the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. The Utility operating companies also may experience, and in some instances have experienced, an increase in customer bill arrearages and bad debt expenses due to, among other reasons, increases in fuel and purchased power costs, especially in periods of economic decline or hardship. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power cost recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. \n\nThe Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. \n\nOn December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their owned and controlled generating facilities into the MISO resource adequacy construct (the annual Planning Resource Auction, discussed below), as well as the day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and resource adequacy construct. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell capacity, energy, and/or ancillary services in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, or the cost of serving the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective loads. MISO market rules may change or be interpreted in ways that cause additional cost and risk, including compliance risk. \n\nThe Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. Further, FERC policies and regulation addressing cost responsibility for transmission projects, including transmission projects to interconnect new generation facilities, may potentially give rise to cash and financing-related risks as well as result in upward pressure on the retail rates of the Utility operating companies, which, in turn, may result in adverse actions by the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators. In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from transmission projects of others or changes in FERC policies or regulation related to cost responsibility for transmission projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies&#8217; business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. \n\nFurther, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the MISO-wide allowed base rate of return on equity, and any required MISO-related charges and credits are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets, and the resulting costs, may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. \n\nMoreover, the resource adequacy construct provided under the MISO tariff confers certain rights and imposes certain obligations upon load-serving entities, including the Utility operating companies, that are served \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nfrom the transmission systems subject to MISO&#8217;s functional control, including the transmission facilities of the Utility operating companies. The MISO tariff provisions governing these rights and obligations are subject to change and have recently undergone significant changes, some of which are the subject of pending litigation and/or appeals. Due to their magnitude and the speed with which they have been implemented, these changes carry risk, including compliance risk, and may result in material additional costs being passed through to the Utility operating companies&#8217; customers in retail rates, including but not limited to additional capacity costs incurred in the annual MISO Planning Resource Auction. Also, by virtue of the Utility operating companies&#8217; participation in MISO and the design and terms of the MISO resource adequacy construct, other load-serving entities served by the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets, which are under MISO&#8217;s functional control, may be able to circumvent reasonable resource planning obligations and avoid, in whole or in part, the full cost of procuring the resources reasonably needed to reliably supply their respective loads. In particular, the design of the current MISO resource adequacy construct and the absence of a minimum capacity obligation in MISO create a risk of other load-serving entities engaging in &#8220;free ridership&#8221; through their strategy for participation in the MISO resource adequacy construct and energy and ancillary services markets &#8211; specifically, by using energy and ancillary services available from the Utility operating companies&#8217; owned and controlled generating units without paying a reasonable share of the cost of the capacity required to provide such energy and ancillary services. As a result, there are a variety of risks to the Utility operating companies and their customers, including the risk of bearing additional costs for resources needed to ensure reliable service, the risk of reduced reliability and the enhanced risk of outages and lost sales which, because of the methodology for establishing cost of service rates, presents the risk of upward pressure on the Utility operating companies&#8217; rates. \n\nIn addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. \n\nThe continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken on Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; business, results of operations, and financial condition are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\nThe global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic continues to be an evolving situation and could lead to further disruption of the general economy, impacts on the customers of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, and disruption of the operations of Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, whether due to, among other things, the emergence or spread of new variants of COVID-19, precautionary or reactionary measures, market reactions or impacts, or supply chain constraints. \n\nEntergy and its Utility operating companies experienced an increase in arrearages and bad debt expense due to non-payment by customers. The arrearages due to COVID-19 have begun to decline, although management cannot predict the timing of the completion of collections of such arrearages. While the Utility operating companies are working with regulators to ensure ultimate recovery for those and other COVID-19 related costs, the amount, method, and timing of such recovery is subject to approval by the retail regulators. \n\nEntergy and its Registrant Subsidiaries also could experience, and in some cases have experienced, among other challenges that originated during or have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: supply chain, vendor, and contractor disruptions, including shortages or delays in the availability of key components, parts, and supplies such as electronic components and solar panels; delays in completion of capital or other construction projects, maintenance, and other operations activities, including prolonged or delayed refueling and maintenance outages; delays in regulatory proceedings; workforce availability challenges, including from COVID-19 infections, health, or safety issues; increased storm recovery costs; increased cybersecurity risks as a result of many employees \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\ntelecommuting; volatility in the credit or capital markets (and any related increased cost of capital or any inability to access the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities); or other adverse impacts on their ability to execute on business strategies and initiatives. \n\nAlthough the economy has been recovering, another economic decline could adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity and cash flows, including through declining sales, reduced revenues, delays in receipts of customer payments, or increased bad debt expense. The Utility operating companies also may experience regulatory outcomes that require them to postpone planned investment and otherwise reduce costs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their customers, especially in an environment of higher inflation. In addition, if the COVID-19 pandemic or related impacts create additional disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s credit metrics or ratings, such developments could adversely affect its ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs or cause a decrease in the value of its defined benefit pension trust funds, as well as its nuclear decommissioning trust funds, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\nEntergy cannot predict the extent or duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of new or existing variants of COVID-19, the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, further governmental responsive measures, or the extent of the effects or ultimate impacts on the global, national or local economy, the capital markets, or its customers, suppliers, operations, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\n(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) \n\nA delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather, the impact on customer bills of permitted storm cost recovery, or the inability to securitize future storm restoration costs could have material effects on Entergy and its Utility operating companies. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred, inability to securitize future storm restoration costs, or loss of revenues as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather, including lower credit ratings and, thus, higher costs for future debt issuances. The inability to recover losses either excluded by insurance or in excess of the insurance limits that can be secured economically also could have a material effect on Entergy and its Utility operating companies. In addition, the recovery of major storm restoration costs from customers could effectively limit our ability to make planned capital or other investments due to the impact of such storm cost recovery on customer bills, especially in a rising cost environment. \n\nIn August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused extensive damage to the Entergy distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission systems across Louisiana, resulting in storm costs of $2.5 billion. Entergy Louisiana began recovering a portion of these costs through securitization financings in 2022. In January 2023 the LPSC issued orders finding prudent the costs incurred by Entergy Louisiana in responding to Hurricane Ida and allowing Entergy Louisiana to securitize the remaining $1.491 billion in such costs. Because such orders are not yet final and non-appealable (due to the forty-five day appeal period) and, further, because the bond rating and marketing process has yet to occur, there is an element of risk, and Entergy Louisiana is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate success of its recovery initiatives or the timing of such recovery. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nWeather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas sales and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations and system reliability. \n\nTemperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage and resulting revenues. Higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal pricing differentials typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Changing weather patterns and extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes or tropical storms, flooding events, or ice storms, the frequency or intensity of which may be exacerbated by climate change, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, criticism or adverse publicity, and reduced customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies, and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand. In addition, changes to regulatory policies, such as those that allow customers to directly access the market to procure wholesale energy or those that incentivize development and utilization of new, developing, or alternative sources of generation, could, and in some instances, have reduced sales, and other non-traditional procurements, such as virtual purchase power agreements, could, and in some instances have limited growth opportunities or reduced sales at the Utility operating companies. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and lighting and their replacement with more efficient ones and adoption of newer technologies, including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar, are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales or sales growth in the future. \n\nThe Utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to Entergy&#8217;s customers. Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Negative changes in any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Utility operating companies also may not realize anticipated or expected growth in industrial sales from electrification opportunities to help such customers achieve their environmental and sustainability goals. This could occur because of changes in customers&#8217; goals or business priorities, competition from other companies, or decisions by such customers to seek to achieve such goals through methods not offered by Entergy. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nNuclear Operating, Shutdown, and Regulatory Risks \n\n(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are expected to consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nNuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies and System Energy. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, there is pressure on plant owners to operate nuclear power plants at higher capacity factors, though such operations always must be consistent with safety, reliability, and nuclear regulatory requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower nuclear plant capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. \n\nOutages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which may extend the planned outage duration beyond that required for only refueling activities. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may increase. \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nBased upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2027. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or limitations on importation of uranium or uranium products from foreign countries, geopolitical conditions, or shifting trade arrangements between countries. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\ntherefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon foreign countries, such as Russia, and international sanctions or tariffs impacting trade with such countries could further restrict the ability of such suppliers or service providers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable prices or at all. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nUnder the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry - NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. \n\nEvents at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy. \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nThe nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by these Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For these Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nand potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. \n\nMoreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, and System Energy. \n\nThe costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. \n\nCertain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act and/or by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. \n\nAccidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies and System Energy carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial Protection. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor. With 96 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies and System Energy, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\npay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $688 million). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap. \n\nNEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy. NEIL provides onsite property and decontamination coverage. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of January 1, 2023, the maximum annual assessment amounts total approximately $70 million for the Utility plants. Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. \n\nAs mentioned above, as an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy. \n\nThe decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. \n\nOwners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. \n\nUnder NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. If the projected amount of each individual plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its NRC license termination decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nFurther, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant owned by certain of the Utility operating companies or System Energy or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. Such changes also could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. As a result, under any of these circumstances, the results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy could be materially affected. \n\nAn early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results, or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that certain of the Utility operating companies or System Energy may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to these Utility operating companies or System Energy, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all. \n\nFor further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, management&#8217;s decision to exit the merchant power business, and the impairment charges that resulted from such decision, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and Notes 9, 14, and 16 to the financial statements. \n\nNew or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. \n\nNew and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel. These concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating, and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nGeneral Business \n\n(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) \n\nEntergy and its Registrant Subsidiaries depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service area with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nHurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Isaac in 2012, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta in 2020, and Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida in 2021. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including an adverse decision or a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, and System Energy, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. \n\nThe inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Access to capital markets could be restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in offerings to fund fossil fuel projects or companies that are impacted by extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels, or that are impacted by risks related to climate change. Factors beyond Entergy&#8217;s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. These factors include depressed economic conditions, a recession, increasing interest rates, inflation, sanctions, trade restrictions, political instability, war, terrorism, and extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility, and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. \n\nA downgrade in Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital or the cost of such capital and/or could require Entergy or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. \n\nThere are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant Subsidiary&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, storm risk exposure, diversification, and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy&#8217;s or any of the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. \n\nMost of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy&#8217;s or the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy or its subsidiaries. \n\nEntergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability to meet its stated goals or commitments, among other potential causes. \n\nAs with any company, Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; reputations are an important element of their ability to effectively conduct their business. Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; reputations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: failure of a generating asset or supporting infrastructure; failure to restore \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\npower after a hurricane or other severe weather event in a manner perceived as timely by regulators or customers; the incurrence of storm restoration costs perceived as excessive by regulators or customers; failure to effectively manage land and other natural resources; real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change; real or perceived issues with Entergy&#8217;s safety culture or work environment; inability to meet their climate or human capital strategy goals; inability to keep their electricity rates stable; involvement in a class-action or other high-profile lawsuit; significant delays in construction projects; occurrence of or responses to cyber attacks or security vulnerabilities; acts or omissions of Entergy management or acts or omissions of a contractor or other third-party working with or for Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries, which actually or perceivably reflect negatively on Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries; measures taken to offset reductions in demand or to supply rising demand; a significant dispute with one of Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; customers or other stakeholders; or negative political and public sentiment resulting in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse statements affecting Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries. \n\nAddressing any adverse publicity or regulatory scrutiny is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made (or lack thereof), can have a negative impact on the reputations of Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries, on the morale and performance of their employees, and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers, and commercial counterparties. Adverse publicity or regulatory scrutiny may also have a negative impact on Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ability to take timely advantage of various business or market opportunities. \n\nDeterioration in Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; reputations may harm Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; relationships with their customers, regulators, and other stakeholders, may increase their cost of doing business, may interfere with its ability to attract and retain a qualified, inclusive, and diverse workforce, may impact Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ability to raise debt capital, and may potentially lead to the enactment of new laws and regulations, or the modification of existing laws and regulations, that negatively affect the way Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries conduct their business, or may have a material adverse effect on their financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and CARES Act of 2020 significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 further significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, enacting a new corporate alternative minimum tax and expanding federal tax credits for clean energy production. The interpretive guidance issued by the IRS and state tax authorities may be inconsistent with Entergy&#8217;s own interpretation and the legislation could be subject to amendments, which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. Further, changes in tax legislation or guidance, or uncertainties regarding interpretation of such tax legislation or guidance, could impact interpretation of and negotiations around certain contractual arrangements with counterparties, which could result in unfavorable changes to such arrangements or delays. In addition, the retail regulatory treatment of the expanded tax credits and corporate alternative minimum tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could materially impact Entergy&#8217;s future cash flows, and this legislation could result in unintended consequences not yet identified that could have a material adverse impact on Entergy&#8217;s financial results and future cash flows. \n\nBased on initial IRS guidance and current internal forecasts, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 beginning in the next two to three years. \n\nThe tax rate decrease included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required Entergy to record a regulatory liability for income taxes payable to customers. Such regulatory liability for income taxes is described in Note 3 to the \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nfinancial statements. Depending on the outcome of IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. \n\nSee Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 2022, 2021, and 2020 results of operations and financial condition, the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For further discussion of the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, see the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 to the financial statements. \n\nChanges in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws or interpretive guidance relating thereto, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The intended and unintended consequences of recently enacted legislation could have a material adverse impact on Entergy&#8217;s financial results and future cash flows. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies, which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations, and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; future prospects and results of operations significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business strategies, including achieving Entergy&#8217;s climate goals and commitments, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic, and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control. As a result, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. \n\nAdditionally, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring, or other strategic transactions. For example, a significant portion of Entergy&#8217;s utility business plan over the next several years includes the construction and/or purchase of a variety of solar facilities. These or other transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies, including increased costs or delays resulting from supply chain issues. The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; financial condition or results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: \n\n&#8226; acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings, or cash flow at anticipated levels; \n\n&#8226; acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting, or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\n&#8226; Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; \n\n&#8226; Entergy may experience issues integrating businesses into its internal controls over financial reporting; \n\n&#8226; the disposition of a business could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; \n\n&#8226; Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and \n\n&#8226; Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on their business, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\nThe completion of capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, and other capital improvements, involve substantial risks. Should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, such as transmission and distribution infrastructure replacements or upgrades, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance, reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance, continued pandemic-related delays and cost increases, and supply chains and material constraints, including those that may result from major storm events, both within and outside of Entergy&#8217;s service area. Delays in obtaining permits, challenges in securing sufficient land for the siting of solar panels, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, further direct and indirect trade and tariff issues, including those associated with imported solar panels, supply chain delays or disruptions, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. \n\nFor further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service areas, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. \n\nFailure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations. \n\nEntergy relies on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors, and temporary staffing. Certain factors, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nanticipate future workforce needs, workforce impacts from public health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures, challenges competing with other employers offering fully remote work options, rising salary and other labor costs, or the unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include inability to attract or retain talent, lack of resources, loss of knowledge base, and the time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor, may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to develop and operate a modernized, technology-enabled, and lower carbon power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be negatively affected. \n\nEntergy and Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. \n\nThe businesses in which Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies and System Energy conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies and System Energy to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, are subject to potential liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies and System Energy and of property potentially contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies currently are involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. \n\nEmissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated emissions from generating plants potentially are subject to increased regulation, controls, and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing environmental regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to regulate, or otherwise compel reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, and water availability issues are discussed below. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, including Entergy&#8217;s response to climate change, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nThe Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the NERC, the SERC, and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. In addition, the retail regulators of the Utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations. \n\nEnvironmental and regulatory obligations intended to combat the effects of climate change, including by compelling greenhouse gas emission reductions or reporting, increasing clean or renewable energy requirements, or placing a price on greenhouse gas emissions, or the achievement of voluntary climate commitments could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy. \n\nIn an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations have focused considerable attention on CO 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. The EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles, and from new, existing, and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. Such regulations continue to evolve. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO 2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO 2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. In Louisiana, the Office of the Governor announced the creation of a Climate Initiatives Task Force and issued an executive order that established a path to net-zero emissions by 2050 while the City Council of New Orleans passed a renewable and clean portfolio standard that sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 and absolute zero emissions by 2050. The impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk and any judicial interpretation thereof will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions currently is unclear. \n\nDeveloping and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or reporting or clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. The operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing Entergy&#8217;s greenhouse gas emission rate. Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies or System Energy, do business. Violations of such requirements may subject the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nor property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. Further, real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or inability to meet Entergy&#8217;s voluntary climate commitments, could adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s reputation or inhibit Entergy&#8217;s ability to pursue its decarbonization objectives. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. \n\nFuture changes in regulation or policies governing the reporting or emission of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional costs to Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, their suppliers, or customers, (ii) make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and stranded costs if Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies are unable to fully recover the costs and investment in generation, and (iv) increase the difficulty that Entergy and its Utility operating companies have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. \n\nIn March 2019, Entergy voluntarily set a climate goal to achieve a 50 percent reduction in its carbon emission rate from the year 2000 by 2030. In September 2020, Entergy voluntarily committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In November 2022, Entergy voluntarily set a climate goal to achieve 50 percent carbon-free energy capacity by 2030. Risks to achieving the 2030 and 2050 goals include, among other things, the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, regulatory approvals, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, and supply chain costs and constraints. Technology research and development, innovation, and advancements in carbon-free generation are also critical to Entergy&#8217;s ability to achieve its 2050 commitment. Entergy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects, on its system reliability, or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. \n\nThe physical effects of climate change could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. \n\nPotential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, more frequent or intense hurricanes and wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, flooding and changes in weather conditions (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supplies necessary for operations. \n\nThese and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy system&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, criticism or adverse publicity, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nDue in part to the recent increase in frequency and intensity of major storm activity along the Gulf Coast, Entergy is developing plans to accelerate investments that would enhance the resilience of the electric systems of the Utility operating companies to enable them to better withstand major storms or other adverse weather events, to enable more rapid restoration of electricity after major storm or other adverse events, and to deliver electricity to critical customers more immediately after such events. The need for this investment and these expenditures could give rise to liquidity, capital or other financing-related risks as well as result in upward pressure on the retail rates of the Utility operating companies, which, particularly when combined with upward pressure resulting from the recovery of the costs of recent and future storms, may result in adverse actions by the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators or effectively limit the ability to make other planned capital or other investments. \n\nContinued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. \n\nWater is a vital natural resource that is also critical to Entergy and its subsidiaries. Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries secure water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operate under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy and its subsidiaries also obtain and operate in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nTo manage near-term and medium-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. \n\nAlthough Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nwill have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. \n\nEntergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. \n\nThe Utility operating companies and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations. \n\nThe hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and Entergy's non-regulated operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. \n\nMarket performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. \n\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. \n\nThe litigation environment in the states in which the Registrant Subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries and related entities are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and customer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Registrant Subsidiaries operate have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\ncases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. \n\nTerrorist attacks, physical attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; or their suppliers&#8217; infrastructure or technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software, network infrastructure, and other technologies that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. The functionality of Entergy&#8217;s technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology. Suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of customers, employees, and others, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply-chain activities. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems could result in loss of or inappropriate access to data or disruptions of operations. \n\nThere have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments. As an operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face a heightened risk of physical attacks or acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, including ransomware attacks, and data breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers, infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions as well as against the systems of critical suppliers and contractors. Further, attacks may become more frequent in the future as technology becomes more prevalent in energy infrastructure. An attack could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct business. \n\nGiven the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats, Entergy&#8217;s technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security and controls. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems, or those of critical suppliers or contractors, were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and could result in a loss of or inappropriate access to its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, suppliers, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. \n\nAny such attacks, failures, or data breaches could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Although Entergy and the Utility operating companies purchase insurance for cyber attacks and data breaches, such insurance prices have increased substantially, and coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses that might arise in connection with these events. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines). \n\nEntergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs. \n\nThe global economic cost to insurers resulting from cyber attacks, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, in addition to an increased focus on climate issues could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance capacity may decrease, and the insurance policies that Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive terms and conditions. Further, the insurance policies of Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries may not cover all of their potential exposures or actual amounts of losses incurred. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nSignificant increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses may adversely affect Entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nEntergy and its subsidiaries have observed and expect future inflationary pressures related to commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses, including in the areas of labor, health care, and pension costs. The contracts for the construction of certain o f the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities also have included, and in the future may include, price adjustment provisions that, subject to certain limitations, may enable the contractor to increase the contract price to reflect increases in certain costs of constructing the facility. These inflationary pressures could impact the ability of Entergy and its subsidiaries to control costs and/or make substantial investments in their businesses, including their ability to recover costs and investments, and to earn their allowed return on equity within frameworks established by their regulators while maintaining affordability of their services for their customers, in addition to having unpredictable effects on Entergy&#8217;s customers. Increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses, including increasing labor costs and costs and funding requirements associated with Entergy's defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits, could increase their financing needs and otherwise adversely affect their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\n(Entergy New Orleans) \n\nThe effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. \n\nGas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. When purchased gas cost charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which, given its relatively smaller size, could adversely affect results of operations. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. \n\n(Entergy Corporation and System Energy) \n\nSystem Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for all of its revenues. Certain contractual arrangements relating to System Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings. The aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the current net book value of System Energy. In the event of an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings requiring the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would be required to seek financing to pay such refunds which financing may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required. If one or more of the foregoing events occurs, System Energy may be required to explore other options or protections available to it to extend, restructure, or retire its indebtedness and to prioritize its obligations. \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies (other than Entergy Texas) as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which currently expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies (other than Entergy Texas) \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nunder the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, and a prudence complaint challenging the extended power uprate completed at Grand Gulf in 2012 and the operation and management of Grand Gulf, particularly in the 2016-2020 time period. \n\nThe claims in these proceedings include claims for refunds and claims for rate adjustments. The aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the current net book value of System Energy. Entergy Corporation is not obligated to provide funding to System Energy to enable it to pay any such refunds. In the event that an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings required the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would need to source additional financing to pay such refunds. Such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required. An adverse development in one or more of these proceedings also could jeopardize System Energy&#8217;s ability to finance its operations and pay its obligations, at a reasonable cost or when due. If one or more of the foregoing events occurs, System Energy may be required to explore other options or protections available to it to extend, restructure, or retire its indebtedness and to prioritize its obligations. One or more rating agencies may downgrade the ratings of System Energy or its debt securities, which could adversely affect the market prices of System Energy&#8217;s debt securities and otherwise adversely affect System Energy&#8217;s financial condition. \n\nIn addition, an order requiring System Entergy to pay substantial additional refunds could result in a default and, in certain cases, acceleration under one or more of System Energy&#8217;s existing bond indentures, credit agreements, or other financing arrangements. Certain events constituting events of default under System Energy&#8217;s financing agreements may also result in defaults under, or acceleration with respect to, financing arrangements involving certain credit agreement and guarantee obligations of Entergy Corporation. \n\nThese proceedings are pending before their respective adjudicators and no final decisions have been reached. Thus, Entergy cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any of these proceedings, or the magnitude of any refunds or rate adjustments, and an adverse outcome in any of them could have a material adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In particular, in connection with the uncertain tax position proceeding and related December 2022 FERC order and System Energy&#8217;s compliance report filed in January 2023, if the FERC were to order additional refunds at a level consistent with the position of the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council on the remedy for the formerly uncertain tax positions, System Energy&#8217;s continued financial viability would be jeopardized. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. The Utility operating companies (other than Entergy Texas) have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nFor information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to certain Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy, see Notes 5 and 8 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. \n\n(Entergy Corporation) \n\nEntergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory, or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability. \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nPublic utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations include legal entities that meet the definition of a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted those entities the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant those entities market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that those entities can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if one of those entities were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1.29 million per day per violation. If one of those entities were to lose their market-based rate authority, it would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates those entities charge for power from its facilities. \n\nEntergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as by changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operator. The Independent System Operator that oversees the relevant wholesale power market may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in that market. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. \n\nThe regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. \n\nAs a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock, and has provided, and may continue to provide, capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries, which would reduce the funds available to meet its other financial obligations. \n\nEntergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation has provided, and may continue to provide, capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Entergy&#8217;s common stock. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make distributions to Entergy Corporation. The ability of such subsidiaries to make payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy \n\nPart I Item 1A and 1B \n\nEntergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy \n\nCorporation depends on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to Entergy Corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of Entergy Utility Holding Company and Entergy Texas, dividends and distributions on preferred securities. Any distributions from the Registrant Subsidiaries other than Entergy Texas and System Energy are paid directly to Entergy Utility Holding Company and are therefore subject to prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities. \n\n"

See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the 2021 formula rate plan filing. \n\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales and an increase in demand charges as a result of an updated contract with an industrial customer in the primary metals industry, partially offset by a decrease in weather-adjusted residential usage . \n\nThe return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a tax adjustment rider beginning in April 2018. In 2021, $8 million was returned to customers. There was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Arkansas for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 % Change (GWh) Residential 8,147 7,914 3 Commercial 5,615 5,491 2 Industrial 8,493 8,466 &#8212; Governmental 218 225 (3) Total retail 22,473 22,096 2 Sales for resale: Associated companies 1,906 2,254 (15) Non-associated companies 6,520 6,151 6 Total 30,899 30,501 1 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s operating revenues. \n\nOther Income Statement Variances \n\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $24.1 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance costs, higher safety and training costs, and higher reliability costs, partially offset by a decrease in meter reading expenses as a result of the deployment of advanced metering systems; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $17 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2022 as compared to 2021 and higher nuclear labor costs ; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $11.6 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work, including during plant outages, performed in 2022 as compared to 2021 and higher costs associated with materials and supplies in 2022 as compared to 2021; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $7.9 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to the timing of recovery from customers, partially offset by lower energy efficiency costs; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $4.6 million in customer service center support costs primarily due to higher contract costs. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments and millage rate increases, increases in employment taxes, and increases in local franchise taxes. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including the Searcy Solar facility, which was placed in service in December 2021. \n\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes the reversal in first quarter 2021 of the remaining $38.8 million regulatory liability for the 2019 historical year netting adjustment as part of its 2020 formula rate plan proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2020 formula rate plan filing. In addition, Entergy Arkansas records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. \n\nOther income decreased primarily due to changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of the decommissioning trust funds in 2021. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nInterest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $200 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2022 and the issuance of $400 million of 3.35% Series mortgage bonds in March 2021, partially offset by the repayment of $350 million of 3.75% Series mortgage bonds in February 2021. \n\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects the earnings or losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest partner of the tax equity partnership for the Searcy Solar facility under HLBV accounting. Entergy Arkansas recorded regulatory charges of $4.5 million in 2022 compared to $18.1 million in 2021 to defer the difference between the losses allocated to the tax equity partner under the HLBV method of accounting and the earnings/loss that would have been allocated to the tax equity partner under its respective ownership percentage in the partnership. See Note 1 to the financial statements for discussion of the HLBV method of accounting. \n\nThe effective income tax rates were 21.6% for 2022 and 20.1% for 2021. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nIncome Tax Legislation \n\nSee the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow \n\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $12,915 $192,128 $3,519 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 699,732 549,216 659,818 Investing activities (852,794) (898,193) (795,709) Financing activities 145,425 169,764 324,500 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (7,637) (179,213) 188,609 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $5,278 $12,915 $192,128 ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $150.5 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher collections from customers; \n\n&#8226; the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease in spending of $23.6 million on nuclear refueling outages in 2022. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; payments to vendors, including timing and increase in cost of operations; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $26.3 million in pension contributions in 2022. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $16.2 million in income tax refunds. Entergy Arkansas received income tax refunds in 2022 and 2021, each in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased $45.4 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; the purchase of the Searcy Solar facility by the tax equity partnership in December 2021 for approximately $131.8 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Searcy Solar facility purchase; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $16.6 million in non-nuclear generation construction expenditures primarily due to a lower scope of work on projects performed in 2022 as compared to 2021. \n\nThe decrease was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $78.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to higher capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022 and increased investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s distribution system, partially offset by lower spending in 2022 on advanced metering infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $27.2 million in decommissioning trust fund investment activity; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $19 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work on projects performed in 2022 as compared to 2021. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased $24.3 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $400 million of 3.35% Series mortgage bonds in March 2021; \n\n&#8226; money pool activity; \n\n&#8226; capital contributions of $51.2 million received in 2021 from the noncontrolling tax equity investor in AR Searcy Partnership, LLC and used by the partnership to acquire the Searcy Solar facility. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Searcy Solar facility purchase; \n\n&#8226; lower prepaid deposits of $50.9 million related to contributions-in-aid-of-construction reimbursement agreements in 2022 as compared to 2021; and \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n&#8226; an increase of $36 million in common equity distributions paid in 2022 as compared to 2021 in order to maintain Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s capital structure. \n\nThe decrease was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; the repayment, at maturity, of $350 million of 3.75% Series mortgage bonds in February 2021; \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $200 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2022; and \n\n&#8226; the repayment, at maturity, of $45 million of 2.375% Series governmental bonds in January 2021. \n\nIncreases in Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s payable to the money pool increased $40.9 million in 2022 compared to increasing by $139.9 million in 2021. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries&#8217; need for external short-term borrowings. \n\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for further details of long-term debt. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt to capital 52.5 % 52.6 % Effect of subtracting cash &#8212; % &#8212; % Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 52.5 % 52.6 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Entergy Arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nEntergy Arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy Arkansas may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nUses of Capital \n\nEntergy Arkansas requires capital resources for: \n\n&#8226; construction and other capital investments; \n\n&#8226; debt maturities or retirements; \n\n&#8226; working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and \n\n&#8226; distribution and interest payments. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s planned construction and other capital investments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 &#160; (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment: &#160; &#160; Generation $255 $1,175 $910 Transmission 110 160 135 Distribution 285 425 350 Utility Support 105 65 90 Total $755 $1,825 $1,485 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s portfolio, including Walnut Bend Solar, West Memphis Solar, and Driver Solar; investments in ANO 1 and 2; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to drive reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. \n\nWhile Entergy Arkansas is still assessing the effect on its planned solar projects, the investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce into potential circumvention of duties and tariffs may result in increased duties or tariffs on imported solar panels and has exacerbated previously existing supply chain disruptions, which have negatively affected the timing and cost of completion of these projects. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026-2027 After 2027 &#160; (In Millions) Long-term debt (a) $432 $504 $123 $898 $5,060 Operating leases (b) $16 $14 $12 $16 $2 Finance leases (b) $3 $3 $3 $4 $2 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. \n\n(b) Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nOther Obligations \n\nEntergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $54.5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $526 thousand to its other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. \n\nEntergy Arkansas has $175.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nIn addition, Entergy Arkansas enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations. Entergy Arkansas has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Arkansas pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. \n\nRenewables \n\nWalnut Bend Solar \n\nIn October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 100 MW Walnut Bend Solar facility is in the public interest. Entergy Arkansas primarily requested cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In July 2021 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s petition and approved the acquisition of the resource and cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In addition, the APSC directed Entergy Arkansas to file a report within 180 days detailing its efforts to obtain a tax equity partnership. In January 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed its tax equity partnership status report and will file subsequent reports until a tax equity partnership is obtained or a tax equity partnership is no longer sought. Closing was expected to occur in 2022. The counter-party notified Entergy Arkansas that it was terminating the project, though it was willing to consider an alternative for the site. Entergy Arkansas disputed the right of termination. Negotiations are ongoing, including with respect to cost and schedule and to updates arising as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the updates would require additional APSC approval. At this time, the project, if approved, is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2024. \n\nWest Memphis Solar \n\nIn January 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 180 MW West Memphis Solar facility is in the public interest. In October 2021 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s petition and approved the acquisition of the West Memphis Solar facility and cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In addition, the APSC directed Entergy Arkansas to file a report within 180 days detailing its efforts to obtain a tax equity partnership. In April 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed its tax equity partnership status report and will file subsequent reports until a tax equity partnership is obtained or a tax equity partnership is no longer sought. Closing had been expected to occur in 2023. In March 2022 the counter-party notified Entergy Arkansas that it was seeking changes to certain terms of the build-own-transfer agreement, including both cost and schedule. In January 2023, Entergy Arkansas filed a supplemental application with the APSC seeking approval for a change in the transmission route and updates to the cost and schedule that were previously approved by the APSC. The project is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2024. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nDriver Solar \n\nIn April 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the purchase of the 250 MW Driver Solar facility is in the public interest and requested cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. The APSC established a procedural schedule with a hearing scheduled in June 2022, but the parties later agreed to waive the hearing and submit the matter to the APSC for a decision consistent with the filed record. In August 2022 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s petition and approved the acquisition of Driver Solar and cost recovery through the formula rate plan rider. In addition, the APSC directed Entergy Arkansas to inform the APSC as to the status of a tax equity partnership once construction is commenced. The parties are evaluating the effects of certain matters related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, including the viability of a tax equity partnership. The project is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2024. \n\nSources of Capital \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s sources to meet its capital requirements include: \n\n&#8226; internally generated funds; \n\n&#8226; cash on hand; \n\n&#8226; the Entergy System money pool; \n\n&#8226; debt or preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; capital contributions; and \n\n&#8226; bank financing under new or existing facilities. \n\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit. \n\nAll debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s bond indenture and other agreements. Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 (In Thousands) ($180,795) ($139,904) $3,110 ($21,634) ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. \n\nEntergy Arkansas has a credit facility in the amount of $150 million scheduled to expire in June 2027. Entergy Arkansas also has a $25 million credit facility scheduled to expire in April 2023. The $150 million credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $5 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2022, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facilities. In addition, Entergy Arkansas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO. As of December 31, 2022, $5.6 million in \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nletters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s uncommitted letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of the credit facilities. \n\nThe Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $80 million scheduled to expire in June 2025. As of December 31, 2022, there were no loans outstanding under the credit facility for the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility. \n\nEntergy Arkansas obtained authorization from the FERC through October 2023 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $250 million at any time outstanding and borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy Arkansas are limited to amounts authorized by the FERC. The APSC has concurrent jurisdiction over Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s first mortgage bond/secured issuances. Entergy Arkansas has obtained long-term financing authorization from the FERC that extends through October 2023. Entergy Arkansas has obtained first mortgage bond/secured financing authorization from the APSC that extends through December 2023. \n\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery \n\nThe rates that Entergy Arkansas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Arkansas is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the APSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. \n\nRetail Rates \n\n2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn July 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2020 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2021 calendar year. The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s earnings for the projected year 2021, as amended through subsequent filings in the proceeding, and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2019. The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2021 projected year is 8.22% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $64.3 million. The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2019 historical year was 9.07% resulting in a $23.9 million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the 2021 projected year and 2019 historical year netting adjustment was $88.2 million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $74.3 million. As part of the formula rate plan tariff the calculation for the revenue constraint was updated based on actual revenues which had the effect of reducing the initially-proposed $74.3 million revenue requirement increase to $72.6 million. In October 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a unanimous settlement agreement reached with the other parties that resolved all but one issue. As a result of the settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s requested revenue increase was $68.4 million, including a $44.5 million increase for the projected 2021 year and a $23.9 million netting adjustment. The remaining issue litigated concerned the methodology used to calculate the netting adjustment within the formula rate plan. In December 2020 the APSC issued an order rejecting the netting adjustment method used by Entergy Arkansas. Applying the approach ordered by the APSC changed the netting adjustment for the 2019 historical year from a $23.9 million deficiency to $43.5 million excess. Overall, the decision reduced Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s revenue adjustment for 2021 to $1 million. In December 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition for rehearing of the APSC&#8217;s decision in the 2020 formula rate plan proceeding regarding the 2019 netting adjustment, and in January 2021 the APSC granted further consideration of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s petition. Based on the progress of the proceeding at that point, in December 2020, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory liability of $43.5 million to reflect the netting adjustment for 2019, as included in the APSC&#8217;s December 2020 order, which would be returned \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nto customers in 2021. Entergy Arkansas also requested an extension of the formula rate plan rider for a second five-year term. In March 2021 the Arkansas Governor signed HB1662 into law (Act 404). Act 404 clarified aspects of the original formula rate plan legislation enacted in 2015, including with respect to the extension of a formula rate plan, the methodology for the netting adjustment, and debt and equity levels; it also reaffirmed the customer protections of the original formula rate plan legislation, including the cap on annual formula rate plan rate changes. Pursuant to Act 404, Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s formula rate plan rider was extended for a second five-year term. Entergy Arkansas filed a compliance tariff in its formula rate plan docket in April 2021 to effectuate the netting provisions of Act 404, which reflected a net change in required formula rate plan rider revenue of $39.8 million, effective with the first billing cycle of May 2021. In April 2021 the APSC issued an order approving the compliance tariff and recognizing the formula rate plan extension. Also in April 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed for approval of modifications to the formula rate plan tariff incorporating the provisions in Act 404, and the APSC approved the tariff modifications in April 2021. Given the APSC general staff&#8217;s support for the expedited approval of these filings by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas supported an amendment to Act 404 to achieve a reduced return on equity from 9.75% to 9.65% to apply for years applicable to the extension term; that amendment was signed by the Arkansas Governor in April 2021 and is now Act 894. Based on the APSC&#8217;s order issued in April 2021, in the first quarter 2021, Entergy Arkansas reversed the remaining regulatory liability for the netting adjustment for 2019. In June 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed another compliance tariff in its formula rate plan proceeding to effectuate the additional provisions of Act 894, and the APSC approved the second compliance tariff filing in July 2021. \n\n2021 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn July 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2021 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2022 calendar year. The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s earnings for the projected year 2022 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2020. The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2022 projected year is 7.65% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $89.2 million. The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2020 historical year was 7.92% resulting in a $19.4 million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the 2022 projected year and 2020 historical year netting adjustment is $108.7 million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase is limited to $72.4 million. In October 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a settlement agreement reached with other parties resolving all issues in the proceeding. As a result of the settlement agreement, the total proposed revenue change is $82.2 million, including a $62.8 million increase for the projected 2022 year and a $19.4 million netting adjustment. Because Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s revenue requirement exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase is limited to $72.1 million. In December 2021 the APSC approved the settlement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2022. \n\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn July 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2022 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2023 calendar year. The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s earnings for the projected year 2023 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2021. The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2023 projected year is 7.40% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $104.8 million. The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2021 historical year was 8.38% resulting in a $15.2 million netting adjustment. The total proposed revenue change for the 2023 projected year and 2021 historical year netting adjustment is $119.9 million. By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s recovery of the revenue requirement was subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint. Because Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $79.3 million. In October 2022 other parties filed their testimony recommending various adjustments to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s overall proposed revenue deficiency, and Entergy Arkansas filed a response including an update to actual revenues through August 2022, which raised the constraint to $79.8 million. In November 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a settlement agreement reached with other parties resolving all issues in the \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nproceeding. As a result of the settlement agreement, the total revenue change was $102.8 million, including a $87.7 million increase for the 2023 projected year and a $15.2 million netting adjustment. Because Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s revenue requirement exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $79.8 million. In December 2022 the APSC approved the settlement agreement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2023. \n\nGreen Promise Renewable Tariff \n\nIn July 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a proposed green tariff designed to help participating customers meet their renewable and sustainability goals and to enhance economic development efforts in Arkansas. The total proposed amount of solar capacity requested to be available under this tariff was up to 200 MW. In September and October 2021 the APSC general staff and two net metering developer intervenors filed responses indicating opposition to the tariff as proposed. The tariff was supported by certain commercial and industrial customers that have indicated an interest in subscribing to the tariff. In October 2021, Entergy Arkansas, Walmart, and industrial customers filed a non-unanimous settlement agreement supporting that the tariff should be approved as filed by Entergy Arkansas; the Arkansas Attorney General stated it did not oppose the settlement. In January 2022 the APSC general staff filed in opposition to the non-unanimous settlement agreement, and one of the net metering developer intervenors withdrew from the proceeding. In January 2022 the parties agreed to a paper hearing with written responses to the APSC&#8217;s questions being filed in February and March 2022. In May 2022 the APSC found Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s proposal for the tariff to be just and reasonable for an initial offering of 100 MW of solar capacity, and in June 2022 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s compliance tariff filing. \n\nEnergy Cost Recovery Rider \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. The rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. \n\nIn January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in March 2014. In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate $65.9 million of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident. Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information was available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident. In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s request to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance. In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider. In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs and costs related to the incremental oversight previously noted, subject to certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement, including the resolution of civil litigation currently pending regarding the stator incident by the Circuit Court of Pope County, Arkansas. A trial date was established by the circuit court for March 1, 2023, but has been continued. In December 2022 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s request for an additional extension of the deadline for initiating a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds related to the stator incident to no later than sixty days after the circuit court issues a final order in the civil litigation proceedings. See the &#8220; ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews &#8221; section in Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ANO stator incident. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nIn March 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01164 per kWh to $0.01547 per kWh. The APSC staff filed testimony in March 2017 recommending that the redetermined rate be implemented with the first billing cycle of April 2017 under the normal operation of the tariff. Accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect on March 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff. In July 2017 the Arkansas Attorney General requested additional information to support certain of the costs included in Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s 2017 energy cost rate redetermination. \n\nIn March 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01547 per kWh to $0.01882 per kWh. The Arkansas Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s annual redetermination filing requesting that the APSC suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to refund. Among the reasons the Attorney General cited for suspension were questions pertaining to how Entergy Arkansas forecasted sales and potential implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Entergy Arkansas replied to the Attorney General&#8217;s filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider, those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination. Entergy Arkansas also stated that potential effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are appropriately considered in the APSC&#8217;s separate proceeding regarding potential implications of the tax law. The APSC general staff filed a reply to the Attorney General&#8217;s filing and agreed that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s filing complied with the terms of the energy cost recovery rider. The redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018. Subsequently in April 2018 the APSC issued an order declining to suspend Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s energy cost recovery rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the issues suggested by the Attorney General in the proceeding. Following a period of discovery, the Attorney General filed a supplemental response in October 2018 raising new issues with Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s March 2018 rate redetermination and asserting that $45.7 million of the increase should be collected subject to refund pending further investigation. Entergy Arkansas filed to dismiss the Attorney General&#8217;s supplemental response, the APSC general staff filed a motion to strike the Attorney General&#8217;s filing, and the Attorney General filed a supplemental response disputing Entergy Arkansas and the APSC staff&#8217;s filing. Applicable APSC rules and processes authorize its general staff to initiate periodic audits of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s energy cost recovery rider. In late-2018 the APSC general staff notified Entergy Arkansas it has initiated an audit of the 2017 fuel costs. The time in which the audit will be complete is uncertain at this time. \n\nIn March 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease from $0.01462 per kWh to $0.01052 per kWh. The redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2020 through the normal operation of the tariff. \n\nIn March 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease from $0.01052 per kWh to $0.00959 per kWh. The redetermined rate calculation also included an adjustment to account for a portion of the increased fuel costs resulting from the February 2021 winter storms. The redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2021 through the normal operation of the tariff. \n\nIn March 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase from $0.00959 per kWh to $0.01785 per kWh. The primary reason for the rate increase is a large under-recovered balance as a result of higher natural gas prices in 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter 2021. At the request of the APSC general staff, Entergy Arkansas deferred its request for recovery of $32 million from the under-recovery related to the 2021 February winter storms until the 2023 energy cost rate redetermination, unless a request for an interim adjustment to the energy cost recovery rider is necessary. This resulted in a redetermined rate of $0.016390 per kWh, which became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2022 through the normal operation of the tariff. In February 2023 the APSC issued orders initiating proceedings with the utilities to address the prudence of costs incurred and appropriate cost allocation of the 2021 February winter storms. With respect to any prudence review of Entergy Arkansas fuel costs, as part of the APSC&#8217;s \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ndraft report issued in its 2021 February winter storm investigation docket, the APSC included findings that the load shedding plans of the investor-owned utilities and some cooperatives were appropriate and comprehensive, and, further, that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s emergency plan was comprehensive and had a multilayered approach supported by a system-wide response plan, which is considered an industry standard. \n\nOpportunity Sales Proceeding \n\nIn June 2009 the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocated the energy generated by Entergy System resources; (b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies. The LPSC&#8217;s complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds. In July 2009 the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint arguing among other things that the System Agreement contemplates that the Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company. The FERC subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding. \n\nAfter a hearing, the ALJ issued an initial decision in December 2010. The ALJ found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. The ALJ concluded that &#8220;shareholders&#8221; should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along with interest. Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ&#8217;s initial decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision. \n\nThe FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. The FERC found, however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different allocation authority. The FERC further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the System Agreement. The FERC in its decision established further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the FERC&#8217;s June 2012 decision. The hearing was held in May 2013 and the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013. The LPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. Entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that the FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff. \n\nIn April 2016 the FERC issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed in July 2012 and the ALJ&#8217;s August 2013 initial decision. The first order denied Entergy&#8217;s request for rehearing and affirmed the FERC&#8217;s earlier rulings that Entergy&#8217;s original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, Entergy Arkansas must make payments to the other Utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation. The FERC clarified that interest should be included with the payments. The second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the ALJ&#8217;s August 2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility operating companies. The FERC affirmed the ALJ&#8217;s ruling that a full re-run of intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy allocation as joint account sales. The FERC reversed the ALJ&#8217;s decision that any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by 20%. The FERC also reversed the ALJ&#8217;s decision that adjustments to other System Agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by Entergy Arkansas. The FERC held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account but ordered further proceedings before an ALJ to address \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nwhether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology. \n\nIn May 2016, Entergy Services filed a request for rehearing of the FERC&#8217;s April 2016 order arguing that payments made by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced as a result of the timing of the LPSC&#8217;s approval of certain contracts. Entergy Services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the FERC&#8217;s April 2016 order addressing the ALJ&#8217;s August 2013 initial decision. The APSC and the LPSC also filed requests for rehearing of the FERC&#8217;s April 2016 order. In September 2017 the FERC issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue of whether any payments by Entergy Arkansas to the other Utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the LPSC&#8217;s approval of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s wholesale baseload contract with Entergy Louisiana. In November 2017 the FERC issued an order denying all of the remaining requests for rehearing of the April 2016 order. In November 2017, Entergy Services filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of the FERC&#8217;s orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case. In December 2017 the D.C. Circuit granted Entergy Services&#8217; request to hold the appeal in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC. In January 2018 the APSC and the LPSC filed separate petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals with Entergy Services&#8217; appeal. \n\nThe hearing required by the FERC&#8217;s April 2016 order was held in May 2017. In July 2017 the ALJ issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology. In August 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, and FERC staff filed individual briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision. In September 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions taken by various parties. \n\nBased on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the April 2016 FERC orders, in the first quarter 2016, Entergy Arkansas recorded a liability of $87 million, which included interest, for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other Utility operating companies, and a deferred fuel regulatory asset of $75 million. Following its assessment of the course of the proceedings, including the FERC&#8217;s denial of rehearing in November 2017 described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, Entergy Arkansas recorded an additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31 million. \n\nIn October 2018 the FERC issued an order addressing the ALJ&#8217;s July 2017 initial decision. The FERC reversed the ALJ&#8217;s decision to cap the reduction in Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments that Entergy Arkansas made to the other operating companies. The FERC also reversed the ALJ&#8217;s decision that Grand Gulf sales from January through September 2000 should be included in the calculation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s payment. The FERC affirmed on other grounds the ALJ&#8217;s rejection of the LPSC&#8217;s claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the calculation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s payment. In November 2018 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC&#8217;s October 2018 decision. In December 2019 the FERC denied the LPSC&#8217;s request for rehearing. In January 2020 the LPSC appealed the December 2019 decision to the D.C. Circuit. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nIn December 2018, Entergy made a compliance filing in response to the FERC&#8217;s October 2018 order. The compliance filing provided a final calculation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s payments to the other Utility operating companies, including interest. No protests were filed in response to the December 2018 compliance filing. Refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by Entergy Arkansas to the other operating companies in December 2018: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Total refunds including interest Payment/(Receipt) &#160; (In Millions) Principal Interest Total Entergy Arkansas $68 $67 $135 Entergy Louisiana ($30) ($29) ($59) Entergy Mississippi ($18) ($18) ($36) Entergy New Orleans ($3) ($4) ($7) Entergy Texas ($17) ($16) ($33) ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of $116 million as of December 31, 2018 for a portion of the payments due as a result of this proceeding. \n\nAs described above, the FERC&#8217;s opportunity sales orders have been appealed to the D.C. Circuit. In February 2020 all of the appeals were consolidated and in April 2020 the D.C. Circuit established a briefing schedule. Briefing was completed in September 2020 and oral argument was heard in December 2020. In July 2021 the D.C. Circuit issued a decision denying all of the petitions for review filed in response to the FERC&#8217;s opportunity sales orders. \n\nIn February 2019 the LPSC filed a new complaint relating to two issues that were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its October 2018 order, the FERC held were outside the scope of the proceeding. In March 2019, Entergy Services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint. In November 2019 the FERC issued an order denying the LPSC&#8217;s complaint. The order concluded that the settlement agreement approved by the FERC in December 2015 terminating the System Agreement barred the LPSC&#8217;s new complaint. In December 2019 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC&#8217;s November 2019 order, and in July 2020 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC&#8217;s request for rehearing. In September 2020 the LPSC appealed to the D.C. Circuit the FERC&#8217;s orders dismissing the new opportunity sales complaint. In November 2020 the D.C. Circuit issued an order establishing that briefing will occur in January 2021 through April 2021. Oral argument was held in September 2021. In December 2021 the D.C. Circuit denied the LPSC&#8217;s Petition for Review of the new opportunity sales complaint. The opportunity sales cases are complete at FERC and at the D.C. Circuit and no additional refund amounts are owed by Entergy Arkansas. \n\nIn May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony with the APSC requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period. The application requested that the APSC approve the rider to take effect within 30 days or, if suspended by the APSC as allowed by commission rule, approve the rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring 30 days after issuance of the APSC&#8217;s order approving the rider. In June 2019 the APSC suspended Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s tariff and granted Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s motion asking the APSC to establish the proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC&#8217;s October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding. In January 2020 the APSC adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2020. In January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a joint motion seeking to dismiss Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application alleging that the APSC, in a prior proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the application and determined that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s requested relief violates the filed rate doctrine and the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking. Entergy Arkansas responded to the joint motion in February 2020 rebutting these \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\narguments, including demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding differ substantially from those the APSC addressed previously and that the payment resulting from a FERC tariff violation for which Entergy Arkansas seeks retail cost recovery in this proceeding differs materially from the refunds resulting from a FERC tariff amendment that the APSC previously rejected on filed rate doctrine and the retroactive ratemaking grounds. In addition, in January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed testimony opposing the recovery by Entergy Arkansas of the opportunity sales payment but also claiming that certain components of the payment should be segregated and refunded to customers. In March 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed rebuttal testimony. \n\nIn July 2020 the APSC issued a decision finding that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application is not in the public interest. The order also directed Entergy Arkansas to refund to its retail customers within 30 days of the order the FERC-determined over-collection of $13.7 million, plus interest, associated with a recalculated bandwidth remedy. In addition to these primary findings, the order also denied the Attorney General&#8217;s request for Entergy Arkansas to prepare a compliance filing detailing all of the retail impacts from the opportunity sales and denied a request by the Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers to recalculate all costs using the revised responsibility ratio. Entergy Arkansas filed a motion for temporary stay of the 30-day requirement to allow Entergy Arkansas a reasonable opportunity to seek rehearing of the APSC order, but in July 2020 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s request for a stay and directed Entergy Arkansas to refund to its retail customers the component of the total FERC-determined opportunity sales payment that was associated with increased bandwidth remedy payments of $13.7 million, plus interest. The refunds were issued in the August 2020 billing cycle. While the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s stay request, Entergy Arkansas believes its actions were prudent and, therefore, the costs, including the $13.7 million, plus interest, are recoverable. In July 2020, Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the APSC order, which rehearing was denied by the APSC in August 2020. In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas challenging the APSC&#8217;s order denying Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s request to recover the costs of these payments. In October 2020 the APSC filed a motion to dismiss Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s complaint, to which Entergy Arkansas responded. Also in December 2020, Entergy Arkansas and the APSC held a pre-trial conference, and filed a report with the court in January 2021. The court held a hearing in February 2021 regarding issues addressed in the pre-trial conference report, and in June 2021 the court stayed all discovery until it rules on pending motions, after which the court will issue an amended schedule if necessary. In March 2022 the court denied the APSC&#8217;s motion to dismiss, and, in April 2022, issued a scheduling order including a trial date in February 2023. In June 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion asserting that it is entitled to summary judgment because Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s position that the APSC&#8217;s order is pre-empted by the filed rate doctrine and violates the Dormant Commerce Clause is premised on facts that are not subject to genuine dispute. In July 2022, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc., an industrial customer association, filed a motion to intervene and to hold Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s motion for summary judgment in abeyance pending a ruling on the motion to intervene. Entergy Arkansas filed a consolidated opposition to both motions. In August 2022 the APSC filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the APSC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In September 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed an opposition to the motion. In October 2022 the APSC filed a motion asking the court to hold further proceedings in abeyance pending a decision on the motions for summary judgment filed by Entergy Arkansas and the APSC. Also in October 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed an opposition to the motion, and the APSC filed a reply in support of its motion for summary judgment. In January 2023 the judge assigned to the case, on her own motion, identified facts that may present a conflict and recused herself; a new judge was assigned to the case, but he also recused due to a conflict. The case again was reassigned to a new judge. In January 2023 the court denied all pending motions (including those described above) except for a motion by the APSC to exclude certain testimony and further ruled that the matter would proceed to trial. In January 2023, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a notice of appeal of the court&#8217;s order denying its motion to intervene to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and a motion with the district court to stay the proceedings pending the appeal, which was denied. In February 2023, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth District to stay the proceedings pending the appeal, which also was denied. The trial was held in February 2023. Following the trial, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth District \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nto expedite the appeal filed by Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. The court granted Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s request. \n\nNet Metering Legislation \n\nAn Arkansas law was enacted effective July 2019 that, among other things, expands the definition of a &#8220;net metering customer&#8221; to include two additional types of customers: (1) customers that lease net metering facilities, subject to certain leasing arrangements, and (2) government entities or other entities exempt from state and federal income taxes that enter into a service contract for a net metering facility. The latter provision allows eligible entities, many of whom are small and large general service customers, to purchase renewable energy directly from third party providers and receive bill credits for these purchases. The APSC was given authority under this law to address certain matters, such as cost shifting and the appropriate compensation for net metered energy and initiated proceedings for this purpose. Because of the size and number of customers eligible under this new law, there is a risk of loss of load and the shifting of costs to customers. A hearing was held in December 2019, with utilities, including Entergy Arkansas, cooperatives, the Arkansas Attorney General, and industrial customers advocating the need for establishment of a reasonable rate structure that takes into account impacts to non-net metering customers; an additional hearing was conducted in February 2020 for purposes of public comment only. The APSC issued an order in June 2020, and in July 2020 several parties, including Entergy Arkansas, filed for rehearing on multiple grounds, including for the reasons that it imposes an unreasonable rate structure and allows facilities to net meter that do not meet the statutory definition of net metering facilities. After granting the rehearing requests, the APSC issued an order in September 2020 largely upholding its June 2020 order. In October 2020, Entergy Arkansas and several other parties filed an appeal of the APSC&#8217;s September 2020 order. In January 2021, Entergy Arkansas, pursuant to an APSC order, filed an updated net metering tariff, which was approved in February 2021. In May 2021, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to dismiss its pending judicial appeal of the APSC&#8217;s September 2020 order on rehearing in the proceeding addressing its net metering rules. In June 2021 the Arkansas Court of Appeals granted the motion and dismissed Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s appeal, although other appeals of the September 2020 APSC order remained before the court. In May 2022 the court issued an order affirming the APSC&#8217;s decision in part and reversing in part. In June 2022 the APSC sought rehearing from the court with respect to the court&#8217;s ruling on a grid charge, which the court of appeals denied in July 2022. One of the cooperative appellants filed a further appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court in July 2022, which the court decided not to hear. \n\nSeparately, as directed by the APSC general staff, the APSC opened a proceeding to compel utilities to amend their net metering tariffs to incorporate the provisions of the legislation that the APSC general staff considered &#8220;black letter law.&#8221; Entergy Arkansas, the Arkansas Attorney General, and other intervenors opposed this directive pending the development of the rules for implementation that are being considered in the separate net metering rulemaking docket. Nevertheless, reserving its rights, Entergy Arkansas has complied with the directive to amend its tariffs. Asserting procedural and due process violations, in January 2020, Entergy Arkansas and the Arkansas Attorney General separately appealed certain APSC orders in the proceeding. In December 2021 the Arkansas Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds and without prejudice. \n\nSince the enactment of the net metering legislation, the APSC has approved numerous applications allowing Entergy Arkansas customers to enter into purchase power agreements with third parties and to utilize these purchase power agreements to offset power usage by Entergy Arkansas, despite the lack of proximity between the purchase power agreement and the end-use customer. The APSC also has allowed the aggregation of accounts by net metering customers. These decisions by the APSC have created subsidies in favor of eligible net metering customers to the detriment of non-participating customers. The level of this subsidy continues to grow as additional net metering applications are approved by the APSC. \n\nIn September 2022 the APSC opened a rulemaking concerning proposed amendments to the net metering rules to address the expiration on December 31, 2022 of the automatic grandfathering of the existing net metering rate structure. Entergy Arkansas and other utility parties filed initial briefs and comments setting forth that the statute imposing the expiration of the automatic grandfathering is not ambiguous and that the APSC does not have \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nthe authority to extend the grandfathering period, and the hearing was held in October 2022. In December 2022 the APSC issued an order attempting to modify the net metering rules and purporting to allow for the potential for grandfathering after December 31, 2022. More than thirty applicants filed individual net metering applications in December 2022 seeking to be considered under the APSC&#8217;s order, although the APSC issued an order in January 2023 holding those applications in abeyance. Several parties, including Entergy Arkansas, sought rehearing, and the Arkansas&#8217;s Governor&#8217;s executive order limiting new rulemakings calls into question how the APSC&#8217;s order to adopt new rules may be effectuated. \n\nAlso in September 2022 the APSC opened another proceeding to investigate the issue of potential cost shifting arising as a result of net metering. Investor owned utilities and some cooperatives were required to make and did make filings in October 2022 with supporting documentation as to the amount and extent of cost shifting and the manner in which they would design tariffs to recover those costs on behalf of non-net metering customers. Responses to the utility and cooperative filings were filed in January 2023, and utilities filed their further responses in February 2023. \n\nCOVID-19 Orders \n\nIn April 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the APSC issued an order requiring utilities, to the extent they had not already done so, to suspend service disconnections during the remaining pendency of the Arkansas Governor&#8217;s emergency declaration or until the APSC rescinds the directive. The order also authorized utilities to establish a regulatory asset to record costs resulting from the suspension of service disconnections, directed that in future proceedings the APSC will consider whether the request for recovery of these regulatory assets is reasonable and necessary, and required utilities to track and report the costs and any savings directly attributable to suspension of disconnects. In May 2020 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas expanding deferred payment agreements to assist customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly reporting began in August 2020 and the APSC ordered additional reporting in October 2020 regarding utilities&#8217; transitional plans for ending the moratorium on service disconnects. In March 2021 the APSC issued an order confirming the lifting of the moratorium on service disconnects effective in May 2021. In August 2021 the APSC general staff filed a report recommending that utilities with a formula rate plan discontinue capturing any additional direct costs and savings as a regulatory asset and seek cost recovery through the formula rate plan. The APSC general staff further recommended that uncollectible amounts should be determined as of the end of its write-off period, approximately December 2021, and recovered in the next formula rate plan filing over one year. In November 2021 the APSC found the APSC general staff&#8217;s recommendation to be premature and asked utilities to report on the continued need for a regulatory asset. Entergy Arkansas reported a continued need for a regulatory asset due to a variety of factors including the unusually long terms of the customer delayed payment agreements. As of December 31, 2022, Entergy Arkansas had a regulatory asset of $39 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nRemaining Useful Lives Review \n\nIn response to recent legislation, the APSC opened a proceeding in December 2022 to establish a procedure to evaluate life extensions of all utility generation units and opened a separate docket to evaluate life extensions for White Bluff, Independence, and Lake Catherine. In January 2023, Entergy Arkansas and one other party filed for rehearing of the order in the general proceeding, and Entergy Arkansas moved to dismiss the separate docket. In February 2023 the APSC granted rehearing in the general proceeding. For additional discussion related to these plants, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation - National Ambient Air Quality Standards - Regional Haze&#8221; in Part I, Item 1. \n\nFederal Regulation \n\nSee the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#8211; Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nNuclear Matters \n\nEntergy Arkansas owns and, through an affiliate, operates the ANO 1 and 2 nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants including the financial requirements to address emerging issues related to equipment reliability; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. ANO 1&#8217;s operating license expires in 2034 and ANO 2&#8217;s operating license expires in 2038. \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. \n\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs \n\nSee &#8220; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. \n\nUtility Regulatory Accounting \n\nSee &#8220; Utility Regulatory Accounting &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nSee &#8220; Impairment of Long-lived Assets &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nSee &#8220; Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. \n\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEntergy Arkansas&#8217;s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See &#8220; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy&#8217;s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. \n\nCosts and Sensitivities \n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on 2022 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $1,301 $26,969 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $2,600 $&#8212; Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $1,081 $5,122 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on 2022 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $78 $4,097 Health care cost trend 0.25% $287 $3,365 ##TABLE_END\n\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nCosts and Employer Contributions \n\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2022 was $74.8 million, including $36.4 million in settlement costs. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2023 qualified pension cost to be $34.1 million. Entergy Arkansas contributed $93 million to its qualified pension plans in 2022 and estimates pension contributions will be approximately $54.5 million in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. \n\nTotal other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Arkansas in 2022 was $5.7 million. Entergy Arkansas expects 2023 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $1.9 million. Entergy Arkansas contributed $1.6 million to its other postretirement plans in 2022 and estimates 2023 contributions will be approximately $526 thousand. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nSee &#8220; Other Contingencies &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee &#8220; New Accounting Pronouncements &#8221; section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the member and Board of Directors of \n\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in equity (pages 340 through 344 and applicable items in pages 53 through 245), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRate and Regulatory Matters &#8212;Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Arkansas Public Service Commission (the &#8220;APSC&#8221;), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Arkansas, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the APSC and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the APSC and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs, including costs related to the Opportunity Sales Proceeding and refunds to customers. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the APSC and the FERC, involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the APSC and the FERC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the APSC and the FERC for the Company, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the APSC&#8217;s and the FERC&#8217;s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, including the Opportunity Sales Proceeding, we inspected the Company&#8217;s filings with the APSC and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan filing, and considered the filings with the APSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company&#8217;s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management&#8217;s assertions . \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order, including the Opportunity Sales Proceeding, to assess management&#8217;s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2001. \n\n##TABLE_START ENTERGY ARKANSAS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS &#160;

##TABLE_END\n\nENTERGY LOUISIANA, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \n\nResults of Operations \n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nNet Income \n\nNet income increased $201.9 million primarily due to the net effects of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s storm cost securitization, including a $290 million reduction in income tax expense, partially offset by a $224.4 million ($165.4 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge to reflect its obligation to share the benefits of the securitization with customers. Also contributing to the net income increase was higher volume/weather and higher retail electric price, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, lower other income, higher interest expense, and higher taxes other than income taxes. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the securitization. \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nFollowing is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2022 to 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Amount &#160; (In Millions) 2021 operating revenues $5,068.4 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income 1,013.0 Retail electric price 111.7 Volume/weather 108.2 Storm restoration carrying costs 37.5 2022 operating revenues $6,338.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. &#8220;Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income&#8221; includes the revenue variance associated with these items. \n\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan revenues, including increases in the distribution and transmission recovery mechanisms, effective September 2021 and September 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan proceedings. \n\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,934 GWh, or 5%, in electricity usage across all customer classes, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. The increase in commercial usage was primarily due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in 2021. The increase in industrial usage was primarily due to an increase in demand from expansion projects, primarily in the chemicals, petroleum refining, and transportation industries, an increase in demand from cogeneration and small industrial customers, and an increase in demand from existing customers, primarily in the chemicals and pulp and paper industries as a result of prior year temporary plant shutdowns. The increased usage from these industrial customers has a relatively smaller effect on operating revenues because a larger portion of the revenues from those customers comes from fixed charges. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nStorm restoration carrying costs represent the equity component of storm restoration carrying costs, recorded in second quarter 2022, recognized as part of the securitization of the Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, Winter Storm Uri, and Hurricane Ida restoration costs in May 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the securitization. \n\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Louisiana for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 % Change (GWh) Residential 14,119 13,445 5 Commercial 10,927 10,388 5 Industrial 31,666 29,978 6 Governmental 820 787 4 Total retail 57,532 54,598 5 Sales for resale: Associated companies 5,416 4,950 9 Non-associated companies 3,423 2,764 24 Total 66,371 62,312 7 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s operating revenues. \n\nOther Income Statement Variances \n\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $27.7 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance costs, higher reliability costs, and higher safety and training costs, partially offset by a decrease in meter reading expenses as a result of the deployment of advanced metering systems; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $19 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2022 as compared to 2021 and higher nuclear labor costs; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $10.3 million in bad debt expense, primarily due to the deferral in 2021 of bad debt expense resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of regulatory activity associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $9.8 million due to a $14.8 million gain on the sale of a pipeline recorded in 2021 as compared to a $5 million contingent gain recorded on the 2021 sale in 2022; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $7.5 million in customer service center support costs primarily due to higher contract costs; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $6.6 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher costs associated with materials and supplies in 2022 as compared to 2021; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $5.1 million in loss provisions; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $4.8 million in energy efficiency expenses due to the timing of recovery from customers, partially offset by lower energy efficiency costs; and \n\n&#8226; several individually insignificant items. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in franchise taxes, increases in employment taxes, and increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes a regulatory charge of $224 million, recorded in second quarter 2022, to reflect Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s obligation to provide credits to its customers in recognition of obligations related to an LPSC ancillary order issued in the Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, Winter Storm Uri, and Hurricane Ida securitization regulatory proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the securitization. In addition, Entergy Louisiana records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation related costs collected in revenue. \n\nOther income decreased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; changes in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of the decommissioning trust funds in 2022 and 2021; and \n\n&#8226; a $31.6 million charge for the LURC&#8217;s 1% beneficial interest in the storm trust established as part of the Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, Winter Storm Uri, and Hurricane Ida securitization. \n\nThe decrease was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $58.2 million in affiliated dividend income resulting from the storm trust&#8217;s investment of securitization proceeds in affiliated preferred membership interests, partially offset by the liquidation of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s investment in affiliated preferred membership interests acquired in connection with previous securitizations of storm restoration costs; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $16.8 million due to the recognition of storm restoration carrying costs, primarily related to Hurricane Ida. \n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the securitization. \n\nInterest expense increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; the issuances of $500 million of 2.35% Series mortgage bonds and $500 million of 3.10% Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2021; \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $1 billion of 0.95% Series mortgage bonds in October 2021; \n\n&#8226; the $1.2 billion unsecured term loan drawn in January 2022. The term loan was repaid in June 2022; and \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $500 million of 4.75% Series mortgage bonds in August 2022. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by the repayment of $200 million of 4.8% Series mortgage bonds in May 2021. \n\nThe effective income tax rates were (23.5%) for 2022 and 15.5% for 2021. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nIncome Tax Legislation \n\nSee the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow \n\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $18,573 $728,020 $2,006 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,177,508 1,052,526 1,072,986 Investing activities (4,707,711) (3,700,199) (1,944,671) Financing activities 3,568,243 1,938,226 1,597,699 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 38,040 (709,447) 726,014 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $56,613 $18,573 $728,020 ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $125 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $221.9 million in storm spending, primarily due to Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta restoration efforts in 2021; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $64 million in income tax refunds in 2022 as a result of an intercompany income tax allocation agreement; and \n\n&#8226; higher collections from customers. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; increased fuel costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $23.5 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $15.8 million in interest paid in 2022; and \n\n&#8226; payments to vendors, including timing and an increase in cost of operations. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $1,007.5 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase in investments in affiliates due to the $3,163.6 million purchase by the storm trust of preferred membership interests issued by an Entergy affiliate, partially offset by the $1,390.6 million redemption of preferred membership interests. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the securitization; \n\n&#8226; net payments to storm reserve escrow accounts of $293.4 million in 2022; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $100.4 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to increased spending on various nuclear projects in 2022 and higher capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $23.1 million in non-nuclear generation construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work on projects performed in 2022 as compared to 2021, including during plant outages; \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n&#8226; an increase of $13.3 million in information technology capital expenditures primarily due to increased spending on various technology projects in 2022; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $12.2 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity, primarily due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, materials and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $856.2 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022 and lower spending in 2022 on advanced metering infrastructure, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s service area, and increased investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s distribution system; \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $328.5 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022; \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $25.3 million in nuclear decommissioning trust fund activity as a result of a lump sum contribution in 2021 for amounts collected over a 17-month period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of nuclear decommissioning expense recovery; and \n\n&#8226; money pool activity. \n\nDecreases in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s receivables from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s receivable from the money pool decreased $14.5 million in 2022 compared to increasing by $1.1 million in 2021. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries&#8217; need for external short-term borrowings. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities increased $1,630 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; proceeds from securitization of $3.2 billion received by the storm trust in 2022; \n\n&#8226; a capital contribution of $1 billion received indirectly from Entergy Corporation in May 2022 to finance the establishment of the storm escrow account for Hurricane Ida costs; \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $500 million of 4.75% Series mortgage bonds in August 2022; \n\n&#8226; money pool activity; \n\n&#8226; the repayment, at maturity, of $200 million of 4.80% Series mortgage bonds in May 2021; \n\n&#8226; the repayment, at maturity, of Entergy Louisiana Waterford VIE&#8217;s $40 million of 3.92% Series H secured notes in February 2021; and \n\n&#8226; higher prepaid deposits of $32 million related to contributions-in-aid-of-construction reimbursement agreements in 2022 as compared to 2021. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $500 million of 2.35% Series mortgage bonds and $500 million of 3.10% Series mortgage bonds, each in March 2021; \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $1 billion of 0.95% Series mortgage bonds in October 2021; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $564 million in common equity distributions in 2022 primarily to return to Entergy Corporation the $125 million capital contribution received in December 2021 to assist in paying for costs associated with Hurricane Ida and to maintain Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s targeted capital structure; \n\n&#8226; the repayment, prior to maturity, in May 2022 of $435 million, a portion of the outstanding principal, of 0.62% Series mortgage bonds due November 2023; \n\n&#8226; the repayment, at maturity, of $200 million of 3.3% Series mortgage bonds in December 2022; \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n&#8226; net repayments of $75 million in 2022 compared to net borrowings of $125 million in 2021 on Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s revolving credit facility; \n\n&#8226; a capital contribution of $125 million received from Entergy Corporation in December 2021 in order to assist in paying costs associated with Hurricane Ida; and \n\n&#8226; net repayments of long-term borrowings of $8.4 million in 2022 compared to net long-term borrowings of $24.1 million in 2021 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities&#8217; credit facilities. \n\nIncreases in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s payable to the money pool increased $226.1 million in 2022. \n\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The decrease in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Louisiana is primarily due to the $1.0 billion capital contribution received indirectly from Entergy Corporation in May 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt to capital 53.0 % 57.2 % Effect of subtracting cash (0.1 %) 0.0 % Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 52.9 % 57.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Entergy Louisiana also uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nEntergy Louisiana seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Louisiana may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy Louisiana may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nUses of Capital \n\nEntergy Louisiana requires capital resources for: \n\n&#8226; construction and other capital investments; \n\n&#8226; debt maturities or retirements; \n\n&#8226; working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and \n\n&#8226; distribution and interest payments. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s planned construction and other capital investments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 &#160; (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment: &#160; &#160; Generation $405 $435 $1,305 Transmission 245 545 490 Distribution 445 545 635 Utility Support 175 110 120 Total $1,270 $1,635 $2,550 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana includes specific investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s portfolio, including the St. Jacques Facility; investments in River Bend and Waterford 3; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to drive reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. \n\nWhile Entergy Louisiana is still assessing the effect on its planned solar projects, the investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce into potential circumvention of duties and tariffs may result in increased duties or tariffs on imported solar panels and has exacerbated previously existing supply chain disruptions, which have negatively affected the timing and cost of completion of these projects. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026-2027 After 2027 &#160; (In Millions) Long-term debt (a) $1,362 $2,029 $655 $1,733 $10,288 Operating leases (b) $15 $12 $10 $10 $2 Finance leases (b) $5 $4 $4 $5 $2 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. \n\n(b) Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nEntergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $44.6 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $15.4 million to its other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ncompleted, which is expected by April 1, 2023. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. \n\nEntergy Louisiana has $21.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nIn addition, Entergy Louisiana enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations. Entergy Louisiana has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and the Vidalia purchased power agreement. \n\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. \n\n2021 Solar Certification and the Geaux Green Option \n\nIn November 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification of and approval for the addition of four new solar photovoltaic resources with a combined nameplate capacity of 475 megawatts (the 2021 Solar Portfolio) and the implementation of a new green tariff, the Geaux Green Option (Rider GGO). The 2021 Solar Portfolio consists of four resources that are expected to provide $242 million in net benefits to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s customers. These resources, all of which would be constructed in Louisiana, include (i) the Vacherie Facility, a 150 megawatt resource in St. James Parish; (ii) the Sunlight Road Facility, a 50 megawatt resource in Washington Parish; (iii) the St. Jacques Facility, a 150 megawatt resource in St. James Parish; and (iv) the Elizabeth Facility, a 125 megawatt resource in Allen Parish. The St. Jacques Facility would be acquired through a build-own-transfer agreement; the remaining resources involve power purchase agreements. The Sunlight Road Facility and the Elizabeth Facility have estimated in service dates in 2024, and the Vacherie Facility and the St. Jacques Facility have estimated in service dates in 2025. The filing proposed to recover the costs of the power purchase agreements through the fuel adjustment clause and the formula rate plan and the acquisition costs through the formula rate plan. \n\nThe proposed Rider GGO is a voluntary rate schedule that will enhance Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s ability to help customers meet their sustainability goals by allowing customers to align some or all of their electricity requirements with renewable energy from the resources. Because subscription fees from Rider GGO participants would help to offset the cost of the resources, the design of Rider GGO also preserves the benefits of the 2021 Solar Portfolio for non-participants by providing them with the reliability and capacity benefits of locally-sited solar generation at a discounted price. \n\nIn March 2022 direct testimony from Walmart, the Louisiana Energy Users Group (LEUG), and the LPSC staff was filed. Each party recommended that the LPSC approve the resources proposed in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s application, and the LPSC staff witness indicated that the process through which Entergy Louisiana solicited or obtained the proposals for the resources complied with applicable LPSC orders. The LPSC staff and LEUG&#8217;s witnesses made recommendations to modify the proposed Rider GGO and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s proposed rate relief. In April 2022 the LPSC staff and LEUG filed cross-answering testimony concerning each other&#8217;s proposed modifications to Rider GGO and the proposed rate recovery. Entergy Louisiana filed rebuttal testimony in June 2022. In August 2022 the parties reached a settlement certifying the 2021 Solar Portfolio and approving implementation of Rider GGO. In September 2022 the LPSC approved the settlement. Following the LPSC approval, the St. James Parish council issued a moratorium on new land use permits for solar facilities until the later \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nof March 2023 or the completion of an environmental and economic impact study, which is ongoing. This development may potentially affect the size and final in service dates of the Vacherie and St. Jacques facilities. \n\nSystem Resilience and Storm Hardening \n\nIn December 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking a public interest finding regarding Phase I of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s Future Ready resilience plan and approval of a rider mechanism to recover the program&#8217;s costs. Phase I reflects the first five years of a ten-year resilience plan and includes investment of approximately $5 billion, including hardening investment, transmission dead-end structures, enhanced vegetation management, and telecommunications improvement. A procedural schedule has not yet been adopted in this docket. \n\nSources of Capital \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s sources to meet its capital requirements include: \n\n&#8226; internally generated funds; \n\n&#8226; cash on hand; \n\n&#8226; the Entergy System money pool; \n\n&#8226; storm reserve escrow accounts; \n\n&#8226; debt or preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; capital contributions; and \n\n&#8226; bank financing under new or existing facilities. \n\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit. \n\nAll debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 (In Thousands) ($226,114) $14,539 $13,426 ($82,826) ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. \n\nEntergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $350 million scheduled to expire in June 2027. The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $15 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2022, there were $50 million of cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, Entergy Louisiana is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO. As of December 31, 2022, $20 million in letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s uncommitted letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nThe Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entities have two separate credit facilities, each in the amount of $105 million and scheduled to expire in June 2025. As of December 31, 2022, $13.1 million of loans were outstanding under the credit facility for the Entergy Louisiana River Bend nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. As of December 31, 2022, $60.8 million in loans were outstanding under the Entergy Louisiana Waterford nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facilities. \n\nEntergy Louisiana had $293.4 million in its storm reserve escrow account at December 31, 2022. \n\nEntergy Louisiana obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2023 for the following: \n\n&#8226; short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $450 million at any time outstanding; \n\n&#8226; long-term borrowings and security issuances; and \n\n&#8226; borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entities. \n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s short-term borrowing limits. \n\nHurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, Winter Storm Uri, and Hurricane Ida \n\nIn August 2020 and October 2020, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta caused significant damage to portions of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s service area. The storms resulted in widespread outages, significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the outages. Additionally, as a result of Hurricane Laura&#8217;s extensive damage to the grid infrastructure serving the impacted area, large portions of the underlying transmission system required nearly a complete rebuild. \n\nIn October 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an application at the LPSC seeking approval of certain ratemaking adjustments in connection with the issuance of shorter-term mortgage bonds to provide interim financing for restoration costs associated with Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta. Subsequently, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed a joint motion seeking approval to exclude from the derivation of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s capital structure and cost rate of debt for ratemaking purposes, including the allowance for funds used during construction, shorter-term debt up to $1.1 billion issued by Entergy Louisiana to fund costs associated with Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta costs on an interim basis. In November 2020 the LPSC issued an order approving the joint motion, and Entergy Louisiana issued $1.1 billion of 0.62% Series mortgage bonds due November 2023. Also in November 2020, Entergy Louisiana withdrew $257 million from its funded storm reserves. \n\nIn February 2021 two winter storms (collectively, Winter Storm Uri) brought freezing rain and ice to Louisiana. Ice accumulation sagged or downed trees, limbs, and power lines, causing damage to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s transmission and distribution systems. The additional weight of ice caused trees and limbs to fall into power lines and other electric equipment. When the ice melted, it affected vegetation and electrical equipment, causing additional outages. As discussed in the &#8220; Fuel and purchased power recovery &#8221; section of Note 2 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana recovered the incremental fuel costs associated with Winter Storm Uri over a five-month period from April 2021 through August 2021. \n\nIn April 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC relating to Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, and Winter Storm Uri restoration costs and in July 2021, Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing updating the total restoration costs. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric facilities damaged by these storms were estimated to be approximately $2.06 billion, including approximately $1.68 billion in capital costs and approximately $380 million in non-capital costs. Including carrying costs through January 2022, Entergy Louisiana sought an LPSC determination that $2.11 billion was prudently incurred and, therefore, was eligible for recovery from customers. Additionally, Entergy Louisiana requested that the LPSC determine that re-establishment of a storm escrow account to the previously authorized \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\namount of $290 million was appropriate. In July 2021, Entergy Louisiana supplemented the application with a request regarding the financing and recovery of the recoverable storm restoration costs. Specifically, Entergy Louisiana requested approval to securitize its restoration costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 55 financing, as supplemented by Act 293 of the Louisiana Legislature&#8217;s Regular Session of 2021. \n\nIn August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused extensive damage to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission systems resulting in widespread power outages. In September 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an application at the LPSC seeking approval of certain ratemaking adjustments in connection with the issuance of approximately $1 billion of shorter-term mortgage bonds to provide interim financing for restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ida, which bonds were issued in October 2021. Also in September 2021, Entergy Louisiana sought approval for the creation and funding of a $1 billion restricted escrow account for Hurricane Ida related restoration costs, subject to a subsequent prudence review. \n\nAfter filing of testimony by the LPSC staff and intervenors, which generally supported or did not oppose Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s requests in regard to Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, Winter Storm Uri, and Hurricane Ida, the parties negotiated and executed an uncontested stipulated settlement which was filed with the LPSC in February 2022. The settlement agreement contained the following key terms: $2.1 billion of restoration costs from Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, and Winter Storm Uri were prudently incurred and were eligible for recovery; carrying costs of $51 million were recoverable; a $290 million cash storm reserve should be re-established; a $1 billion reserve should be established to partially pay for Hurricane Ida restoration costs; and Entergy Louisiana was authorized to finance $3.186 billion utilizing the securitization process authorized by Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293. The LPSC issued an order approving the settlement in March 2022. As a result of the financing order, Entergy Louisiana reclassified $1.942 billion from utility plant to other regulatory assets. \n\nIn May 2022 the securitization financing closed, resulting in the issuance of $3.194 billion principal amount of bonds by Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA), a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana. The securitization was authorized pursuant to the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation Act, Part VIII of Chapter 9 of Title 45 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, as supplemented by Act 293 of the Louisiana legislature approved in 2021. The LCDA loaned the proceeds to the LURC. Pursuant to Act 293, the LURC contributed the net bond proceeds to a State legislatively authorized and LURC-sponsored trust, Restoration Law Trust I (the storm trust). \n\nPursuant to Act 293, the net proceeds of the bonds were used by the storm trust to purchase 31,635,718.7221 Class A preferred, non-voting membership interest units (the preferred membership interests) issued by Entergy Finance Company, LLC, a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Entergy. Entergy Finance Company is required to make annual distributions (dividends) commencing on December 15, 2022 on the preferred membership interests issued to the storm trust. These annual dividends received by the storm trust will be distributed to Entergy Louisiana and the LURC, as beneficiaries of the storm trust. Specifically, 1% of the annual dividends received by the storm trust will be distributed to the LURC, for the benefit of customers, and 99% will be distributed to Entergy Louisiana, net of storm trust expenses. The preferred membership interests have a stated annual cumulative cash dividend rate of 7% and a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The terms of the preferred membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Finance Company is subject. \n\nEntergy and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds issued by the LCDA on their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA. The bonds are secured by system restoration property, which is the right granted by law to the LURC to collect a system restoration charge from customers. The system restoration charge is adjusted at least semi-annually to ensure that it is sufficient to service the bonds. Entergy Louisiana collects the system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Louisiana began collecting the system restoration charge effective with the first billing cycle of June 2022 and the system restoration charge is expected to remain in place up to 15 years. Entergy and Entergy Louisiana do not report the collections as revenue because Entergy Louisiana is merely acting as a billing and collection agent for the LCDA and the LURC. In the remote possibility that the system restoration charge, as well as any funds in the \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nexcess subaccount and funds in the debt service reserve account, are insufficient to service the bonds resulting in a payment default, the storm trust is required to liquidate Entergy Finance Company preferred membership interests in an amount equal to what would be required to cure the default. The estimated value of this indirect guarantee is immaterial. \n\nFrom the proceeds from the issuance of the preferred membership interests, Entergy Finance Company distributed $1.4 billion to its parent, Entergy Holdings Company, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy. Subsequently, Entergy Holdings Company liquidated, distributing the $1.4 billion it received from Entergy Finance Company to Entergy Louisiana as holder of 6,843,780.24 units of Class A, 4,126,940.15 units of Class B, and 2,935,152.69 units of Class C preferred membership interests. Entergy Louisiana had acquired these preferred membership interests with proceeds from previous securitizations of storm restoration costs. Entergy Finance Company loaned the remaining $1.7 billion from the preferred membership interests proceeds to Entergy which used the cash to redeem $650 million of 4.00% Series senior notes due July 2022 and indirectly contributed $1 billion to Entergy Louisiana as a capital contribution. \n\nEntergy Louisiana used the $1 billion capital contribution to fund its Hurricane Ida escrow account and subsequently withdrew the $1 billion from the escrow account. With a portion of the $1 billion withdrawn from the escrow account and the $1.4 billion from the Entergy Holdings Company liquidation, Entergy Louisiana deposited $290 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for future storms, used $1.2 billion to repay its unsecured term loan due June 2023, and used $435 million to redeem a portion of its 0.62% Series mortgage bonds due November 2023. \n\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the securitization resulted in recognition of a reduction of income tax expense of approximately $290 million by Entergy Louisiana. Entergy&#8217;s recognition of reduced income tax expense was partially offset by other tax charges resulting in a net reduction of income tax expense of $283 million. I n recognition of obligations related to an LPSC ancillary order issued as part of the securitization regulatory proceeding, Entergy Louisiana recorded a $224 million ($165 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge and a corresponding regulatory liability to reflect its obligation to share the benefits of the securitization with customers. \n\nAs discussed in Note 17 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana consolidates the storm trust as a variable interest entity and the LURC&#8217;s 1% beneficial interest is shown as noncontrolling interest in the financial statements. In second quarter 2022, Entergy Louisiana recorded a charge of $31.6 million in other income to reflect the LURC&#8217;s beneficial interest in the trust. \n\nIn April 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC relating to Hurricane Ida restoration costs. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Ida currently are estimated to be approximately $2.54 billion, including approximately $1.96 billion in capital costs and approximately $586 million in non-capital costs. Including carrying costs of $57 million through December 2022, Entergy Louisiana is seeking an LPSC determination that $2.60 billion was prudently incurred and, therefore, is eligible for recovery from customers. As part of this filing, Entergy Louisiana also is seeking an LPSC determination that an additional $32 million in costs associated with the restoration of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta as well as Winter Storm Uri was prudently incurred. This amount is exclusive of the requested $3 million in carrying costs through December 2022. In total, Entergy Louisiana is requesting an LPSC determination that $2.64 billion was prudently incurred and, therefore, is eligible for recovery from customers. As discussed above, in March 2022 the LPSC approved financing of a $1 billion storm escrow account from which funds were withdrawn to finance costs associated with Hurricane Ida restoration. In June 2022, Entergy Louisiana supplemented the application with a request regarding the financing and recovery of the recoverable storm restoration costs. Specifically, Entergy Louisiana requested approval to securitize its restoration costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 55 financing, as supplemented by Act 293 of the Louisiana Legislature&#8217;s Regular Session of 2021. In October 2022 the LPSC staff recommended a finding that the requested storm restoration costs of $2.64 billion, including associated carrying costs of $59.1 million, were prudently incurred and are eligible for recovery from customers. The LPSC staff further recommended approval of \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s plans to securitize these costs, net of the $1 billion in funds withdrawn from the storm escrow account described above. The parties negotiated and executed an uncontested stipulated settlement which was filed with the LPSC in December 2022. The settlement agreement contains the following key terms: $2.57 billion of restoration costs from Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, and Winter Storm Uri were prudently incurred and were eligible for recovery; carrying costs of $59.2 million were recoverable; and Entergy Louisiana was authorized to finance $1.657 billion utilizing the securitization process authorized by Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293. A procedural motion to consider the uncontested settlement at the December 2022 LPSC meeting did not pass and the settlement was not voted on. In January 2023 an ALJ with the LPSC conducted a settlement hearing to receive the uncontested settlement and supporting testimony into evidence and issued a report of proceedings, which allows the LPSC to consider the uncontested settlement without the procedural motion that did not pass in December. In January 2023, the LPSC staff approved the stipulated settlement subject to certain modifications. These modifications include the recognition of accumulated deferred income tax benefits related to damaged assets and system restoration costs as a reduction of the amount authorized to be financed utilizing the securitization process authorized by Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293, from $1.657 billion to $1.491 billion. These modifications do not affect the staff&#8217;s conclusion that all system restoration costs sought by Entergy Louisiana were reasonable and prudent. The LPSC order is not yet final and non-appealable due to the forty-five day appeal period. In February 2023 the Louisiana Bond Commission voted to authorize the LCDA to issue the bonds authorized in the LPSC&#8217;s financing order; the bond rating and marketing process has yet to occur. \n\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery \n\nThe rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Louisiana is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. \n\nRetail Rates - Electric \n\nFilings with the LPSC \n\n2017 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn June 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2017 calendar year operations. The 2017 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on equity of 8.16%, due in large part to revenue-neutral realignments to other recovery mechanisms. Without these realignments, the evaluation report produces an earned return on equity of 9.88% and a resulting base rider formula rate plan revenue increase of $4.8 million. Excluding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act credits provided for by the tax reform adjustment mechanisms, total formula rate plan revenues were further increased by a total of $98 million as a result of the evaluation report due to adjustments to the additional capacity and MISO cost recovery mechanisms of the formula rate plan, and implementation of the transmission recovery mechanism. In August 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental formula rate plan evaluation report to reflect changes from the 2016 test year formula rate plan proceedings, a decrease to the transmission recovery mechanism to reflect lower actual capital additions, and a decrease to evaluation period expenses to reflect the terms of a new power sales agreement. Based on the August 2018 update, Entergy Louisiana recognized a total decrease in formula rate plan revenue of approximately $17.6 million. Results of the updated 2017 evaluation report filing were implemented with the September 2018 billing month subject to refund and review by the LPSC staff and intervenors. In accordance with the terms of the formula rate plan, in September 2018 the LPSC staff and intervenors submitted their responses to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s original formula rate plan evaluation report and supplemental compliance updates. The LPSC staff asserted objections/reservations regarding (1) Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s proposed rate adjustments associated with the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes related to reductions of rate base; (2) Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s reservation regarding treatment of a regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC; and (3) test year expenses billed from Entergy Services to Entergy \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nLouisiana. Intervenors also objected to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s treatment of the regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC. In August 2021 the LPSC staff issued a letter updating its objections/reservations for the 2017 test year formula rate plan evaluation report. In its letter, the LPSC staff reiterated its original objections/reservations pertaining to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s proposed rate adjustments associated with the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes related to reductions of rate base, specifically how the accumulated deferred income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions have been accounted for, and test year expenses billed from Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana. The LPSC staff further reserved its rights for future proceedings and to dispute future proposed adjustments to the 2017 test year formula rate plan evaluation report. The LPSC staff withdrew all other objections/reservations. A procedural schedule has not yet been established to resolve these issues. \n\nEntergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes. \n\n2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2018 calendar year operations. The 2018 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 10.61% leading to a base rider formula rate plan revenue decrease of $8.9 million. While base rider formula rate plan revenue decreased as a result of this filing, overall formula rate plan revenues increased by approximately $118.7 million. This outcome was primarily driven by a reduction to the credits previously flowed through the tax reform adjustment mechanism and an increase in the transmission recovery mechanism, partially offset by reductions in the additional capacity mechanism revenue requirements and extraordinary cost items. The filing is subject to review by the LPSC. Resulting rates were implemented in September 2019, subject to refund. \n\nEntergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes. \n\nSeveral parties intervened in the proceeding and the LPSC staff filed its report of objections/reservations in accordance with the applicable provisions of the formula rate plan. In its report the LPSC staff re-urged reservations with respect to the outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate plan filing and disputed the inclusion of certain affiliate costs for test years 2017 and 2018. The LPSC staff objected to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s proposal to combine residential rates but proposed the setting of a status conference to establish a procedural schedule to more fully address the issue. The LPSC staff also reserved its right to object to the treatment of the sale of the Willow Glen Power Station reflected in the evaluation report and to the August 2019 compliance update, which was made primarily to update the capital additions reflected in the formula rate plan&#8217;s transmission recovery mechanism, based on limited time to review it. Additionally, since the completion of certain transmission projects, the LPSC staff issued supplemental data requests addressing the prudence of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s expenditures in connection with those projects. Entergy Louisiana responded to all such requests. In August 2021 the LPSC staff issued a letter updating its objections/reservations for the 2018 test year formula rate plan evaluation report. In its letter, the LPSC staff reiterated its original objection/reservation pertaining to test year expenses billed from Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana and outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate plan evaluation report. The LPSC staff withdrew all other objections/reservations. \n\nCommercial operation at Lake Charles Power Station commenced in March 2020. In March 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2018 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of $108 million associated with the Lake Charles Power Station. The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2020. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nIn an effort to narrow the remaining issues in formula rate plan test years 2017 and 2018, Entergy Louisiana provided notice to the parties in October 2020 that it was withdrawing its request to combine residential rates. Entergy Louisiana noted that the withdrawal is without prejudice to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s right to seek to combine residential rates in a future proceeding. \n\n2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn May 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2019 calendar year operations. The 2019 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 9.66%. As such, no change to base rider formula rate plan revenue is required. Although base rider formula rate plan revenue did not change as a result of this filing, overall formula rate plan revenues increased by approximately $103 million. This outcome is driven by the removal of prior year credits associated with the sale of the Willow Glen Power Station and an increase in the transmission recovery mechanism. Also contributing to the overall change was an increase in legacy formula rate plan revenue requirements driven by legacy Entergy Louisiana capacity cost true-ups and higher annualized legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana revenues due to higher billing determinants, offset by reductions in MISO cost recovery mechanism and tax reform adjustment mechanism revenue requirements. In August 2020 the LPSC staff submitted a list of items for which it needs additional information to confirm the accuracy and compliance of the 2019 test year evaluation report. The LPSC staff objected to a proposed revenue neutral adjustment regarding a certain rider as being beyond the scope of permitted formula rate plan adjustments. Rates reflected in the May 2020 filing, with the exception of a revenue neutral rider adjustment, and as updated in an August 2020 filing, were implemented in September 2020, subject to refund. Entergy Louisiana is in the process of providing additional information and details on the May 2020 filing as requested by the LPSC staff. In August 2021 the LPSC staff issued a letter updating its objections/reservations for the 2019 test year formula rate plan filing. In its letter, the LPSC staff disputes Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s exclusion of approximately $251 thousand of interest income allocated from Entergy Operations and Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana to the extent that there are other adjustments that would move Entergy Louisiana out of the formula rate plan deadband. The LPSC staff reserved the right to further contest the issue in future proceedings. The LPSC staff further reserved outstanding issues from the 2017 and 2018 formula rate plan evaluation reports and withdrew all other remaining objections/reservations. \n\nIn November 2020, Entergy Louisiana accepted ownership of the Washington Parish Energy Center and filed an update to its 2019 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of $35 million associated with the Washington Parish Energy Center. The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of December 2020. In January 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2019 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the implementation of a scheduled step-up in its nuclear decommissioning revenue requirement and a true-up for under-collections of nuclear decommissioning expenses. The total rate adjustment increased formula rate plan revenues by approximately $1.2 million. The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of February 2021. \n\nRequest for Extension and Modification of Formula Rate Plan \n\nIn May 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its application for authority to extend its formula rate plan. In its application, Entergy Louisiana sought to maintain a 9.8% return on equity, with a bandwidth of 60 basis points above and below the midpoint, with a first-year midpoint reset. The parties reached a settlement in April 2021 regarding Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s proposed formula rate plan extension. In May 2021 the LPSC approved the uncontested settlement. Key terms of the settlement include: a three year term (test years 2020, 2021, and 2022) covering a rate-effective period of September 2021 through August 2024; a 9.50% return on equity, with a smaller, 50 basis point deadband above and below (9.0%-10.0%); elimination of sharing if earnings are outside the deadband; a $63 million rate increase for test year 2020 (exclusive of riders); continuation of existing riders (transmission, additional capacity, etc.); addition of a distribution recovery mechanism permitting $225 million per year of distribution investment above a baseline level to be recovered dollar for dollar; modification of the tax mechanism to allow timely rate changes in the event the federal corporate income tax rate is changed from 21%; a \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ncumulative rate increase limit of $70 million (exclusive of riders) for test years 2021 and 2022; and deferral of up to $7 million per year in 2021 and 2022 of expenditures on vegetation management for outside of right of way hazard trees. \n\n2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn June 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2020 calendar year operations. The 2020 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 8.45%, with a base formula rate plan revenue increase of $63 million. Certain reductions in formula rate plan revenue driven by lower sales volumes, reductions in capacity cost and net MISO cost, and higher credits resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offset the base formula rate plan revenue increase, leading to a net increase in formula rate plan revenue of $50.7 million. The report also included multiple new adjustments to account for, among other things, the calculation of distribution recovery mechanism revenues. The effects of the changes to total formula rate plan revenue were different for each legacy company, primarily due to differences in the legacy companies&#8217; capacity cost changes, including the effect of true-ups. Legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $27 million and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $23.7 million. Subject to refund and LPSC review, the resulting changes became effective for bills rendered during the first billing cycle of September 2021. Discovery commenced in the proceeding. In August 2021, Entergy Louisiana submitted an update to its evaluation report to account for various changes. Relative to the June 2021 filing, the total formula rate plan revenue increased by $14.2 million to an updated total of $64.9 million. Legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $32.8 million and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $32.1 million. The results of the 2020 test year evaluation report bandwidth calculation were unchanged as there was no change in the earned return on common equity of 8.45%. In September 2021 the LPSC staff filed a letter with a general statement of objections/reservations because it had not completed its review and indicated it would update the letter once its review was complete. Should the parties be unable to resolve any objections, those issues will be set for hearing, with recovery of the associated costs subject to refund. \n\n2021 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn May 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2021 calendar year operations. The 2021 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 8.33%, with a base formula rate plan revenue increase of $65.3 million. Other increases in formula rate plan revenue driven by reductions in Tax Cut and Jobs Act credits and additions to transmission and distribution plant in service reflected through the transmission recovery mechanism and distribution recovery mechanism are partly offset by an increase in net MISO revenues, leading to a net increase in formula rate plan revenue of $152.9 million. The effects of the changes to total formula rate plan revenue are different for each legacy company, primarily due to differences in the legacy companies&#8217; capacity cost changes, including the effect of true-ups. Legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $86 million and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $66.9 million. In August 2022 the LPSC staff filed a list of objections/reservations, including outstanding issues from the test years 2017-2020 formula rate plan filings, utilizing the extraordinary cost mechanism to address one-time changes such as state tax rate changes, and failing to include an adjustment for revenues not received as a result of Hurricane Ida. Subject to refund and LPSC review, the resulting changes to formula rate plan revenues became effective for bills rendered during the first billing cycle of September 2022. \n\nInvestigation of Costs Billed by Entergy Services \n\nIn November 2018 the LPSC issued a notice of proceeding initiating an investigation into costs incurred by Entergy Services that are included in the retail rates of Entergy Louisiana. As stated in the notice of proceeding, the LPSC observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by Entergy Services. Discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the audit. There has been no further activity in the investigation since May 2019. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nFuel and purchased power cost recovery \n\nEntergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to the billing month. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. \n\nIn February 2021, Entergy Louisiana incurred extraordinary fuel costs associated with the February 2021 winter storms. To mitigate the effect of these costs on customer bills, in March 2021, Entergy Louisiana requested and the LPSC approved the deferral and recovery of $166 million in incremental fuel costs over five months beginning in April 2021. The incremental fuel costs remain subject to review for reasonableness and eligibility for recovery through the fuel adjustment clause mechanism. The final amount of incremental fuel costs is subject to change through the resettlement process. At its April 2021 meeting, the LPSC authorized its staff to review the prudence of the February 2021 fuel costs incurred by all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities, including both gas and electric utilities. At its June 2021 meeting, the LPSC approved the hiring of consultants to assist its staff in this review. In May 2022 the LPSC staff issued an audit report regarding Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause charges (for its electric operations) recommending no financial disallowances, but including several prospective recommendations. Responsive testimony was filed by one intervenor and the parties agreed to suspend any procedural schedule and move toward settlement discussions to close the matter. Also in May 2022 the LPSC staff issued an audit report regarding Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s purchased gas adjustment charges (for its gas operations) that did not propose any financial disallowances. The LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana submitted a joint report on the audit report and draft order to the LPSC concluding that Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s gas distribution operations and fuel costs were not significantly adversely affected by the February 2021 winter storms and the resulting increase in natural gas prices. The LPSC issued an order approving the joint report in October 2022. \n\nIn March 2021 the LPSC staff provided notice of an audit of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s purchased gas adjustment clause filings covering the period January 2018 through December 2020. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s purchased gas adjustment clause for that period. Discovery is ongoing, and no audit report has been filed. \n\nTo mitigate high electric bills, primarily driven by high summer usage and elevated gas prices, Entergy Louisiana has deferred approximately $225 million of fuel expense incurred in April, May, June, July, August, and September 2022 (as reflected on June, July, August, September, October, and November 2022 bills). These deferrals were included in the over/under calculation of the fuel adjustment clause, which is intended to recover the full amount of the costs included on a rolling twelve-month basis. \n\nCOVID-19 Orders \n\nIn April 2020 the LPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to record as a regulatory asset expenses incurred from the suspension of disconnections and collection of late fees imposed by LPSC orders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, utilities may seek future recovery, subject to LPSC review and approval, of losses and expenses incurred due to compliance with the LPSC&#8217;s COVID-19 orders. The suspension of late fees and disconnects for non-pay was extended until the first billing cycle after July 16, 2020. In January 2021, Entergy Louisiana resumed disconnections for customers in all customer classes with past-due balances that had not made payment arrangements. Utilities seeking to recover the regulatory asset must formally petition the LPSC to do so, identifying the direct and indirect costs for which recovery is sought. Any such request is subject to LPSC review and approval. As of December 31, 2022, Entergy Louisiana had a regulatory asset of $47.8 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nNet Metering Rulemaking \n\nIn September 2019 the LPSC issued an order modifying its rules regarding net metering installations. Among other things, the rule provides for 2-channel billing for net metering with excess energy put to the grid being compensated at the utility&#8217;s avoided cost. However, the rule does provide that net meter installations in place as of December 31, 2019 will be subject to 1:1 net metering with excess energy put to the grid being compensated at the full retail rate for a period of 15 years (through December 31, 2034), after which those installations will be subject to 2-channel billing. The rule also eliminates the existing limit on the cumulative number of net meter installations. \n\nIndustrial and Commercial Customers \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s industrial customer base. Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. \n\nFederal Regulation \n\nSee the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#8211; Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation. \n\nNuclear Matters \n\nEntergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend and Waterford 3 nuclear power plants. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues related to equipment reliability, to position Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend or Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. Waterford 3&#8217;s operating license expires in 2044 and River Bend&#8217;s operating license expires in 2045. \n\nNRC Reactor Oversight Process \n\nThe NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response. The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC&#8217;s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee. The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: &#8220;licensee response column,&#8221; or Column 1, &#8220;regulatory response column,&#8221; or Column 2, &#8220;degraded cornerstone column,&#8221; or Column 3, &#8220;multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,&#8221; or Column 4, and &#8220;unacceptable performance,&#8221; or Column 5. Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities. Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nto progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs. Continued plant operation is not permitted for plants in Column 5. River Bend is currently in Column 1, and Waterford 3 is currently in Column 2. \n\nIn September 2022 the NRC placed Waterford 3 in Column 2 based on an error associated with a radiation monitor calibration. Entergy corrected the issue with the radiation monitor in February 2022; however, Waterford 3 is expected to remain in Column 2 until third quarter 2023 based on a subsequent radiation monitor calibration issue. \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. \n\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs \n\nSee &#8220; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. \n\nUtility Regulatory Accounting \n\nSee &#8220; Utility Regulatory Accounting &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nSee &#8220; Impairment of Long-lived Assets &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nSee &#8220; Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEntergy Louisiana&#8217;s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See &#8220; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy&#8217;s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. \n\nCost Sensitivity \n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on 2022 Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $1,554 $29,524 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $2,785 $&#8212; Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $1,276 $6,545 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on 2022 Accumulated postretirement Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $273 $4,653 Health care cost trend 0.25% $750 $3,868 ##TABLE_END\n\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. \n\nCosts and Employer Contributions \n\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2022 was $100.6 million, including $58.6 million in settlement costs. Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2023 qualified pension cost to be $29.2 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $53.7 million to its qualified pension plans in 2022 and estimates pension contributions will be approximately $44.6 million in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. \n\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2022 were $6 million. Entergy Louisiana expects 2023 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs of approximately $1.4 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $16.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2022 and estimates that 2023 contributions will be approximately $15.4 million. \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nSee &#8220; Other Contingencies &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee &#8220; New Accounting Pronouncements &#8221; section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the member and Board of Directors of \n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity (pages 370 through 376 and applicable items in pages 53 through 245), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nRate and Regulatory Matters &#8212;Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Louisiana Public Service Commission (the &#8220;LPSC&#8221;), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Louisiana, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the LPSC and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the LPSC and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs, and refunds to customers. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the LPSC and the FERC involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the LPSC and the FERC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the LPSC and the FERC for the Company, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the LPSC&#8217;s and the FERC&#8217;s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company&#8217;s filings with the LPSC and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan filing, and considered the filings with the LPSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company&#8217;s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management&#8217;s assertions . \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order, to assess management&#8217;s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\nSecuritization Financing - Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators &#8212;Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nHurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta in 2020 and Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida in 2021 caused significant damage to portions of the Company&#8217;s service area within the state of Louisiana. In March 2022, the LPSC issued a Financing Order authorizing financing of $3.186 billion of system restoration costs utilizing the securitization process authorized by Louisiana Act 55 financing, as supplemented by Act 293 of the Louisiana Legislature&#8217;s Regular Session of 2021 (&#8220;Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293&#8221;). In May 2022, the securitization financing closed, resulting in the issuance of $3.194 billion principal amount bonds by Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (&#8220;LCDA&#8221;), a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana. The LCDA loaned the proceeds to the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (&#8220;LURC&#8221;), and the \n\nLURC contributed the net bond proceeds to a State legislatively authorized and LURC-sponsored trust, Restoration Law Trust I (the &#8220;storm trust&#8221;). The Company and the LURC each hold beneficial interests in the storm trust. \n\nThe Company does not report the bonds issued by the LCDA on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA. The bonds are secured by system restoration property, which is the right granted by law to the LURC to collect a system restoration charge from customers. The Company collects the system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. The Company does not report the collection of system restoration charges as revenue because the Company is merely acting as a billing and collection agent for the LCDA and the LURC. In the remote possibility that the system restoration charge, as well as any funds in the excess subaccount and funds in the debt service reserve account, are insufficient to service the bonds resulting in a payment default, the storm trust is required to liquidate Entergy Finance Company preferred membership interests in an amount equal to what would be required to cure the default. The estimated value of this indirect guarantee is immaterial. The Company consolidates the storm trust as a variable interest entity and the LURC&#8217;s 1% beneficial interest is shown as a noncontrolling interest in the financial statements. \n\nWe identified management&#8217;s conclusion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its conclusion. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments involved especially subjective judgment and specialized knowledge of accounting for securitization financing transactions. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293, securitization financing included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the accounting impact of this securitization financing transaction, including the conclusion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of the Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293, securitization financing, including the balances recorded. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory and financing orders issued by the LPSC for the Company, the LURC, and the LCDA, and evaluated the external information to compare to management&#8217;s conclusions. \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management and support from the Company&#8217;s internal and external legal counsel regarding the legal status of the bonds issued by the LCDA and the system restoration property granted to the LURC to assess management&#8217;s assertion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise and experience in addressing the accounting for securitization financing transactions by regulated utilities, we evaluated the Company&#8217;s conclusion, including the conclusion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions &#8212;Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions under a two-step approach with a more likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company has uncertain tax positions which require management to make significant judgments and assumptions to determine whether available information supports the assertion that the recognition threshold is met, particularly related to the technical merits and facts and circumstances of each position, as well as the probability of different potential outcomes. These uncertain tax positions could be significantly affected by events such as additional transactions contemplated or consummated by the Company as well as audits by taxing authorities of the tax positions. The net unrecognized tax benefit associated with the uncertain tax positions related to the Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293, securitization financing is $586 million at December 31, 2022. The securitization provides for a tax accounting permanent difference resulting in a net reduction of income tax expense in second quarter 2022 of approximately $290 million, after taking into account a provision for uncertain tax positions. \n\nGiven the significant judgments made by management, we identified management&#8217;s conclusion that these uncertain tax positions met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold as a critical audit matter. Auditing management&#8217;s \n\njudgments regarding these uncertain tax positions involved specialized knowledge of uncertain tax positions and significant auditor judgment to evaluate the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertain tax positions included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls related to uncertain tax positions, including those over the recognition and measurement of the income tax benefits. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures, and the balances recorded, related to uncertain tax positions. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the uncertain tax positions by testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the uncertain tax position. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we tested the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions and management&#8217;s key estimates and judgments made by: \n\n&#8226; Assessing the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions by comparing to similar cases filed with the Internal Revenue Service. \n\n&#8226; Obtaining an opinion from the Company&#8217;s external legal counsel regarding certain federal income tax consequences related to the Act 55, as supplemented by Act 293 securitization financing and evaluating whether the analysis was consistent with our interpretation of the relevant laws and circumstances. \n\n&#8226; Considering the impact of changes or settlements in the tax environment on management&#8217;s methods and assumptions used to estimate the uncertain tax positions. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2001. \n\n##TABLE_START ENTERGY LOUISIANA, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS &#160;

##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. &#8220;Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income&#8221; includes the revenue variance associated with these items. \n\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan rates effective April 2021, July 2021, April 2022, and August 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filings. \n\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales and an increase in commercial usage. The increase in commercial usage was primarily due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in 2021. \n\nThe retail one-time bill credit represents the disbursement of settlement proceeds in the form of a one-time bill credit provided to retail customers during the September 2022 billing cycle as a result of the System Energy settlement agreement with the MPSC. There is no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues was offset by a credit to fuel and purchased power expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the settlement agreement and the MPSC directive related to the disbursement of settlement proceeds. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Mississippi for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 % Change (GWh) Residential 5,679 5,494 3 Commercial 4,586 4,455 3 Industrial 2,359 2,287 3 Governmental 414 409 1 Total retail 13,038 12,645 3 Sales for resale: Non-associated companies 2,914 4,364 (33) Total 15,952 17,009 (6) ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s operating revenues. \n\nOther Income Statement Variances \n\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $4.7 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance costs, higher safety and training costs, and higher reliability costs, partially offset by a decrease in meter reading expenses as a result of the deployment of advanced metering systems; \n\n&#8226; $3.3 million in amortization of the bad debt expense deferral resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of regulatory activity associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $2.7 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to higher energy efficiency costs; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $2.3 million in customer service center support costs primarily due to higher contract costs; and \n\n&#8226; several individually insignificant items. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million as a result of the amount of transmission costs allocated by MISO. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments and millage rate increases. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. \n\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes: \n\n&#8226; regulatory credits of $22.6 million, recorded in third quarter 2022, to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation reached in the 2022 formula rate plan filing proceeding and regulatory credits of $18.2 million, recorded in the fourth quarter 2022, to reflect that the 2022 estimated earned return was below the formula bandwidth. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan filings; and \n\n&#8226; regulatory credits of $19.9 million, recorded in the second quarter 2021, to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation reached in the 2021 formula rate plan filing proceeding and regulatory credits of $19 million, recorded in the fourth quarter 2021, to reflect that the 2021 earned return was below the formula bandwidth. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan filings. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nInterest expense increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $200 million of 2.55% Series mortgage bonds in November 2021; \n\n&#8226; the $150 million unsecured term loan drawn in June 2022; \n\n&#8226; borrowings of $100 million in 2022 on Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s credit facility, which were repaid in 2022; and \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $200 million of 3.50% Series mortgage bonds in March 2021. \n\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reflects the earnings or losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest partner of the tax equity partnership for the Sunflower Solar facility under HLBV accounting. Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory charges of $21.4 million in 2022 to defer the difference between the losses allocated to the tax equity partner under the HLBV method of accounting and the earnings/loss that would have been allocated to the tax equity partner under its respective ownership percentage in the partnership. See Note 1 to the financial statements for discussion of the HLBV method of accounting. \n\nThe effective income tax rates were 23.7% for 2022 and 21.4% for 2021. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nIncome Tax Legislation \n\nSee the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow \n\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $47,627 $18 $51,601 Net cash provided by (used in): &#160; Operating activities 405,649 350,960 300,314 Investing activities (620,740) (686,654) (530,762) Financing activities 184,443 383,303 178,865 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (30,648) 47,609 (51,583) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $16,979 $47,627 $18 ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $54.7 million in 2 022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; the receipt of $235 million in settlement proceeds, of which $198.3 million was applied to the under-recovered deferred fuel balance. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery and the System Energy settlement agreement with the MPSC; \n\n&#8226; higher collections from customers; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $23.6 million in storm spending in 2022, primarily due to Winter Storm Uri restoration efforts in 2021. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; increased fuel costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery; \n\n&#8226; payments to vendors, including timing and an increase in cost of operations; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $19.6 million in pension contributions in 2022. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $14.3 million in income tax refunds in 2022. Entergy Mississippi received income tax refunds in 2022 and 2021, each in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased $65.9 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $94.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022 and lower spending in 2022 on advanced metering infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; money pool activity; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $26.9 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a lower scope of work performed in 2022 as compared to 2021. \n\nThe decrease was partially offset by the initial payment of approximately $105.1 million in May 2022 for the purchase of the Sunflower Solar facility by a consolidated tax equity partnership. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Sunflower Solar facility purchase. \n\nDecreases in Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s receivable from the money pool decreased $13.6 million in 2022 compared to increasing by $40.5 million in 2021. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries&#8217; need for external short-term borrowings. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased $198.9 million in 2022 primarily due to the issuance of $200 million of 3.50% Series mortgage bonds in March 2021 and the issuance of $200 million of 2.55% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2021. \n\nThe decrease was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; proceeds received in June 2022 from a $150 million unsecured term loan due December 2023; \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n&#8226; a capital contribution of $9.6 million received in May 2022 from the noncontrolling tax equity investor in MS Sunflower Partnership, LLC and used by the partnership for initial payment in the acquisition of the Sunflower Solar facility. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Sunflower Solar facility purchase; \n\n&#8226; a capital contribution of $15.1 million received in December 2022 from the noncontrolling tax equity investor in MS Sunflower Partnership, LLC which will be used by the partnership for final payment in the acquisition of the Sunflower Solar facility in 2023. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Sunflower Solar facility purchase; and \n\n&#8226; money pool activity. \n\nDecreases in Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s payable to the money pool decreased $16.5 million in 2021. \n\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt to capital 53.4 % 54.3 % Effect of subtracting cash (0.2 %) (0.5 %) Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 53.2 % 53.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nEntergy Mississippi seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Mississippi may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy Mississippi may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nUses of Capital \n\nEntergy Mississippi requires capital resources for: \n\n&#8226; construction and other capital investments; \n\n&#8226; debt maturities or retirements; \n\n&#8226; working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and \n\n&#8226; distributions and interest payments. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s planned construction and other capital investments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 &#160; (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment: &#160; &#160; Generation $85 $75 $370 Transmission 60 80 90 Distribution 255 280 215 Utility Support 65 30 40 Total $465 $465 $715 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s portfolio; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to drive reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026-2027 After 2027 &#160; (In Millions) Long-term debt (a) $480 $167 $66 $281 $2,912 Operating leases (b) $7 $6 $5 $5 $2 Finance leases (b) $2 $2 $2 $2 $1 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. \n\n(b) Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nEntergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $21.1 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $136 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nEntergy Mississippi has $42.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nIn addition, Entergy Mississippi enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations. Entergy Mississippi has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Mississippi pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. \n\nSunflower Solar \n\nIn November 2018, Entergy Mississippi announced that it signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW solar photovoltaic facility to be sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Sunflower County, Mississippi. The estimated base purchase price is approximately $138.4 million. The estimated total investment, including the base purchase price and other related costs, for Entergy Mississippi to acquire the Sunflower Solar facility is approximately $153.2 million. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. The project was being built by Sunflower County Solar Project, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Recurrent Energy, LLC. In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed a joint petition with Sunflower County Solar Project with the MPSC for Sunflower County Solar Project to construct and for Entergy Mississippi to acquire and thereafter own, operate, improve, and maintain the solar facility. Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, in the formula rate plan to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the annual ownership costs of the Sunflower Solar facility. In December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism. Recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment requires MPSC approval for each new resource. In March 2020, Entergy Mississippi filed supplemental testimony addressing questions and observations raised in August 2019 by consultants retained by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and proposing an alternative structure for the transaction that would reduce its cost. In April 2020 the MPSC issued an order approving certification of the Sunflower Solar facility and its recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, subject to certain conditions, including: (i) that Entergy Mississippi pursue a tax equity partnership structure through which the partnership would acquire and own the facility under the build-own-transfer agreement and (ii) that if Entergy Mississippi does not consummate the partnership structure under the terms of the order, there will be a cap of $136 million on the level of recoverable costs. In April 2022, Entergy Mississippi confirmed mechanical completion of the Sunflower Solar facility. Pursuant to the MPSC&#8217;s April 2020 order, MS Sunflower Partnership, LLC was formed for the tax equity partnership with Entergy Mississippi as its managing member. In May 2022 both Entergy Mississippi and the tax equity investor made capital contributions to the tax equity partnership that were then used to make an initial payment of $105 million for acquisition of the facility. In July 2022, pursuant to the MPSC&#8217;s April 2020 order, Entergy Mississippi submitted a compliance filing to the MPSC with updated calculations of the impact of the Sunflower Solar facility on rate base and revenue requirement for the Sunflower Solar facility and benefits of the tax equity partnership. In November 2022 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s July 2022 compliance filing and authorized the recovery of the costs of the Sunflower Solar facility through the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism in the formula rate plan with rates effective in December 2022. Substantial completion of the Sunflower Solar facility was accepted by Entergy Mississippi in September 2022. Also, commercial operation at the Sunflower Solar facility commenced in September 2022. Pending the remediation of certain operational issues, final payment is expected in first quarter 2023. See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s purchase of the Sunflower Solar facility. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nSources of Capital \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s sources to meet its capital requirements include: \n\n&#8226; internally generated funds; \n\n&#8226; cash on hand; \n\n&#8226; the Entergy System money pool; \n\n&#8226; storm reserve escrow accounts; \n\n&#8226; debt or preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; capital contributions; and \n\n&#8226; bank financing under new or existing facilities. \n\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit. \n\nAll debt and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements. Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 (In Thousands) $26,879 $40,456 ($16,516) $44,693 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. \n\nEntergy Mississippi has three separate credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $95 million scheduled to expire in April 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there were no cash borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. Also, Entergy Mississippi has a credit facility in the amount of $150 million scheduled to expire in July 2024. As of December 31, 2022, there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, Entergy Mississippi is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility primarily as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO. As of December 31, 2022, $6.7 million in MISO letters of credit and $1 million in non-MISO letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s uncommitted letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities. \n\nEntergy Mississippi obtained authorization from the FERC through October 2023 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and security issuances. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s short-term borrowing limits. \n\nEntergy Mississippi had $33.5 million in its storm reserve escrow account at December 31, 2022. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery \n\nThe rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Mississippi is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. \n\nFilings with the MPSC \n\nRetail Rates \n\n2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn March 2020, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2020 test year filing and 2019 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return for the historical 2019 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2020 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2020 test year filing shows a $24.6 million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.51% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2019 look-back filing compares actual 2019 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflects the need for a $7.3 million interim increase in formula rate plan revenues. In accordance with the MPSC-approved revisions to the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $24.3 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2019 retail revenues, effective with the April 2020 billing cycle, subject to refund. In June 2020, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed that the 2020 test year filing showed that a $23.8 million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.51% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. Pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s 2019 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.75% in calendar year 2019, which is within the look-back bandwidth. As a result, there is no change in formula rate plan revenues in the 2019 look-back filing. In June 2020 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective for the first billing cycle of July 2020. In the June 2020 order the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to submit revisions to its formula rate plan to realign recovery of costs from its energy efficiency cost recovery rider to its formula rate plan. In November 2020 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s revisions to its formula rate plan providing for the realignment of energy efficiency costs to its formula rate plan, the deferral of energy efficiency expenditures into a regulatory asset, and the elimination of its energy efficiency cost recovery rider effective with the January 2022 billing cycle. \n\n2021 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn March 2021, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2021 test year filing and 2020 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return for the historical 2020 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2021 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2021 test year filing shows a $95.4 million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.69% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The change in formula rate plan revenues, however, is capped at 4% of retail revenues, which equates to a revenue change of $44.3 million. The 2021 evaluation report also includes $3.9 million in demand side management costs for which the MPSC approved realignment of recovery from the energy efficiency rider to the formula rate plan. These costs are not subject to the 4% cap and result in a total change in formula rate plan revenues of $48.2 million. The 2020 look-back filing compares actual 2020 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflects the need for a $16.8 million interim increase in formula rate plan revenues. In addition, the 2020 look-back filing includes an interim capacity adjustment true-up for the Choctaw Generating Station, which increases the look-back interim rate adjustment by $1.7 million. These interim rate adjustments total $18.5 million. In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $22.1 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2020 retail revenues, effective \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nwith the April 2021 billing cycle, subject to refund, pending a final MPSC order. The $3.9 million of demand side management costs and the Choctaw Generating Station true-up of $1.7 million, which are not subject to the 2% cap of 2020 retail revenues, were included in the April 2021 rate adjustments. \n\nIn June 2021, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed the 2021 test year filing that resulted in a total rate increase of $48.2 million. Pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s 2020 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.12% in calendar year 2020, which is below the look-back bandwidth, resulting in a $17.5 million increase in formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through June 2022. This includes $1.7 million related to the Choctaw Generating Station and $3.7 million of COVID-19 non-bad debt expenses. See &#8220; COVID-19 Orders &#8221; below for additional discussion of provisions of the joint stipulation related to COVID-19 expenses. In June 2021 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective for the first billing cycle of July 2021. In June 2021, Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory credits of $19.9 million to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation. \n\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn March 2022, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2022 test year filing and 2021 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return for the historical 2021 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2022 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. The 2022 test year filing shows a $69 million rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.70% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth. The change in formula rate plan revenues, however, is capped at 4% of retail revenues, which equates to a revenue change of $48.6 million. The 2021 look-back filing compares actual 2021 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflects the need for a $34.5 million interim increase in formula rate plan revenues. In fourth quarter 2021, Entergy Mississippi recorded a regulatory asset of $19 million to reflect the then-current estimate in connection with the look-back feature of the formula rate plan. In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $24.3 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2021 retail revenues, effective in April 2022. \n\nIn June 2022, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed the 2022 test year filing that resulted in a total rate increase of $48.6 million. Pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s 2021 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 5.99% in calendar year 2021, which is below the look-back bandwidth, resulting in a $34.3 million increase in the formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through June 2023. In July 2022 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective in August 2022. In July 2022, Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory credits of $22.6 million to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation. In August 2022 an intervenor filed a statutorily-authorized direct appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court seeking review of the MPSC&#8217;s July 2022 order approving the joint stipulation confirming Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s 2022 formula rate plan filing. The rates that went into effect in August 2022 are not stayed or otherwise impacted while the appeal is pending. \n\nIn July 2022 the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to flow $14.1 million of the power management rider over-recovery balance to customers beginning in August 2022 through December 2022 to mitigate the bill impact of the increase in formula rate plan revenues. \n\n2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nEntergy Mississippi plans to file its look-back evaluation report in March 2023 that will compare actual 2022 results to the performance-adjusted allowed return on rate base. In fourth quarter 2022, Entergy Mississippi recorded a regulatory asset of $18.2 million in connection with the look-back feature of the formula rate plan to reflect that the 2022 estimated earned return was below the formula bandwidth. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nNet Metering Rulemaking \n\nPursuant to a mandatory reopener provision in its net metering rule, the MPSC opened a docket to review the efficacy and fairness of its existing net metering rule. In July 2022 the MPSC issued an order adopting revisions to its net metering rule. Among other things, the amended rule requires utilities to calculate avoided cost using daytime energy production, grandfathers a 2.5 cents per kWh distributed generation benefits adder for 25 years, and expands eligibility for the 2 cents per kWh low-income benefits adder to households up to 250% of the federal poverty level and grandfathers that adder for 25 years. The amended rule expands meter aggregation to include systems up to 3 MW alternating current and to any additional meters within the same electric utility service territory. The amended rule also increases the 3% net metering participation cap to 4% and requires that utilities seek MPSC approval prior to refusing additional net generation requests. The MPSC also directs utilities to make rate filings implementing rebates for distributed generation facilities. Because of the size and number of customers eligible under this new rule, there is a risk of loss of load and the shifting of costs to customers. In August 2022, Entergy Mississippi filed a motion for rehearing on the proposed net metering rule, which the MPSC granted. A hearing on the proposed rule was held in September 2022. In October 2022 the MPSC adopted an amended rule, which will now be known as the Distributed Generation Rule. In the Distributed Generation Rule, all provisions permitting meter aggregation were struck. The Distributed Generation Rule maintains the 3% net metering participation cap. The Distributed Generation Rule grandfathers a 2.5 cents per kWh distributed generation benefits adder for 25 years and expands eligibility for the 2 cents per kWh low-income benefits adder to households up to 225% of the federal poverty level and grandfathers that adder for 25 years. The Distributed Generation Rule also directs utilities to make rate filings implementing up-front incentives for distributed generating systems and demand response battery systems, and to establish a public K-12 solar for schools program. \n\nCOVID-19 Orders \n\nIn March 2020 the MPSC issued an order suspending disconnections for a period of sixty days. The MPSC extended the order on disconnections through May 26, 2020. In April 2020 the MPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to defer incremental costs and expenses associated with COVID-19 compliance and to seek future recovery through rates of the prudently incurred incremental costs and expenses. In December 2020, Entergy Mississippi resumed disconnections for commercial, industrial, and governmental customers with past-due balances that have not made payment arrangements. In January 2021, Entergy Mississippi resumed disconnecting service for residential customers with past-due balances that had not made payment arrangements. Pursuant to the June 2021 MPSC order approving Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s 2021 formula rate plan filing, Entergy Mississippi stopped deferring COVID-19 non-bad debt expenses effective December 31, 2020 and included those expenses in the look-back filing for the 2021 formula rate plan test year. In the order, the MPSC also adopted Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s quantification and methodology for calculating COVID-19 incremental bad debt expenses and authorized Entergy Mississippi to continue deferring these bad debt expenses through December 2021. Entergy Mississippi began recovery of the bad debt expense deferral resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic over a three-year period with implementation of the interim formula rate plan rates in April 2022. As of December 31, 2022, Entergy Mississippi had a remaining regulatory asset of $9.8 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nFuel and purchased power cost recovery \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. \n\nIn November 2019, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation included $39.6 million of prior over-recovery flowing back to customers beginning February 2020. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s balance in its deferred fuel account did not decrease as expected after implementation of the new factor. In an effort to assist customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020, Entergy Mississippi requested an interim adjustment to the energy cost recovery rider to credit \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\napproximately $50 million from the over-recovered balance in the deferred fuel account to customers over four consecutive billing months. The MPSC approved this interim adjustment in May 2020 effective for June through September 2020 bills. \n\nIn November 2020, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation of the annual factor included an over-recovery of approximately $24.4 million as of September 30, 2020. In January 2021 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2021 bills. \n\nIn November 2021, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately $80.6 million as of September 30, 2021. In December 2021, at the request of the MPSC, Entergy Mississippi submitted a proposal to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs on customer bills during 2022. Entergy Mississippi proposed that the deferred fuel balance as of December 31, 2021, which was $121.9 million, be amortized over three years, and that the MPSC authorize Entergy Mississippi to apply its weighted-average cost of capital as the carrying cost for the unamortized fuel balance. In January 2022 the MPSC approved the amortization of $100 million of the deferred fuel balance over two years and authorized Entergy Mississippi to apply its weighted-average cost of capital as the carrying cost for the unamortized fuel balance. The MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2022 bills. \n\nSee &#8220; Complaints Against System Energy - System Energy Settlement with the MPSC &#8221; in Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the settlement agreement filed with the FERC in June 2022. The settlement, which was contingent upon FERC approval, provides for a refund of $235 million from System Energy to Entergy Mississippi. In July 2022 the MPSC directed the disbursement of settlement proceeds, ordering Entergy Mississippi to provide a one-time $80 bill credit to each of its approximately 460,000 retail customers to be effective during the September 2022 billing cycle, and to apply the remaining proceeds to Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s under-recovered deferred fuel balance. In accordance with the MPSC&#8217;s directive, Entergy Mississippi provided approximately $36.7 million in customer bill credits as a result of the settlement. In November 2022, Entergy Mississippi applied the remaining settlement proceeds in the amount of approximately $198.3 million to Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s under-recovered deferred fuel balance. In November 2022 the FERC issued an order approving the System Energy settlement with the MPSC. \n\nEntergy Mississippi had a deferred fuel balance of approximately $291.7 million under the energy cost recovery rider as of July 31, 2022, along with an over-recovery balance of $51.1 million under the power management rider. Without further action, Entergy Mississippi anticipated a year-end deferred fuel balance of approximately $200 million after application of a portion of the System Energy settlement proceeds, as discussed above. In September 2022, Entergy Mississippi filed for interim adjustments under both the energy cost recovery rider and the power management rider. Entergy Mississippi proposed five monthly incremental adjustments to the net energy cost factor designed to collect the under-recovered fuel balance as of July 31, 2022 and to reflect the recovery of a higher natural gas price. Entergy Mississippi also proposed five monthly incremental adjustments to the power management adjustment factor designed to flow through to customers the over-recovered power management rider balance as of July 31, 2022. In October 2022 the MPSC approved modified interim adjustments to Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s energy cost recovery rider and power management rider. The MPSC approved dividing the energy cost recovery rider interim adjustment into two components that would allow Entergy Mississippi to 1) recover a natural gas fuel rate that is better aligned with current prices and 2) recover the estimated under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of September 30, 2022 over a period of 20 months. The MPSC approved six monthly incremental adjustments to the net energy cost factor designed to reflect the recovery of a higher natural gas price. The MPSC also approved six monthly incremental adjustments to the power management adjustment factor designed to flow through to customers the over-recovered power management rider balance. In accordance with the order of the MPSC, Entergy Mississippi did not file an annual redetermination of the energy cost recovery rider or the power management rider in November 2022. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s November 2023 annual redetermination will not reflect any part of the estimated under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of September 30, 2022; it will \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nonly reflect any over/under recovery that accumulates after September 2022. The November 2024 annual redetermination will include the total deferred fuel balance, including any over- or under-recovery of the deferred fuel balance as of September 30, 2022. \n\nStorm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators \n\nEntergy Mississippi has approval from the MPSC to collect a storm damage provision of $1.75 million per month. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeds $15 million, the collection of the storm damage provision ceases until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision becomes less than $10 million. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s storm damage provision balance has been less than $10 million since May 2019, and Entergy Mississippi has been billing the monthly storm damage provision since July 2019. \n\nFederal Regulation \n\nSee the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#8211; Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation. \n\nNuclear Matters \n\nSee the &#8220; Nuclear Matters &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters. \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Mississippi is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. \n\nUtility Regulatory Accounting \n\nSee &#8220; Utility Regulatory Accounting &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nSee &#8220; Impairment of Long-lived Assets &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nSee &#8220; Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. \n\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEntergy Mississippi&#8217;s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See &#8220; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy&#8217;s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. \n\nCost Sensitivity \n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on 2022 Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $364 $7,086 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $719 $&#8212; Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $303 $1,533 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on 2022 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $27 $1,138 Health care cost trend 0.25% $84 $982 ##TABLE_END\n\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. \n\nCosts and Employer Contributions \n\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2022 was $29.2 million, including $15.8 million in settlement costs. Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2023 qualified pension cost to be $9 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $33.3 million to its qualified pension plans in 2022 and estimates 2023 pension contributions will be \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\napproximately $21.1 million, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. \n\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Mississippi in 2022 was $4.4 million. Entergy Mississippi expects 2023 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $2.5 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $759 thousand to its other postretirement plan in 2022 and estimates 2023 contributions will be approximately $136 thousand. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nSee &#8220; Other Contingencies &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee &#8220; New Accounting Pronouncements &#8221; section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the member and Board of Directors of \n\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in equity (pages 394 through 398 and applicable items in pages 53 through 245), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRate and Regulatory Matters &#8212;Entergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (the &#8220;MPSC&#8221;), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Mississippi, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the MPSC and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the MPSC and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the MPSC and the FERC, involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the MPSC and the FERC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the MPSC and the FERC for the Company, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the MPSC&#8217;s and FERC&#8217;s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company&#8217;s filings with the MPSC and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan filing, and considered the filings with the MPSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company&#8217;s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management&#8217;s assertions. \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management&#8217;s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2001. \n\n##TABLE_START ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS &#160;

S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \n\nResults of Operations \n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nNet Income \n\nNet income increased $32.3 million primarily due to higher retail electric price and higher volume/weather, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, a higher effective income tax rate, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher interest expense. \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nFollowing is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2022 to 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Amount &#160; (In Millions) 2021 operating revenues $768.9 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income 147.7 Retail electric price 42.2 Volume/weather 25.8 Retail gas price 12.7 2022 operating revenues $997.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. &#8220;Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income&#8221; includes the revenue variance associated with these items. \n\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate increases effective November 2021 and September 2022, each in accordance with the terms of the 2021 and 2022 formula rate plan filings. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filings. \n\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in weather-adjusted residential usage, an increase in commercial usage, and the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. The increase in weather-adjusted residential usage was primarily due to the effect of Hurricane Ida in 2021. The increase in commercial usage was primarily due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in 2021. \n\nThe retail gas price variance is primarily due to a rate increase effective November 2021 in accordance with the terms of the 2021 formula rate plan filing. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filing. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy New Orleans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 % Change (GWh) Residential 2,410 2,221 9 Commercial 2,096 1,963 7 Industrial 411 413 &#8212; Governmental 789 750 5 Total retail 5,706 5,347 7 Sales for resale: Non-associated companies 2,298 2,369 (3) Total 8,004 7,716 4 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s operating revenues. \n\nOther Income Statement Variances \n\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $10.4 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to higher reliability costs, partially offset by a decrease in meter reading expenses as a result of the deployment of advanced metering systems; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $3.3 million in bad debt expense resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the deferral in 2021 of bad debt expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of regulatory activity associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $2.1 million in loss provisions. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed in 2022, including during plant outages, as compared to 2021. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in local franchise taxes and increases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. \n\nInterest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $90 million of 4.19% Series mortgage bonds and the issuance of $70 million of 4.51% Series mortgage bonds, each in November 2021. \n\nThe effective income tax rates were 27.5% for 2022 and 15.7% fo r 2021. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nIncome Tax Legislation \n\nSee the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow \n\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $42,862 $26 $6,017 Net cash provided by (used in): &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating activities 363,763 78,808 64,024 Investing activities (403,790) (169,920) (220,845) Financing activities 1,629 133,948 150,830 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (38,398) 42,836 (5,991) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $4,464 $42,862 $26 ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $285 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; net proceeds of $201.8 million received from the LURC in December 2022 from securitization. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of storm securitization; \n\n&#8226; higher collections from customers; and \n\n&#8226; the timing of payments to vendors. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by increased fuel costs, including the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $233.9 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; a net payment to the storm reserve escrow account of $75 million in 2022 compared to net receipts of $83 million from the storm reserve escrow account in 2021; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $16.3 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work on projects performed in 2022 as compared to 2021; and \n\n&#8226; money pool activity. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $8.5 million in non-nuclear generation construction expenditures primarily due to a lower scope of work on projects performed, including during plant outages, in 2022 as compared to 2021; and \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $6.4 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022 and lower spending on advanced metering infrastructure, partially offset by increased investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s distribution system. The decrease in storm restoration spending is primarily due to Hurricane Zeta and Hurricane Ida restoration efforts. See &#8220; Hurricane Zeta &#8221; and &#8220; Hurricane Ida &#8221; below for discussion of storm restoration efforts. \n\nIncreases in Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s receivable from the money pool increased $110.8 million in 2022 compared to increasing by $36.4 million in 2021. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries&#8217; need for external short-term borrowings. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased $132.3 million in 2022 primarily due to the issuance of $90 million of 4.19% Series mortgage bonds and the issuance of $70 million of 4.51% Series mortgage bonds, each in November 2021. The decrease was partially offset by a $15 million advance received in 2022 in anticipation of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s construction of a New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board substation and money pool activity. \n\nDecreases in Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s payable to the money pool decreased $10.2 million in 2021. \n\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to an increase in equity resulting from retained earnings in 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt to capital 52.6 % 55.4 % Effect of excluding securitization bonds (0.6 %) (1.0 %) Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 52.0 % 54.4 % Effect of subtracting cash (0.1 %) (1.4 %) Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 51.9 % 53.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans. \n\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable due to an associated company. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures. Entergy New Orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nsecuritization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy New Orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nEntergy New Orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy New Orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy New Orleans may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. \n\nUses of Capital \n\nEntergy New Orleans requires capital resources for: \n\n&#8226; construction and other capital investments; \n\n&#8226; working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; \n\n&#8226; debt maturities or retirements; and \n\n&#8226; distribution and interest payments. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s planned construction and other capital investments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 &#160; (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment: &#160; Generation $&#8212; $20 $25 Transmission 15 15 15 Distribution 110 160 145 Utility Support 15 15 20 Total $140 $210 $205 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s portfolio; distribution and Utility support spending to deliver reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to drive reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026-2027 After 2027 &#160; (In Millions) Long-term debt (a) $211 $32 $101 $125 $767 Operating leases (b) $2 $2 $1 $1 $1 Finance leases (b) $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. \n\n(b) Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nEntergy New Orleans currently expects to contribute approximately $1.4 million to its qualified pension plan and approximately $193 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. \n\nEntergy New Orleans has $182.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nIn addition, Entergy New Orleans enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations. Entergy New Orleans has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations. See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy New Orleans pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. \n\nRenewables \n\nIn July 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council requesting approval of three utility-scale solar projects totaling 90 MW. The resource additions will allow Entergy New Orleans to make significant progress towards meeting its voluntary commitment to the City Council to add up to 100 MW of renewable energy resources. The three projects include constructing a self-build solar plant in Orleans Parish with an output of 20 MW, acquiring a 50 MW solar facility in Washington Parish through a build-own-transfer acquisition, and procuring 20 MW of solar power from a project to be built in St. James Parish through a power purchase agreement. In December 2018 the City Council advisors requested that Entergy New Orleans pursue alternative deal structures for the Washington Parish project and attempt to reduce costs for the 20 MW New Orleans Solar Station. As a result of settlement discussions, in March 2019, Entergy New Orleans revised its application to convert the build-own transfer acquisition of the 50 MW facility in Washington Parish to a power purchase agreement. In June 2019 the parties to the proceeding executed a stipulated settlement term sheet, which recommends that the City Council approve Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s revised application as to all three projects. In July 2019 the City Council approved the stipulated settlement. Commercial operation of the 20 MW New Orleans Solar Station commenced in December 2020. In November 2022 Entergy New Orleans began receiving power under the 50 MW Iris Solar power purchase agreement. Due to a delay resulting from Hurricane Ida, Entergy New \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nOrleans now expects to begin receiving power under the 20 MW St. James Solar power purchase agreement in the first half of 2023. \n\nSystem Resilience and Storm Hardening \n\nIn October 2021 the City Council passed a resolution and order establishing a docket and procedural schedule with respect to system resiliency and storm hardening. The docket will identify a plan for storm hardening and resiliency projects with other stakeholders. In July 2022, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council a response identifying a preliminary plan for storm hardening and resiliency projects, including microgrids, to be implemented over 10 years at an approximate cost of $1.5 billion. In February 2023 the City Council approved a revised procedural schedule requiring Entergy New Orleans to make a filing in April 2023 containing a narrowed list of proposed hardening projects, with final comments on that filing due July 2023. \n\nSources of Capital \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s sources to meet its capital requirements include: \n\n&#8226; internally generated funds; \n\n&#8226; cash on hand; \n\n&#8226; the Entergy System money pool; \n\n&#8226; storm reserve escrow accounts; \n\n&#8226; debt and preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; capital contributions; and \n\n&#8226; bank financing under new or existing facilities. \n\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit. \n\nAll debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy New Orleans require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements. Entergy New Orleans has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 (In Thousands) $147,254 $36,410 ($10,190) $5,191 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. \n\nEntergy New Orleans has a credit facility in the amount of $25 million scheduled to expire in June 2024. The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $10 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2022, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, Entergy New Orleans is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO. As of December 31, 2022, a $1 million \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nletter of credit was outstanding under Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s uncommitted letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities. \n\nEntergy New Orleans obtained authorization from the FERC through October 2023 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $150 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and securities issuances. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts authorized not only by the FERC, but also by the City Council, and the current City Council authorization extends through December 2023. \n\nEntergy New Orleans had $75 million in its storm reserve escrow account at December 31, 2022. \n\nHurricane Zeta \n\nIn October 2020, Hurricane Zeta caused significant damage to Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s service area. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In March 2021, Entergy New Orleans withdrew $44 million from its funded storm reserves. In May 2021, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council requesting approval and certification that its system restoration costs associated with Hurricane Zeta of approximately $36 million, which included $7 million in estimated costs, were reasonable and necessary to enable Entergy New Orleans to restore electric service to its customers and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric utility infrastructure. In May 2022 the City Council advisors issued a report recommending that the City Council find that Entergy New Orleans acted prudently in restoring service following Hurricane Zeta and approximately $33 million in storm restoration costs were prudently incurred and recoverable. Additionally, the advisors concluded that approximately $7 million of the $44 million withdrawn from its funded storm reserve was in excess of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s costs and should be considered in Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s application for certification of costs related to Hurricane Ida. In September 2022 the City Council issued a resolution finding that Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s system restoration costs were reasonable and necessary, and that Entergy New Orleans acted prudently in restoring electricity following Hurricane Zeta. The City Council also found that approximately $33 million in storm costs were recoverable. \n\nHurricane Ida \n\nIn August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused significant damage to Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s service area, including Entergy&#8217;s electrical grid. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, including the loss of 100% of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s load and damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, including the loss of connectivity to the eastern interconnection. In September 2021, Entergy New Orleans withdrew $39 million from its funded storm reserves. In June 2022, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council requesting approval and certification that storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ida of approximately $170 million, which included $11 million in estimated costs, were reasonable, necessary, and prudently incurred to enable Entergy New Orleans to restore electric service to its customers and to repair Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric utility infrastructure. In addition, estimated carrying costs through December 2022 related to Hurricane Ida restoration costs were $9 million. Also, Entergy New Orleans is requesting approval that the $39 million withdrawal from its funded storm reserve in September 2021 and $7 million in excess storm reserve escrow withdrawals related to Hurricane Zeta and prior miscellaneous storms are properly applied to Hurricane Ida storm restoration costs, the application of which reduces the amount to be recovered from Entergy New Orleans customers by $46 million. In November 2022 the City Council adopted a procedural schedule regarding the certification of the Hurricane Ida storm restoration costs in which the hearing officer shall certify the record for City Council consideration no later than August 2023. \n\nAdditionally, in February 2022, Entergy New Orleans and the LURC filed with the City Council a securitization application requesting that the City Council review Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s storm reserve and increase the storm reserve funding level to $150 million, to be funded through securitization. In August 2022 the City \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nCouncil&#8217;s advisors recommended that the City Council authorize a single securitization bond issuance to fund Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s storm recovery reserves to an amount sufficient to: (1) allow recovery of all of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s unrecovered storm recovery costs following Hurricane Ida, subject to City Council review and certification; (2) provide initial funding of storm recovery reserves for future storms to a level of $75 million; and (3) fund the storm recovery bonds&#8217; upfront financing costs. In September 2022, Entergy New Orleans and the City Council&#8217;s advisors entered into an agreement in principle, which was approved by the City Council along with a financing order in October 2022, authorizing Entergy New Orleans and the LURC to proceed with a single securitization bond issuance of approximately $206 million (subject to further adjustment and review pursuant to the Final Issuance Advice Letter process set forth in the financing order), with $125 million of that total to be used for interim recovery, subject to City Council review and certification, to be allocated to unrecovered Hurricane Ida storm recovery costs; $75 million of that total to provide for a storm recovery reserve for future storms; and the remainder to fund the recovery of the storm recovery bonds&#8217; upfront financing costs. \n\nIn December 2022, Entergy New Orleans and the LURC filed with the City Council the Final Issuance Advice Letter for a securitization bond issuance in the amount of $209.3 million, the final structuring, terms, and pricing of which were approved by the City Council in accordance with the financing order. Also in December 2022, the LCDA issued $209.3 million in bonds pursuant to the Louisiana Electric Utility Storm Recovery Securitization Act, Part V-B of Chapter 9 of Title 45 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, as supplemented by Act 293 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2021. The LCDA loaned $201.8 million of bond proceeds, net of certain debt service and issuance costs, to the LURC. The LURC used the proceeds to purchase from Entergy New Orleans the storm recovery property, which is the right to collect storm recovery charges sufficient to pay the storm recovery bonds and associated financing costs, and Entergy New Orleans deposited $200 million in a restricted storm reserve escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy New Orleans and received directly $1.8 million in estimated upfront financing costs. Subsequently, Entergy New Orleans withdrew $125 million from the newly securitized storm reserve to cover Hurricane Ida storm recovery costs, subject to a final determination from the City Council regarding the prudency of the storm recovery costs. \n\nEntergy and Entergy New Orleans do not report the bonds issued by the LCDA on their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against Entergy or Entergy New Orleans in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy New Orleans collects a storm recovery charge on behalf of the LURC and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy and Entergy New Orleans do not report the collections as revenue because Entergy New Orleans is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the LURC. \n\nState and Local Rate Regulation \n\nThe rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. \n\nRetail Rates \n\n2018 Base Rate Case \n\nIn September 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. The filing requested a 10.5% return on equity for electric operations with opportunity to earn a 10.75% return on equity through a performance adder provision of the electric formula rate plan in subsequent years under a formula rate plan and requested a 10.75% return on equity for gas operations. The filing&#8217;s major provisions included: (1) a new electric rate structure, which realigns the revenue requirement associated with capacity and long-term service agreement expense from certain existing riders to base revenue, provides for the recovery of the cost of advanced metering infrastructure, and partially blends rates for Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s customers residing in Algiers with \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ncustomers residing in the remainder of Orleans Parish through a three-year phase-in; (2) contemporaneous cost recovery riders for investments in energy efficiency/demand response, incremental changes in capacity/long-term service agreement costs, grid modernization investment, and gas infrastructure replacement investment; and (3) formula rate plans for both electric and gas operations. \n\nIn October 2019 the City Council&#8217;s Utility Committee approved a resolution for a change in electric and gas rates for consideration by the full City Council that included a 9.35% return on common equity, an equity ratio of the lesser of 50% or Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s actual equity ratio, and a total reduction in revenues that Entergy New Orleans initially estimated to be approximately $39 million ($36 million electric; $3 million gas). At its November 7, 2019 meeting, the full City Council approved the resolution that had previously been approved by the City Council&#8217;s Utility Committee. Based on the approved resolution, in the fourth quarter 2019 Entergy New Orleans recorded an accrual of $10 million that reflects the estimate of the revenue billed in 2019 to be refunded to customers in 2020 based on an August 2019 effective date for the rate decrease. Entergy New Orleans also recorded a total of $12 million in regulatory assets for rate case costs and information technology costs associated with integrating Algiers customers with Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s legacy system and records. Entergy New Orleans will also be allowed to recover $10 million of retired general plant costs over a 20-year period. \n\nThe resolution directed Entergy New Orleans to submit a compliance filing within 30 days of the date of the resolution to facilitate the eventual implementation of rates, including all necessary calculations and conforming rate schedules and riders. The electric formula rate plan rider includes, among other things, (1) a provision for forward-looking adjustments to include known and measurable changes realized up to 12 months after the evaluation period; (2) a decoupling mechanism; and (3) recognition that Entergy New Orleans is authorized to make an in-service adjustment to the formula rate plan to include the non-fuel cost of the New Orleans Power Station in rates, unless the two pending appeals in the New Orleans Power Station proceeding have not concluded. Under this circumstance, Entergy New Orleans shall be permitted to defer the New Orleans Power Station non-fuel costs, including the cost of capital, until Entergy New Orleans commences non-fuel cost recovery. After taking into account the requirements for submission of the compliance filing, the total annual revenue requirement reduction required by the resolution was refined to approximately $45 million ($42 million electric, including $29 million in rider reductions; $3 million gas). In January 2020 the City Council&#8217;s advisors found that the rates calculated by Entergy New Orleans and reflected in the December 2019 compliance filing should be implemented, except with respect to the City Council-approved energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which rider calculation should take into account events to be determined by the City Council in the future. On February 17, 2020, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council an agreement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council&#8217;s advisors. On February 20, 2020, the City Council voted to approve the proposed agreement in principle and issued a resolution modifying the required treatment of certain accumulated deferred income taxes. As a result of the agreement in principle, the total annual revenue requirement reduction will be approximately $45 million ($42 million electric, including $29 million in rider reductions; and $3 million gas). Entergy New Orleans fully implemented the new rates in April 2020. \n\nCommercial operation of the New Orleans Power Station commenced in May 2020. In accordance with the City Council resolution issued in the 2018 base rate case proceeding, Entergy New Orleans had been deferring the New Orleans Power Station non-fuel costs pending the conclusion of the appellate proceedings. In October 2020 the Louisiana Supreme Court denied all writ applications relating to the New Orleans Power Station. With those denials, Entergy New Orleans began recovering New Orleans Power Station costs in rates in November 2020. Entergy New Orleans is recovering the costs over a five-year period that began in November 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the regulatory asset for the deferral of New Orleans Power Station non-fuel costs was $2.9 million. \n\n2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s first annual filing under the three-year formula rate plan approved by the City Council in November 2019 was originally due to be filed in April 2020. The authorized return on equity under the approved three-year formula rate plan is 9.35% for both electric and gas operations. The City Council approved \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nseveral extensions of the deadline to allow additional time to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the New Orleans community, Entergy New Orleans customers, and Entergy New Orleans itself. In October 2020 the City Council approved an agreement in principle filed by Entergy New Orleans that results in Entergy New Orleans foregoing its 2020 formula rate plan filing and shifting the three-year formula rate plan to filings in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Key provisions of the agreement in principle include: changing the lower of actual equity ratio or 50% equity ratio approved in the rate case to a hypothetical capital structure of 51% equity and 49% debt for the duration of the three-year formula rate plan; changing the 2% depreciation rate for the New Orleans Power Station approved in the rate case to 3%; retention of over-recovery of $2.2 million in rider revenues; recovery of $1.4 million of certain rate case expenses outside of the earnings band; recovery of the New Orleans Solar Station costs upon commercial operation; and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s dismissal of its 2018 rate case appeal. \n\n2021 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn July 2021, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2020 test year filing. The 2020 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on equity of 6.26% compared to the authorized return on equity of 9.35%. Entergy New Orleans sought approval of a $64 million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case. The formula resulted in an increase in authorized electric revenues of $40 million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of $18.8 million. Entergy New Orleans also sought to commence collecting $5.2 million in electric revenues and $0.3 million in gas revenues that were previously approved by the City Council for collection through the formula rate plan. The filing was subject to review by the City Council and other parties over a 75-day review period, followed by a 25-day period to resolve any disputes among the parties. In October 2021 the City Council&#8217;s advisors filed a 75-day report recommending a reduction of $10 million for electric revenues and a reduction of $4.5 million for gas revenues, along with one-time credits funded by certain electric regulatory liabilities currently held by Entergy New Orleans for customers. On October 26, 2021, Entergy New Orleans provided notice to the City Council that it intends to implement rates effective with the first billing cycle of November 2021, with such rates reflecting an amount agreed-upon by Entergy New Orleans including adjustments filed in the City Council&#8217;s 75-day report, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation. The total formula rate plan increase implemented was $49.5 million, with an increase of $34.9 million in electric revenues and $14.6 million in gas revenues. Also, credits of $17.4 million funded by certain regulatory liabilities currently held by Entergy New Orleans for customers will be issued over a five-month period from November 2021 through March 2022. Resulting rates went into effect with the first billing cycle of November 2021 pursuant to the formula rate plan tariff. \n\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing \n\nIn April 2022, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2021 test year filing. The 2021 test year evaluation report, subsequently updated in a July 2022 filing, produced an earned return on equity of 6.88% compared to the authorized return on equity of 9.35%. Entergy New Orleans sought approval of a $42.1 million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case. The formula results in an increase in authorized electric revenues of $34.1 million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of $3.3 million. Entergy New Orleans also sought to commence collecting $4.7 million in electric revenues that were previously approved by the City Council for collection through the formula rate plan. In July 2022 the City Council&#8217;s advisors issued a report seeking a reduction to Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s proposed increase of approximately $17.1 million in total for electric and gas revenues. Effective with the first billing cycle of September 2022, Entergy New Orleans implemented rates reflecting an amount agreed upon by Entergy New Orleans and the City Council including adjustments filed in the City Council&#8217;s advisors&#8217; report, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation. The total formula rate plan increase implemented was $24.7 million, which includes an increase of $18.2 million in electric revenues, $4.7 million in previously approved electric revenues, and an increase of $1.8 million in gas revenues. Additionally, credits of $13.9 million funded by certain regulatory liabilities currently held by Entergy New Orleans for customers will be issued over an eight-month period beginning September 2022. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nCOVID-19 Orders \n\nIn March 2020, Entergy New Orleans voluntarily suspended customer disconnections for non-payment of utility bills through May 2020. Subsequently, the City Council ordered that the moratorium be extended to August 1, 2020. In May 2020 the City Council issued an accounting order authorizing Entergy New Orleans to establish a regulatory asset for incremental COVID-19-related expenses. In January 2021, Entergy New Orleans resumed disconnecting service to commercial and small business customers with past-due balances that had not made payment arrangements. In February 2021 the City Council adopted a resolution suspending residential customer disconnections for non-payment of utility bills and suspending the assessment and accumulation of late fees on residential customers with past-due balances through May 15, 2021, which was not extended by the City Council. As of December 31, 2021, Entergy New Orleans had a regulatory asset of $13.9 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the 2022 formula rate plan filing, Entergy New Orleans will recover this regulatory asset over a five-year period beginning September 2023. \n\nIn June 2020 the City Council established the City Council Cares Program and directed Entergy New Orleans to use the approximately $7 million refund received from the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales FERC proceeding and approximately $15 million of non-securitized storm reserves to fund this program, which was intended to provide temporary bill relief to customers who become unemployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was effective July 1, 2020 and offered qualifying residential customers bill credits of $100 per month for up to four months, for a maximum of $400 in residential customer bill credits. Credits of $4.3 million were applied to customer bills under the City Council Cares Program. \n\nFuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. \n\nReliability Investigation \n\nIn August 2017 the City Council established a docket to investigate the reliability of the Entergy New Orleans distribution system and to consider implementing certain reliability standards and possible financial penalties for not meeting any such standards. In April 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution directing Entergy New Orleans to demonstrate that it has been prudent in the management and maintenance of the reliability of its distribution system. The resolution also called for Entergy New Orleans to file a revised reliability plan addressing the current state of its distribution system and proposing remedial measures for increasing reliability. In June 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its response to the City Council&#8217;s resolution regarding the prudence of its management and maintenance of the reliability of its distribution system. In July 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its revised reliability plan discussing the various reliability programs that it uses to improve distribution system reliability and discussing generally the positive effect that advanced meter deployment and grid modernization can have on future reliability. Entergy New Orleans retained a national consulting firm with expertise in distribution system reliability to conduct a review of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s distribution system reliability-related practices and procedures and to provide recommendations for improving distribution system reliability. The report was filed with the City Council in October 2018. The City Council also approved a resolution that opened a prudence investigation into whether Entergy New Orleans was imprudent for not acting sooner to address outages in New Orleans and whether fines should be imposed. In January 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed testimony in response to the prudence investigation asserting that it had been prudent in managing system reliability. In April 2019 the City Council \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nadvisors filed comments and testimony asserting that Entergy New Orleans did not act prudently in maintaining and improving its distribution system reliability in recent years and recommending that a financial penalty in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million should be assessed. Entergy New Orleans disagreed with the recommendation and submitted rebuttal testimony and rebuttal comments in June 2019. In November 2019 the City Council passed a resolution that penalized Entergy New Orleans $1 million for alleged imprudence in the maintenance of its distribution system. In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed suit in Louisiana state court seeking judicial review of the City Council&#8217;s resolution. In June 2022 the Orleans Civil District Court issued a written judgment that the penalty be set aside, reversed, and vacated. In August 2022 the Orleans Civil District Court issued written reasons for its judgment and also granted a post-judgment motion to remand for the City Council to take actions consistent with its judgment. \n\nAlso in August 2022 the City Council approved a resolution establishing a 30-day comment period on proposed minimum reliability standards and an associated penalty mechanism. In September 2022, Entergy New Orleans filed comments to the proposed plan including a request for an additional round of comments. \n\nRenewable Portfolio Standard Rulemaking \n\nIn March 2019 the City Council initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether to establish a renewable portfolio standard. The four components of the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard that the City Council expressed a desire to implement were: (1) a mandatory requirement that Entergy New Orleans achieve 100% net zero carbon emissions by 2040; (2) reliance on renewable energy credits purchased without the associated energy for compliance with the standard being phased out over the ten-year period from 2040 to 2050; (3) no carbon-emitting resources in the portfolio of resources Entergy New Orleans uses to serve New Orleans by 2050; and (4) a mechanism to limit costs in any one plan year to no more than one percent of plan year total utility retail sales revenues. The City Council adopted the Utility Committee resolution in April 2020. The first technical meeting of the parties occurred in June 2020; a second technical meeting occurred in July 2020. In August 2020 the City Council advisors issued a final draft of the rules for review and comment from the parties before final rules would be proposed for consideration by the City Council. Entergy New Orleans filed comments in September and October 2020. The City Council approved the draft rule, as amended, in May 2021. \n\nIn March 2022 the City Council approved Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s initial compliance plan and established an alternative compliance payment value of $8.45 per MWh, which Entergy New Orleans will pay if it is unable to comply with the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard for the 2022 compliance year. Such compliance payments are paid into a clean energy fund established by the City Council. The City Council also approved the electric vehicle credit calculation methodology for use in the compliance demonstration report for 2022, to be filed prior to May 1, 2023. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s proposal to create a 5% contingency reserve was considered reasonable for the initial compliance plan. \n\nIn August 2022, Entergy New Orleans submitted its compliance plan covering compliance years 2023-2025 requesting that the City Council (a) approve Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s proposal to purchase unbundled renewable energy credits as needed to achieve compliance with the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard; (b) approve treatment of the Sewerage and Water Board&#8217;s 230 kV Sullivan substation electrification project as a &#8220;qualified measure;&#8221; (c) establish the alternative compliance payment for years 2023-2025 at $8.45 per MWh; and (d) approve the Tier 3 credit calculations for electric vehicle charging infrastructure and for the Sewerage and Water Board Sullivan substation electrification. After receiving comments from intervenors and Entergy New Orleans, in December 2022 the City Council adopted a resolution that (a) approved Entergy New Orleans's proposal to purchase unbundled renewable energy credits, as needed; (b) denied Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s request to treat the Sewerage and Water Board&#8217;s 230 kV Sullivan substation electrification as a &#8220;qualified measure;&#8221; (c) approved the alternative compliance payment for years 2023-2025 at $8.45 per MWh; and (d) approved the Tier 3 credit calculations for electric vehicle charging infrastructure but denied the request to approve a Tier 3 credit for the Sewerage and Water Board substation electrification project at this time while the substation is not yet in service. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nLoad Shed Investigation \n\nOn February 16, 2021, due to high customer demand and limited generation, MISO issued an order requiring load-serving entities throughout its southern region to shed load to protect the integrity of the bulk electric system. Entergy New Orleans was required to shed load of at least 26 MW, but due to certain complications with its automated load shed program and certain load measurement issues, it inadvertently shed approximately 105 MW of load in its service area. The maximum time any customer was without power due to the load shed event was one hour and forty minutes. In late February 2021 the City Council ordered its advisors to conduct an investigation into the load shed event and to issue a report, which was completed and filed in April 2021. The report recommended that the City Council open an additional docket to determine whether any of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s actions were imprudent. In May 2021 the City Council opened a docket directing its advisors to conduct a prudence investigation and determine whether financial and/or other penalties should be imposed by the City Council. In June 2021, Entergy New Orleans filed a response to the show cause docket that outlined how its response to Winter Storm Uri was reasonable under the circumstances. In November 2021 the City Council&#8217;s Advisors issued a report that criticized Entergy&#8217;s response to the winter storm, including the inadvertent shedding of 105 MW of load and communications with customers. The advisors&#8217; report, however, did not find that Entergy New Orleans was imprudent and did not recommend a fine under the circumstances. In February 2022 the City Council&#8217;s advisors presented to the City Council their report and investigative findings. While the presentation was critical, it recommended remedial actions to the load shedding process and did not recommend a finding of imprudence or a fine. Entergy New Orleans would oppose any attempt to levy a fine under the circumstances presented. \n\nManagement Audit \n\nIn September 2021 the City Council issued a resolution initiating a management audit of Entergy New Orleans that has been proposed by certain solar advocates. The advocates have proposed a broad scope audit including, but not limited to, ensuring the corporate culture embraces climate solutions, employee salaries, expenses, and capital spending, but the City Council has not yet determined the full scope of the proposed audit. In September 2021 the City Council passed a resolution directing its staff to issue a request for qualifications for firms interested in conducting the audit. \n\nUtility Alternative Investigation \n\nIn September 2021 the City Council issued a resolution directing its staff to initiate a request for qualifications for a third-party firm to study alternatives to Entergy New Orleans as the electric service provider for New Orleans. Entergy responded to the City Council and issued a press release stating that it stands ready to work with the City Council to quickly implement any action taken by the City Council in response to the study. In the press release, Entergy highlighted four preliminary options that the City Council would consider: merger of Entergy New Orleans with Entergy Louisiana, sale of Entergy New Orleans, spinoff of Entergy New Orleans to establish a standalone company, or municipalization of the assets of Entergy New Orleans by the City of New Orleans. \n\nFederal Regulation \n\nSee the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#8211; Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation. \n\nNuclear Matters \n\nSee the &#8220; Nuclear Matters &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. \n\nUtility Regulatory Accounting \n\nSee &#8220; Utility Regulatory Accounting &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nSee &#8220; Impairment of Long-lived Assets &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nSee &#8220; Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. \n\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEntergy New Orleans&#8217;s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See &#8220; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy&#8217;s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nCost Sensitivity \n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on 2022 Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $135 $3,249 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $320 $&#8212; Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $128 $670 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on 2022 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $6 $544 Health care cost trend 0.25% $29 $387 ##TABLE_END\n\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. \n\nCosts and Employer Contributions \n\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2022 was $10 million, including $6.7 million in settlement costs. Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2023 qualified pension cost to be $2 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $1.1 million to its qualified pension plans in 2022 and estimates 2023 pension contributions will be approximately $1.4 million, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. \n\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy New Orleans in 2022 was $6.7 million. Entergy New Orleans expects 2023 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $4.3 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $333 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2022 and estimates 2023 contributions will be approximately $193 thousand. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nSee &#8220; Other Contingencies &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee &#8220; New Accounting Pronouncements &#8221; section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the member and Board of Directors of \n\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in member&#8217;s equity (pages 418 through 422 and applicable items in pages 53 through 245), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nRate and Regulatory Matters&#8212; Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Council of the City of New Orleans, Louisiana (the &#8220;City Council&#8221;), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in the City of New Orleans, Louisiana, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based \n\nrate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the City Council and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the City Council and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the City Council and the FERC involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the City Council and the FERC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the City Council and the FERC for the Company, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the City Council&#8217;s and the FERC&#8217;s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company&#8217;s filings with the City Council and the FERC, including the base rate case filing, and considered the filings with the City Council and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company&#8217;s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management&#8217;s assertions . \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management&#8217;s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\nSecuritization Financing&#8212;Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators&#8212;Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nIn August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused significant damage to the Company&#8217;s service area. In October 2022, the City Council issued a Financing Order authorizing the Company and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (&#8220;LURC&#8221;) to proceed with a single securitization bond issuance of approximately $206 million. In December 2022, the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (&#8220;LCDA&#8221;), a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, issued $209.3 million in bonds pursuant to the Louisiana Electric \n\nUtility Storm Recovery Securitization Act. From the $201.8 million of net bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC purchased the storm recovery property from the Company. \n\nThe Company does not report the bonds issued by the LCDA on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against the Company in the event of a default. To service the bonds, the Company collects a storm recovery charge on behalf of the LURC and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. The Company does not report the collections as revenue because the Company is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the LURC. \n\nWe identified management&#8217;s conclusion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its conclusion. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments involved especially subjective judgment and specialized knowledge of accounting for securitization financing transactions. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the securitization financing included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the accounting impact of this securitization financing transaction, including the conclusion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of the securitization financing, including the balances recorded. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant securitization regulatory and financing orders issued by the City Council for the Company, the LURC, and the LCDA, and by the Louisiana Public Service Commission for other public utilities with similar transactions, and evaluated the external information to compare to management&#8217;s conclusions. \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management regarding the legal status of the bonds issued by the LCDA and the storm recovery property to assess management&#8217;s assertion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise and experience in addressing the accounting for securitization financing transactions by regulated utilities, we evaluated the Company&#8217;s conclusion, including the conclusion that the bonds issued by the LCDA are the obligation of the LCDA. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2001. \n\n##TABLE_START ENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS &#160;

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \n\nResults of Operations \n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nNet Income \n\nNet income increased $74.5 million primarily due to higher volume/weather, higher retail electric price, and the recognition of the equity component of carrying costs as part of the securitization of the Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri system restoration costs in April 2022. The increase was partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and a higher effective income tax rate. \n\nOperating Revenues \n\nFollowing is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2022 to 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Amount &#160; (In Millions) 2021 operating revenues $1,902.5 Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income 244.8 Volume/weather 69.4 Retail electric price 50.5 System restoration carrying costs 21.7 2022 operating revenues $2,288.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. &#8220;Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income&#8221; includes the revenue variance associated with these items. \n\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,744 GWh, or 9%, in electricity usage across all customer classes, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. The increase in industrial usage was primarily due to an increase in demand from cogeneration and small industrial customers and an increase in demand from expansion projects, primarily in the transportation, primary metals, and chemicals industries. The increase in weather-adjusted residential usage was primarily due to an increase in customers. The increase in commercial usage was primarily due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in 2021. The increased usage from these industrial and commercial customers has a relatively smaller effect on operating revenues because a larger portion of the revenues from those customers comes from fixed charges. \n\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; increases in the transmission cost recovery factor rider effective March 2021 and March 2022; \n\n&#8226; an increase in the distribution cost recovery factor rider effective January 2022; and \n\n&#8226; the implementation of the generation cost recovery rider, which includes the first-year revenue requirement for the Montgomery County Power Station, effective in late January 2021 and the implementation of the \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ngeneration cost recovery relate-back rider for the Montgomery County Power Station effective August 2022. \n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the transmission and distribution cost recovery factor rider and generation cost recovery rider filings. \n\nSystem restoration carrying costs represent the equity component of system restoration carrying costs, recorded in second quarter 2022, recognized as part of the securitization of the Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri system restoration costs in April 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the securitization. \n\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Texas for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 % Change (GWh) Residential 6,779 6,156 10 Commercial 4,758 4,503 6 Industrial 9,572 8,722 10 Governmental 271 255 6 Total retail 21,380 19,636 9 Sales for resale: Associated companies 279 1,364 (80) Non-associated companies 813 1,008 (19) Total 22,472 22,008 2 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Texas&#8217;s operating revenues. \n\nOther Income Statement Variances \n\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $15.6 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance costs, higher reliability costs, and higher safety and training costs; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $5.1 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to higher costs associated with materials and supplies in 2022 as compared to 2021 and higher expenses associated with the Hardin County Peaking Facility, which was purchased in June 2021; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $3.2 million in customer service center support costs primarily due to higher contract costs; and \n\n&#8226; several individually insignificant items. \n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes, increases in gross receipts taxes, and increases in local franchise taxes, partially offset by a sales tax audit assessment in 2021. Ad valorem taxes increased as a result of higher assessments. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service. \n\nInterest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $290.85 million of senior secured system restoration bonds in April 2022 and the issuance of $325 million of 5.00% Series mortgage bonds in August 2022. The increase was partially offset by the repayment, prior to maturity, of $545.9 million of senior secured transition \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nbonds as a result of payments made on the remaining principal balance in 2022 and the repayment, at maturity, of $75 million of 4.10% Series mortgage bonds in September 2021. \n\nThe effective income tax rates were 14.3% for 2022 and 10% for 2021. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Texas&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nIncome Tax Legislation \n\nSee the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow \n\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $28 $248,596 $12,929 Net cash provided by (used in): &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating activities 409,427 356,933 375,325 Investing activities (764,069) (647,271) (848,648) Financing activities 358,111 41,770 708,990 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 3,469 (248,568) 235,667 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $3,497 $28 $248,596 ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $52.5 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; higher collections from customers; \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $27 million in storm spending in 2022, primarily due to Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri restoration efforts in 2021; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $15.7 million in income taxes paid in 2022 as a result of lower estimated income tax payments in comparison to 2021. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by increased fuel costs and the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $116.8 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; money pool activity; \n\n&#8226; the sale of a 7.56% partial interest in the Montgomery County Power Station in June 2021 for approximately $67.9 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the transaction; \n\n&#8226; an increase of $18.8 million in facilities construction expenditures primarily due to the construction of a new service facility to improve storm response and resiliency; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $18.4 million in non-nuclear generation construction expenditures primarily due to higher spending on the Orange County Advanced Power Station project, partially offset by a lower scope of work performed during outages in 2022 as compared to 2021. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $39.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2022, partially offset by higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in Entergy Texas&#8217;s service area. The decrease in storm restoration spending is primarily due to Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta restoration efforts in 2021; and \n\n&#8226; the purchase of the Hardin County Peaking Facility in June 2021 for approximately $36.7 million. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Hardin County Peaking Facility purchase. \n\nIncreases in Entergy Texas&#8217;s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas&#8217;s receivable from the money pool increased $99.5 million in 2022 compared to decreasing by $4.6 million in 2021. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries&#8217; need for external short-term borrowings. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities increased $316.3 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $325 million of 5.00% Series mortgage bonds in August 2022; \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $290.85 million of senior secured system restoration bonds in April 2022; and \n\n&#8226; the repayment, prior to maturity, of $125 million of 2.55% Series mortgage bonds in May 2021 and the repayment, at maturity, of $75 million of 4.10% Series mortgage bonds in September 2021. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by: \n\n&#8226; money pool activity; \n\n&#8226; the issuance of $130 million of 1.50% Series mortgage bonds in August 2021; \n\n&#8226; the payment of $105 million of common stock dividends in 2022. No common stock dividends were paid in 2021 in order to maintain Entergy Texas&#8217;s capital structure; and \n\n&#8226; capital contributions of $95 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2021 in order to maintain Entergy Texas&#8217;s capital structure and in anticipation of various upcoming capital expenditures. \n\nDecreases in Entergy Texas&#8217;s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas&#8217;s payable to the money pool decreased $79.6 million in 2022 compared to increasing by $79.6 million in 2021. \n\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for further details of long-term debt. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow &#8221; in Item 7 of Entergy Texas&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2022, partially offset by an increase in equity resulting from retained earnings. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt to capital 52.0 % 48.7 % Effect of excluding securitization bonds (2.5 %) (0.5 %) Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 49.5 % 48.2 % Effect of subtracting cash &#8212; % &#8212; % Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a) 49.5 % 48.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas. \n\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of finance lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures. Entergy Texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas&#8217;s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy Texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas&#8217;s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Texas&#8217;s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nEntergy Texas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Texas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, Entergy Texas may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain circumstances such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced dividends. \n\nUses of Capital \n\nEntergy Texas requires capital resources for: \n\n&#8226; construction and other capital investments; \n\n&#8226; debt maturities or retirements; \n\n&#8226; working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\n&#8226; dividend and interest payments. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Texas&#8217;s planned construction and other capital investments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 &#160; (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment: &#160; &#160; Generation $580 $495 $710 Transmission 135 240 230 Distribution 345 385 425 Utility Support 70 30 30 Total $1,130 $1,150 $1,395 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Texas includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, and diversify Entergy Texas&#8217;s portfolio, including Orange County Advanced Power Station; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to drive reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, government actions, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Texas&#8217;s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026-2027 After 2027 &#160; (In Millions) Long-term debt (a) $120 $120 $120 $517 $3,801 Operating leases (b) $6 $5 $4 $3 $1 Finance leases (b) $2 $2 $2 $2 $1 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. \n\n(b) Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nEntergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $5.3 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $86 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. \n\nEntergy Texas has $12.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nIn addition, Entergy Texas enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations. Entergy Texas has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nAs a subsidiary, Entergy Texas dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. \n\nOrange County Advanced Power Station \n\nIn September 2021, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas&#8217;s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Orange County Advanced Power Station, a new 1,215 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility to be located in Bridge City, Texas at an initially-estimated expected total cost of $1.2 billion inclusive of the estimated costs of the generation facilities, transmission upgrades, contingency, an allowance for funds used during construction, and necessary regulatory expenses, among others. The project includes combustion turbine technology with dual fuel capability, able to co-fire up to 30% hydrogen by volume upon commercial operation and upgradable to support 100% hydrogen operations in the future. In December 2021 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. In March 2022 certain intervenors filed testimony opposing the hydrogen co-firing component of the proposed project and others filed testimony opposing the project outright. Also in March 2022 the PUCT staff filed testimony opposing the hydrogen co-firing component of the proposed project, but otherwise taking no specific position on the merits of the project. The PUCT staff also proposed that the PUCT establish a maximum amount that Entergy Texas may recover in rates attributable to the project. In April 2022, Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony addressing and rebutting these various arguments. The hearing on the merits was held in June 2022, and post-hearing briefs were submitted in July 2022. In September 2022 the ALJs with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued a proposal for decision recommending the PUCT approve Entergy Texas&#8217;s application for certification of Orange County Advanced Power Station subject to certain conditions, including a cap on cost recovery at $1.37 billion, the exclusion of investment associated with co-firing hydrogen, weatherization requirements, and customer receipt of any contractual benefits associated with the facility&#8217;s guaranteed heat rate. In October 2022 the parties in the proceeding filed exceptions and replies to exceptions to the proposal for decision. Also in October 2022, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT information regarding a new fixed pricing option for an estimated project cost of approximately $1.55 billion associated with Entergy Texas&#8217;s issuance of limited notice to proceed by mid-November 2022. In November 2022 the PUCT issued a final order approving the requested amendment to Entergy Texas&#8217;s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Orange County Advanced Power Station without the investment associated with hydrogen co-firing capability, without a cap on cost recovery, and subject to certain conditions, including weatherization requirements and customer receipt of any contractual benefits associated with the facility&#8217;s guaranteed heat rate. \n\nIn December 2022, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers and Sierra Club filed motions for rehearing of the PUCT&#8217;s final order alleging the PUCT erred in granting the certification of the Orange County Advanced Power Station, in not imposing a cost cap, in including certain findings related to the reasonableness of Entergy Texas&#8217;s request for proposals from which the Orange County Advanced Power Station was selected, and in other regards. Also in December 2022, Entergy Texas filed a response to the motions for rehearing refuting the points raised therein. In January 2023 the PUCT issued letters noting that it voted to consider Texas Industrial Energy Consumers&#8217; motion for rehearing at its upcoming January 2023 open meeting and voted not to consider Sierra Club&#8217;s motion for rehearing at an open meeting. At the January 2023 open meeting, the PUCT voted to grant Texas Industrial Energy Consumers&#8217; motion for rehearing for the limited purpose of issuing an order on rehearing that excludes three findings related to Entergy Texas&#8217;s request for proposals. The order on rehearing does not change the PUCT&#8217;s certification of the Orange County Advanced Power Station or the conditions placed thereon in the PUCT&#8217;s November 2022 final order. Entergy Texas also is pursuing environmental permitting that is required prior to the commencement of construction. Subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, permits, and other conditions, the facility is expected to be in service by mid-2026. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nSources of Capital \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s sources to meet its capital requirements include: \n\n&#8226; internally generated funds; \n\n&#8226; cash on hand; \n\n&#8226; the Entergy System money pool; \n\n&#8226; debt or preferred stock issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; capital contributions; and \n\n&#8226; bank financing under new or existing facilities. \n\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy Texas expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit. \n\nAll debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements. Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 (In Thousands) $99,468 ($79,594) $4,601 $11,181 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. \n\nEntergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $150 million scheduled to expire in June 2027. The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $30 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2022, there were no cash borrowings and $1.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, Entergy Texas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO. As of December 31, 2022, $34.8 million in letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Texas&#8217;s uncommitted letter of credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities. \n\nEntergy Texas obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2023 for short-term borrowings, not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding, and long-term borrowings and security issuances. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas&#8217;s short-term borrowing limits. \n\nHurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri \n\nIn August 2020 and October 2020, Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta caused extensive damage to Entergy Texas&#8217;s service area. In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri also caused damage to Entergy Texas&#8217;s service area. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In April 2021, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT requesting a determination that approximately $250 million of system restoration costs associated with Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri, including approximately $200 million in \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ncapital costs and approximately $50 million in non-capital costs, were reasonable and necessary to enable Entergy Texas to restore electric service to its customers and Entergy Texas&#8217;s electric utility infrastructure. The filing also included the projected balance of approximately $13 million of a regulatory asset containing previously approved system restoration costs related to Hurricane Harvey. In September 2021 the parties filed an unopposed settlement agreement, pursuant to which Entergy Texas removed from the amount to be securitized approximately $4.3 million that will instead be charged to its storm reserve, $5 million related to no particular issue, of which Entergy Texas would be permitted to seek recovery in a future proceeding, and approximately $300 thousand related to attestation costs. In December 2021 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement and determining system restoration costs of $243 million related to Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri and the $13 million projected remaining balance of the Hurricane Harvey system restoration costs were eligible for securitization. The order also determines that Entergy Texas can recover carrying costs on the system restoration costs related to Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Winter Storm Uri. \n\nIn July 2021, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT an application for a financing order to approve the securitization of the system restoration costs that are the subject of the April 2021 application. In November 2021 the parties filed an unopposed settlement agreement supporting the issuance of a financing order consistent with Entergy Texas&#8217;s application and with minor adjustments to certain upfront and ongoing costs to be incurred to facilitate the issuance and serving of system restoration bonds. In January 2022 the PUCT issued a financing order consistent with the unopposed settlement. As a result of the financing order, Entergy Texas reclassified $153 million from utility plant to other regulatory assets. \n\nIn April 2022, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding II, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued $290.85 million of senior secured system restoration bonds (securitization bonds). With the proceeds, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding II purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a system restoration charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. Entergy Texas began cost recovery through the system restoration charge effective with the first billing cycle of May 2022 and the system restoration charge is expected to remain in place up to 15 years. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the April 2022 issuance of the securitization bonds. \n\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery \n\nThe rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the PUCT, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. \n\nFilings with the PUCT and Texas Cities \n\nRetail Rates \n\n2022 Base Rate Case \n\nIn July 2022, Entergy Texas filed a base rate case with the PUCT seeking a net increase in base rates of approximately $131.4 million. The base rate case was based on a 12-month test year ending December 31, 2021. Key drivers of the requested increase are changes in depreciation rates as the result of a depreciation study and an increase in the return on equity. In addition, Entergy Texas included capital additions placed into service for the period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021, including those additions currently reflected in the distribution and transmission cost recovery factor riders and the generation cost recovery rider, all of which would be reset to zero as a result of this proceeding. In July 2022 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. In October 2022 intervenors filed direct testimony challenging and supporting various aspects of Entergy Texas&#8217;s rate case application. The key issues addressed included the appropriate return on equity, generation plant deactivations, depreciation rates, and proposed tariffs related to electric vehicles. In \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nNovember 2022 the PUCT staff filed direct testimony addressing a similar set of issues and recommending a reduction of $50.7 million to Entergy Texas&#8217;s overall cost of service associated with the requested net increase in base rates of approximately $131.4 million. Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony in November 2022. In December 2022 the ALJs with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an order adopting the parties&#8217; joint proposals that the issue of rate case expenses be addressed at a separate hearing and at a later date, if requested by the parties, from the hearing on the merits initially scheduled for December 2022 and that issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure be decided exclusively on written evidence and briefing. Also in December 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a motion to abate the hearing on the merits to give parties additional time to finalize a settlement, which was approved by the ALJs with the State Office of Administrative Hearings along with an order for the parties to file monthly settlement status reports. Subsequently, the ALJs also issued an order adopting a joint proposed briefing outline and schedule with deadlines in January 2023 for the parties to submit briefing on issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure, admitting evidence related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure issues, and adopting a joint proposed procedural schedule regarding rate case expenses with a hearing in March 2023, if requested. In January 2023 the parties filed initial and reply briefs addressing issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure. A final decision by the PUCT is expected in second quarter 2023. \n\nDistribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider \n\nIn March 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF rider. The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas&#8217;s retail customers approximately $23.6 million annually, or $20.4 million in incremental annual DCRF revenue beyond Entergy Texas&#8217;s then-effective DCRF rider, based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. In May and June 2020 intervenors filed testimony recommending reductions in Entergy Texas&#8217;s annual revenue requirement of approximately $0.3 million and $4.1 million. The parties briefed the contested issues in this matter and a proposal for decision was issued in September 2020 recommending a $4.1 million revenue reduction related to non-advanced metering system meters included in the DCRF calculation. The parties filed exceptions to the proposal for decision and replies to those exceptions in September 2020. In October 2020 the PUCT issued a final order approving a $16.3 million incremental annual DCRF revenue increase, with rates effective in October 2020. \n\nIn October 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF rider. The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas&#8217;s retail customers approximately $26.3 million annually, or $6.8 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas&#8217;s then-effective DCRF rider based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. In February 2021 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings approved Entergy Texas's agreed motion for interim rates, which went into effect in March 2021. In March 2021 the parties filed an unopposed settlement recommending that Entergy Texas be allowed to collect its full requested DCRF revenue requirement and resolving all issues in the proceeding. In May 2021 the PUCT issued an order approving the settlement. \n\nIn August 2021, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF rider. The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas&#8217;s retail customers approximately $40.2 million annually, or $13.9 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas&#8217;s then-effective DCRF rider based on its capital invested in distribution between September 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. In September 2021 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. A procedural schedule was established with a hearing scheduled in December 2021. In December 2021 the parties filed an unopposed settlement recommending that Entergy Texas be allowed to collect its full requested DCRF revenue requirement and resolving all issues in the proceeding, including a motion for interim rates to take effect for usage on and after January 24, 2022. Also, in December 2021, the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an order granting the motion for interim rates, which went into effect in January 2022, admitting evidence, and remanding the proceeding to the PUCT to consider the settlement. In March 2022 the PUCT issued an order approving the settlement. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nTransmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider \n\nIn December 2018, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new TCRF rider. The new TCRF rider was designed to collect approximately $2.7 million annually from Entergy Texas&#8217;s retail customers based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2018. In April 2019 parties filed testimony proposing a load growth adjustment, which would fully offset Entergy Texas&#8217;s proposed TCRF revenue requirement. In July 2019 the PUCT granted Entergy Texas&#8217;s application as filed to begin recovery of the requested $2.7 million annual revenue requirement, rejecting opposing parties&#8217; proposed adjustment; however, the PUCT found that the question of prudence of the actual investment costs should be determined in Entergy Texas&#8217;s next rate case similar to the procedure used for the costs recovered through the DCRF rider. In October 2019 the PUCT issued an order on a motion for rehearing, clarifying and affirming its prior order granting Entergy Texas&#8217;s application as filed. Also in October 2019 a second motion for rehearing was filed, and Entergy Texas filed a response in opposition to the motion. The second motion for rehearing was overruled by operation of law. In December 2019, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed an appeal to the PUCT order in district court alleging that the PUCT erred in declining to apply a load growth adjustment. \n\nIn October 2020, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider. The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas&#8217;s retail customers approximately $51 million annually, or $31.6 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas&#8217;s then-effective TCRF rider based on its capital invested in transmission between July 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020. In March 2021 the parties filed an unopposed settlement recommending that Entergy Texas be allowed to collect its full requested TCRF revenue requirement with interim rates effective March 2021 and resolving all issues in the proceeding. In March 2021 the ALJ granted the motion for interim rates, admitted evidence, and remanded the case to the PUCT for consideration of a final order at a future open meeting. In June 2021 the PUCT issued an order approving the settlement. \n\nIn October 2021, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider. The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas&#8217;s retail customers approximately $66.1 million annually, or $15.1 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Energy Texas&#8217;s then-effective TCRF rider based on its capital invested in transmission between September 1, 2020 and July 31, 2021 and changes in approved transmission charges. In January 2022 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. In February 2022 the parties filed an unopposed settlement recommending that Entergy Texas be allowed to collect its full requested TCRF revenue requirement with interim rates effective March 2022. In February 2022 the ALJ granted the motion for interim rates, admitted evidence, and remanded the case to the PUCT for consideration of a final order at a future open meeting. In June 2022 the PUCT issued an order approving the settlement. \n\nGeneration Cost Recovery Rider \n\nIn October 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application to establish a generation cost recovery rider with an initial annual revenue requirement of approximately $91 million to begin recovering a return of and on its generation capital investment in the Montgomery County Power Station through August 31, 2020. In December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement supporting a generation cost recovery rider with an annual revenue requirement of approximately $86 million. The settlement revenue requirement was based on a depreciation rate intended to fully depreciate Montgomery County Power Station over 38 years and the removal of certain costs from Entergy Texas&#8217;s request. Under the settlement, Entergy Texas retained the right to propose a different depreciation rate and seek recovery of a majority of the costs removed from its request in its next base rate proceeding, which proceeding commenced in June 2022. On January 14, 2021, the PUCT approved the generation cost recovery rider settlement rates on an interim basis and abated the proceeding. In March 2021, Entergy Texas filed to update its generation cost recovery rider to include its generation capital investment in Montgomery County Power Station after August 31, 2020. In April 2021 the ALJ issued an order unabating the proceeding and in May 2021 the ALJ issued an order finding Entergy Texas&#8217;s application and notice of the application to be sufficient. In May 2021, Entergy Texas filed an amendment to the application to reflect the PUCT&#8217;s approval of the sale of a 7.56% partial interest in the Montgomery County Power Station to East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc., which \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nclosed in June 2021. In June 2021 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. In July 2021 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule setting a hearing on the merits for September 2021. In July 2021 the parties filed a motion to abate the procedural schedule noting they had reached an agreement in principle and to allow the parties time to finalize a settlement agreement, which motion was granted by the ALJ. In October 2021, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties an unopposed settlement agreement that would adjust its generation cost recovery rider to recover an annual revenue requirement of approximately $88.3 million related to Entergy Texas&#8217;s investment in the Montgomery County Power Station through January 1, 2021, with Entergy Texas able to seek recovery of the remainder of its investment in its next base rate case. Also in October 2021 the ALJ granted a motion to admit evidence and remand the proceeding to the PUCT. In January 2022 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement. In February 2022, Entergy Texas filed a relate-back rider to collect over five months an additional approximately $5 million, which is the difference between the interim revenue requirement approved in January 2021 and the revenue requirement approved in January 2022 that reflects Entergy Texas&#8217;s full generation capital investment and ownership in Montgomery County Power Station on January 1, 2021, plus carrying costs from January 2021 through January 2022 when the updated revenue requirement took effect. In April 2022, Entergy Texas and the PUCT staff filed a joint proposed order supporting approval of Entergy Texas&#8217;s as-filed request. The PUCT approved the relate-back rider consistent with Entergy Texas&#8217;s as-filed request, and rates became effective over a five-month period, in August 2022. \n\nIn December 2020, Entergy Texas also filed an application to amend its generation cost recovery rider to reflect its acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking Facility, which closed in June 2021. Because Hardin was to be acquired in the future, the initial generation cost recovery rider rates proposed in the application represented no change from the generation cost recovery rider rates established in Entergy Texas&#8217;s previous generation cost recovery rider proceeding. In July 2021 the PUCT issued an order approving the application. In August 2021, Entergy Texas filed an update application to recover its actual investment in the acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking Facility. In September 2021 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. A procedural schedule was established with a hearing scheduled in April 2022. In January 2022, Entergy Texas filed an update to its application to align the requested revenue requirement with the terms of the generation cost recovery rider settlement approved by the PUCT in January 2022. In March 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties an unopposed motion, which motion was granted by the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings, to abate the procedural schedule indicating that the parties had reached an agreement in principle. In April 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a unanimous settlement agreement that would adjust its generation cost recovery rider to recover an annual revenue requirement of approximately $92.8 million, which is $4.5 million in incremental annual revenue above the $88.3 million approved in January 2022, related to Entergy Texas&#8217;s actual investment in the acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking Facility. Concurrently with filing of the unanimous settlement agreement, Entergy Texas submitted an agreed motion to admit evidence and remand the case to the PUCT for review and consideration of the settlement agreement, which motion was granted by the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings. The PUCT approved the settlement agreement and rates became effective in August 2022. In September 2022, Entergy Texas filed a relate-back rider designed to collect over three months an additional approximately $5.7 million, which is the revenue requirement, plus carrying costs, associated with Entergy Texas&#8217;s acquisition of Hardin County Peaking Facility from June 2021 through August 2022 when the updated revenue requirement took effect. No party requested a hearing on the application and in November 2022 the PUCT staff filed a recommendation that the application be approved as-filed. In December 2022, Entergy Texas filed a joint motion to admit evidence, which was approved by the PUCT, and a proposed order that would approve its as-filed application. A PUCT decision is expected in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Hardin County Peaking Facility purchase. \n\nGreen Pricing Option Tariffs \n\nIn January 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application requesting approval to implement two voluntary renewable option tariffs, Rider Small Volume Renewable Option (Rider SVRO) and Rider Large Volume \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nRenewable Option (Rider LVRO). Both tariffs are voluntary offerings that give customers the ability to match some or all of their monthly electricity usage with renewable energy credits that are purchased by Entergy Texas and retired on the customer&#8217;s behalf. Voluntary participation in either Rider SVRO or Rider LVRO and the charges assessed under the respective tariff would be in addition to the charges paid by customers under their otherwise applicable rate schedules and riders. In April 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties an unopposed settlement agreement supporting approval of Entergy Texas&#8217;s proposed green pricing option tariffs. As part of the settlement agreement, Entergy Texas agreed to revise the cost allocation between the rate tiers of Rider SVRO and committed to collaborating with and considering the input of customers to develop an asset-backed green tariff program. The PUCT approved the settlement agreement in August 2022. \n\nCOVID-19 Orders \n\nIn March 2020 the PUCT authorized electric utilities to record as a regulatory asset expenses resulting from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In future proceedings, the PUCT will consider whether each utility's request for recovery of these regulatory assets is reasonable and necessary, the appropriate period of recovery, and any amount of carrying costs thereon. In March 2020 the PUCT ordered a moratorium on disconnections for nonpayment for all customer classes, but, in April 2020, revised the disconnect moratorium to apply only to residential customers. The PUCT allowed the moratorium to expire on June 13, 2020, but on July 17, 2020, the PUCT re-established the disconnect moratorium for residential customers until August 31, 2020. In January 2021, Entergy Texas resumed disconnections for customers with past-due balances that have not made payment arrangements. As of December 31, 2022, Entergy Texas had a regulatory asset of $10.4 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of its 2022 base rate case filing, Entergy Texas requested recovery of its regulatory asset over a three-year period beginning December 2022. \n\nFuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas&#8217;s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. A fuel reconciliation is required to be filed at least once every three years and outside of a base rate case filing. \n\nIn September 2019, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2016 through March 2019. During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately $1.6 billion in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments. Entergy Texas estimated an under-recovery balance of approximately $25.8 million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2019. In March 2020 an intervenor filed testimony proposing that the PUCT disallow: (1) $2 million in replacement power costs associated with generation outages during the reconciliation period; and (2) $24.4 million associated with the operation of the Spindletop natural gas storage facility during the reconciliation period. In April 2020, Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony refuting all points raised by the intervenor. In June 2020 the parties filed a stipulation and settlement agreement, which included a $1.2 million disallowance not associated with any particular issue raised by any party. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2020. \n\nIn July 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to implement an interim fuel refund of $25.5 million, including interest. Entergy Texas proposed that the interim fuel refund be implemented beginning with the first August 2020 billing cycle over a three-month period for smaller customers and in a lump sum amount in the billing month of August 2020 for transmission-level customers. The interim fuel refund was approved in July 2020, and Entergy Texas began refunds in August 2020. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nIn May 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to implement an interim fuel surcharge to collect the cumulative under-recovery of approximately $51.7 million, including interest, of fuel and purchased power costs incurred from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021. The under-recovery balance is primarily attributable to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri, including historically high natural gas prices, partially offset by settlements received by Entergy Texas from MISO related to Hurricane Laura. Entergy Texas proposed that the interim fuel surcharge be assessed over a period of six months beginning with the first billing cycle after the PUCT issues a final order, but no later than the first billing cycle of September 2022. Also in May 2022, the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. In July 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties an unopposed settlement resolving all issues in the proceeding. In addition, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a motion to admit evidence, to approve interim rates as requested in the initial application, and to remand the proceeding to the PUCT to consider the unopposed settlement. In August 2022 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an order granting Entergy Texas&#8217;s motion, approving interim rates effective with the first billing cycle of September 2022, and remanding the case to the PUCT for final approval. The interim fuel surcharge was approved by the PUCT in January 2023. \n\nIn September 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2019 through March 2022. During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately $1.7 billion in eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments. As of the end of the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas&#8217;s cumulative under-recovery balance was approximately $103.1 million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2022, pending future surcharges or refunds as approved by the PUCT. In November 2022 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule setting a hearing on the merits for May 2023. A PUCT decision is expected in September 2023. \n\nFederal Regulation \n\nSee the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#8211; Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation. \n\nNuclear Matters \n\nSee the &#8220; Nuclear Matters &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters. \n\nIndustrial and Commercial Customers \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas&#8217;s industrial customer base. Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nnoted in &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of Entergy Texas&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. \n\nUtility Regulatory Accounting \n\nSee &#8220; Utility Regulatory Accounting &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nSee &#8220; Impairment of Long-lived Assets &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nSee &#8220; Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. \n\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nEntergy Texas&#8217;s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See &#8220; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries&#8217; Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy&#8217;s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nCost Sensitivity \n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension and qualified projected benefit obligation cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on 2022 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $263 $5,673 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $604 $&#8212; Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $218 $960 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on 2022 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $89 $1,257 Health care cost trend 0.25% $176 $982 ##TABLE_END\n\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. \n\nCosts and Employer Contributions \n\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2022 was $29.8 million, including $22.4 million in settlement costs. Entergy Texas anticipates 2023 qualified pension cost to be $4.4 million. Entergy Texas contributed $2.5 million to its qualified pension plans in 2022 and estimates 2023 pension contributions will be approximately $5.3 million, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. \n\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Texas in 2022 was $11.1 million. Entergy Texas expects 2023 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $8.8 million. In 2022, Entergy Texas&#8217; contributions (that is, contributions to the external trusts plus claims payments) were offset by trust claims reimbursements, resulting in a net reimbursement of $23 thousand. Entergy Texas estimates that 2023 contributions will be approximately $86 thousand. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nSee &#8220; Other Contingencies &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee &#8220; New Accounting Pronouncements &#8221; section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and Board of Directors of \n\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in equity (pages 441 through 446 and applicable items in pages 53 through 245), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRate and Regulatory Matters &#8212;Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the &#8220;PUCT&#8221;), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Texas, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the PUCT and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the PUCT and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the PUCT and the FERC, involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the PUCT and the FERC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the PUCT and the FERC for the Company, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the PUCT&#8217;s and the FERC&#8217;s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management&#8217;s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n&#8226; For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company&#8217;s filings with the PUCT and the FERC, including the base rate case filing, and considered the filings with the PUCT and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company&#8217;s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management&#8217;s assertions . \n\n&#8226; We obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management&#8217;s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2001. \n\n##TABLE_START ENTERGY TEXAS, INC.

The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy&#8217;s only source of operating revenues. As discussed in &#8220; Complaints Against System Energy &#8221; below, System Energy is currently involved in proceedings at the FERC commenced by the retail regulators of its customers regarding its return on equity, its capital structure, its renewal of the sale-leaseback of 11.5% of Grand Gulf, the treatment of uncertain tax positions in rate base, the prudence of its operations on Grand Gulf, and the rates it charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The claims in these proceedings include claims for refunds and claims for rate adjustments; the aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the net book value of System Energy. In the event of an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings requiring the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would be required to seek financing to pay such refunds which may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of these proceedings. \n\nResults of Operations \n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nNet Income \n\nSystem Energy experienced a net loss of $276.6 million in 2022 compared to net income of $106.8 million in 2021 primarily due to a regulatory charge of $551 million ($413 million net-of-tax) recorded in the second quarter 2022 to reflect the effects of the settlement agreement with the MPSC and offer of settlement to the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council related to pending proceedings before the FERC . Partially offsetting the charge against System Energy&#8217;s earnings was an increase in revenues resulting from increases in base rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the partial settlement agreement. See &#8220; Complaints Against System Energy &#8221; below for further discussion of these items, the effects of the December 2022 FERC orders, and other proceedings involving System Energy at the FERC. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe effective income tax rates w ere 25.1% f or 2022 and (1.9%) for 2021. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations &#8221; in Item 7 of System Energy&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nIncome Tax Legislation \n\nSee the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash Flow \n\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $89,201 $242,469 $68,534 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 7,280 201,211 (145,462) Investing activities (264,184) (193,392) (206,443) Financing activities 170,643 (161,087) 525,840 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (86,261) (153,268) 173,935 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $2,940 $89,201 $242,469 ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOperating Activities \n\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $193.9 million in 2022 primarily due to the refund of $235 million to Entergy Mississippi as a result of the settlement with the MPSC and an increase in spending of $34.8 million on nuclear refueling outage costs in 2022 as compared to prior year, partially offset by a decrease of $36.5 million in income taxes paid in 2022 and timin g of collections of receivables. System Energy made income tax payments of $18.4 million in 2022 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. System Energy made income tax payments of $55 million in 2021, which included payments made as a result of the amended Mississippi tax returns filed based on federal adjustments related to the resolution of the 2014-2015 IRS audit and additional payments made in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement.

See Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2014-2015 IRS audit. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased by $70.8 million in 2022 primarily due to: \n\n&#8226; an increase of $65.8 million in nuclear construction expenditures as a result of spending in 2022 on Grand Gulf outage projects and upgrades; and \n\n&#8226; an increase of $54.3 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle. \n\nThe increase was partially offset by money pool activity. \n\nIncreases in System Energy&#8217;s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow and System Energy&#8217;s receivable from the money pool increased $19.2 million in 2022 compared to increasing by $71.7 million in 2021. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries&#8217; need for external short-term borrowings. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s financing activities provided $170.6 million of cash in 2022 compared to using $161.1 million of cash in 2021 primarily due to the following activity: \n\n&#8226; a $135 million capital contribution from Entergy Corporation in 2022 primarily to fund the settlement payment to Entergy Mississippi; \n\n&#8226; the repayment in February 2021 of $100 million of 3.42% Series J notes by the System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity; and \n\n&#8226; a decrease of $96 million in common stock dividends and distributions. No common stock dividends or distributions were made in 2022 in order to maintain System Energy&#8217;s capital structure and in anticipation of the settlement with the MPSC. \n\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details of long-term debt. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nSee &#8220; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flow &#8221; in Item 7 of System Energy&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nCapital Structure \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the net loss in 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt to capital 45.0 % 40.4 % Effect of subtracting cash (0.1 %) (3.0 %) Net debt to net capital (non-GAAP) 44.9 % 37.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy&#8217;s financial condition. The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy&#8217;s financial condition because net debt indicates System Energy&#8217;s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. \n\nSystem Energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend or a capital distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or a combination of the three, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments and other uses of cash such as the payment of expenses in the ordinary course, System Energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure. In addition, System Energy may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain circumstances that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced dividends. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nUses of Capital \n\nSystem Energy requires capital resources for: \n\n&#8226; construction and other capital investments; \n\n&#8226; debt maturities or retirements; \n\n&#8226; working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs and tax payments; and \n\n&#8226; dividend, distribution, and interest payments. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of System Energy&#8217;s planned construction and other capital investments. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 &#160; (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment: &#160; &#160; Generation $135 $190 $135 Utility Support 20 15 15 Total $155 $205 $150 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes amounts associated with Grand Gulf investments and initiatives. \n\nFollowing are the amounts of System Energy&#8217;s existing debt obligations (includes estimated interest payments). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2023 2024 2025 2026-2027 After 2027 &#160; (In Millions) Long-term debt (a) $332 $27 $298 $131 $271 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nSystem Energy expects to contribute approximately $15.5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $26 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2023, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. See &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. \n\nSystem Energy has no unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. \n\nIn addition, System Energy enters into nuclear fuel purchase agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations. As discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, System Energy recovers these costs through charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nSources of Capital \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s sources to meet its capital requirements include: \n\n&#8226; internally generated funds; \n\n&#8226; cash on hand; \n\n&#8226; the Entergy System money pool; \n\n&#8226; debt issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; equity contributions; and \n\n&#8226; bank financing under new or existing facilities. \n\nCircumstances such fuel and purchased power price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, System Energy expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit. \n\nAll debt issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond. \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 2019 (In Thousands) $94,981 $75,745 $4,004 $59,298 ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. \n\nThe System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $120 million scheduled to expire in June 2025. As of December 31, 2022, $72.6 million in loans were outstanding under the System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the variable interest entity credit facility. \n\nSystem Energy obtained authorizations from the FERC through October 2023 for the following: \n\n&#8226; short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding; \n\n&#8226; long-term borrowings and security issuances not to exceed an aggregate amount of $1,090 million at any time outstanding; and \n\n&#8226; borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity. \n\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy&#8217;s short-term borrowing limits. \n\nFederal Regulation \n\nSee the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#8211; Federal Regulation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nComplaints Against System Energy \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. System Energy and the Unit Power Sales Agreement are currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including challenges with respect to System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity and capital structure, renewal of its sale-leaseback arrangement, treatment of uncertain tax positions, a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, and a prudence complaint challenging the extended power uprate completed at Grand Gulf in 2012 and the operation and management of Grand Gulf, particularly in the 2016-2020 time period. The claims in these proceedings include claims for refunds and claims for rate adjustments; the aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the net book value of System Energy. Following are discussions of the proceedings. \n\nReturn on Equity and Capital Structure Complaints \n\nIn January 2017 the APSC and MPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy. The complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. Entergy Arkansas also sells some of its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under separate agreements. The current return on equity under the Unit Power Sales Agreement is 10.94%, which was established in a rate proceeding that became final in July 2001. As discussed below in &#8220; System Energy Settlement with the MPSC ,&#8221; beginning with the July 2022 service month, bills issued to Entergy Mississippi under the Unit Power Sales Agreement reflect a return on equity of 9.65%. \n\nThe APSC and MPSC complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and unreasonable because capital market and other considerations indicate that it is excessive. The complaint requests proceedings to investigate the return on equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the FERC establish January 23, 2017 as a refund effective date. The complaint includes return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of reasonable return on equity for System Energy is between 8.37% and 8.67%. System Energy answered the complaint in February 2017 and disputes that a return on equity of 8.37% to 8.67% is just and reasonable. The LPSC and the City Council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the complaint. In September 2017 the FERC established a refund effective date of January 23, 2017 and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings before an ALJ. The parties were unable to settle the return on equity issue and a FERC hearing judge was assigned in July 2018. The 15-month refund period in connection with the APSC/MPSC complaint expired on April 23, 2018. \n\nIn April 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy seeking an additional 15-month refund period. The LPSC complaint requests similar relief from the FERC with respect to System Energy&#8217;s return on equity and also requests the FERC to investigate System Energy&#8217;s capital structure. The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding, filed an answer expressing support for the complaint, and asked the FERC to consolidate this proceeding with the proceeding initiated by the complaint of the APSC and MPSC in January 2017. System Energy answered the LPSC complaint in May 2018 and also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In August 2018 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC&#8217;s request to investigate System Energy&#8217;s capital structure and setting for hearing the return on equity complaint, with a refund effective date of April 27, 2018. The 15-month refund period in connection with the LPSC return on equity complaint expired on July 26, 2019. \n\nThe portion of the LPSC&#8217;s complaint dealing with return on equity was subsequently consolidated with the APSC and MPSC complaint for hearing. The parties addressed an order (issued in a separate FERC proceeding involving New England transmission owners) that proposed modifying the FERC&#8217;s standard methodology for \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ndetermining return on equity. In September 2018, System Energy filed a request for rehearing and the LPSC filed a request for rehearing or reconsideration of the FERC&#8217;s August 2018 order. The LPSC&#8217;s request referenced an amended complaint that it filed on the same day raising the same capital structure claim the FERC had earlier dismissed. The FERC initiated a new proceeding for the amended capital structure complaint, and System Energy submitted a response in October 2018. In January 2019 the FERC set the amended complaint for settlement and hearing proceedings. Settlement proceedings in the capital structure proceeding commenced in February 2019. As noted below, in June 2019 settlement discussions were terminated and the amended capital structure complaint was consolidated with the ongoing return on equity proceeding. The 15-month refund period in connection with the capital structure complaint was from September 24, 2018 to December 23, 2019. \n\nIn January 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed direct testimony in the return on equity proceeding. For the refund period January 23, 2017 through April 23, 2018, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.81% and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.24%. For the refund period April 27, 2018 through July 27, 2019, and for application on a prospective basis, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.97% and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.41%. In March 2019, System Energy submitted answering testimony. For the first refund period, System Energy&#8217;s testimony argues for a return on equity of 10.10% (median) or 10.70% (midpoint). For the second refund period, System Energy&#8217;s testimony shows that the calculated returns on equity for the first period fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity, and thus the second complaint should be dismissed (and the first period return on equity used going forward). If the FERC nonetheless were to set a new return on equity for the second period (and going forward), System Energy argues the return on equity should be either 10.32% (median) or 10.69% (midpoint). \n\nIn May 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its direct and answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding. For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 9.89% based on the application of FERC&#8217;s proposed methodology. The FERC trial staff&#8217;s direct and answering testimony noted that an authorized return on equity of 9.89% for the first refund period was within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period, as calculated using a study period ending January 31, 2019 for the second refund period. \n\nIn June 2019, System Energy filed testimony responding to the testimony filed by the FERC trial staff. Among other things, System Energy&#8217;s testimony rebutted arguments raised by the FERC trial staff and provided updated calculations for the second refund period based on the study period ending May 31, 2019. For that refund period, System Energy&#8217;s testimony shows that strict application of the return on equity methodology proposed by the FERC staff indicates that the second complaint would not be dismissed, and the new return on equity would be set at 9.65% (median) or 9.74% (midpoint). System Energy&#8217;s testimony argues that these results are insufficient in light of benchmarks such as state returns on equity and treasury bond yields, and instead proposes that the calculated returns on equity for the second period should be either 9.91% (median) or 10.3% (midpoint). System Energy&#8217;s testimony also argues that, under application of its proposed modified methodology, the 10.10% return on equity calculated for the first refund period would fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period. \n\nAlso in June 2019, the FERC&#8217;s Chief ALJ issued an order terminating settlement discussions in the amended complaint addressing System Energy&#8217;s capital structure. The ALJ consolidated the amended capital structure complaint with the ongoing return on equity proceeding and set new procedural deadlines for the consolidated hearing. \n\nIn August 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding and direct and answering testimony relating to System Energy&#8217;s capital structure. The LPSC re-argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.81% for the first refund period and 7.97% for the second refund period. The APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.26% for the first refund period and 8.32% for the second refund period. With respect to capital structure, the LPSC proposes \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nthat the FERC establish a hypothetical capital structure for System Energy for ratemaking purposes. Specifically, the LPSC proposes that System Energy&#8217;s common equity ratio be set to Entergy Corporation&#8217;s equity ratio of 37% equity and 63% debt. In the alternative, the LPSC argues that the equity ratio should be no higher than 49%, the composite equity ratio of System Energy and the other Entergy operating companies who purchase under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The APSC and MPSC recommend that 35.98% be set as the common equity ratio for System Energy. As an alternative, the APSC and MPSC propose that System Energy&#8217;s common equity be set at 46.75% based on the median equity ratio of the proxy group for setting the return on equity. \n\nIn September 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding. For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 9.40% based on the application of the FERC&#8217;s proposed methodology and an updated proxy group. For the second refund period, based on the study period ending May 31, 2019, the FERC trial staff rebuttal testimony argues for a return on equity of 9.63%. In September 2019 the FERC trial staff also filed direct and answering testimony relating to System Energy&#8217;s capital structure. The FERC trial staff argues that the average capital structure of the proxy group used to develop System Energy&#8217;s return on equity should be used to establish the capital structure. Using this approach, the FERC trial staff calculates the average capital structure for its proposed proxy group of 46.74% common equity, and 53.26% debt. \n\nIn October 2019, System Energy filed answering testimony disputing the FERC trial staff&#8217;s, the LPSC&#8217;s, and the APSC&#8217;s and MPSC&#8217;s arguments for the use of a hypothetical capital structure and arguing that the use of System Energy&#8217;s actual capital structure is just and reasonable. \n\nIn November 2019, in a proceeding that did not involve System Energy, the FERC issued an order addressing the methodology for determining the return on equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO. Thereafter, the procedural schedule in the System Energy proceeding was amended to allow the participants to file supplemental testimony addressing the order in the MISO transmission owner proceeding (Opinion No. 569). \n\nIn February 2020 the LPSC, the MPSC and APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569 and how it would affect the return on equity evaluation for the two complaint periods concerning System Energy. For the first refund period, based on their respective interpretations and applications of the Opinion No. 569 methodology, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 8.44%; the MPSC and APSC argue for an authorized return on equity of 8.41%; and the FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.22%. For the second refund period and on a prospective basis, based on their respective interpretations and applications of the Opinion No. 569 methodology, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.89%; the MPSC and APSC argue that an authorized return on equity of 8.01% may be appropriate; and the FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity of 8.66%. \n\nIn April 2020, System Energy filed supplemental answering testimony addressing Opinion No. 569. System Energy argues that the Opinion No. 569 methodology is conceptually and analytically defective for purposes of establishing just and reasonable authorized return on equity determinations and proposes an alternative approach. As its primary recommendation, System Energy continues to support the return on equity determinations in its March 2019 testimony for the first refund period and its June 2019 testimony for the second refund period. Under the Opinion No. 569 methodology, System Energy calculates a &#8220;presumptively just and reasonable range&#8221; for the authorized return on equity for the first refund period of 8.57% to 9.52%, and for the second refund period of 8.28% to 9.11%. System Energy argues that these ranges are not just and reasonable results. Under its proposed alternative methodology, System Energy calculates an authorized return on equity of 10.26% for the first refund period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable range calculated for the second refund period and prospectively. \n\nIn May 2020 the FERC issued an order on rehearing of Opinion No. 569 (Opinion No. 569-A). In June 2020 the procedural schedule in the System Energy proceeding was further revised in order to allow parties to address the Opinion No. 569-A methodology. Pursuant to the revised schedule, in June 2020, the LPSC, MPSC and \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nAPSC, and the FERC trial staff filed supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569-A and how it would affect the return on equity evaluation for the two complaint periods concerning System Energy. For the first refund period, based on their respective interpretations and applications of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.97%; the MPSC and APSC argue for an authorized return on equity of 9.24%; and the FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.49%. For the second refund period and on a prospective basis, based on their respective interpretations and applications of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of 7.78%; the MPSC and APSC argue that an authorized return on equity of 9.15% may be appropriate if the second complaint is not dismissed; and the FERC trial staff argues for an authorized return on equity of 9.09% if the second complaint is not dismissed. \n\nPursuant to the revised procedural schedule, in July 2020, System Energy filed supplemental testimony addressing Opinion No. 569-A. System Energy argues that strict application of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology produces results inconsistent with investor requirements and does not provide a sound basis on which to evaluate System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity. As its primary recommendation, System Energy argues for the use of a methodology that incorporates four separate financial models, including the constant growth form of the discounted cash flow model and the empirical capital asset pricing model. Based on application of its recommended methodology, System Energy argues for an authorized return on equity of 10.12% for the first refund period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable range calculated for the second refund period and prospectively. Under the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, System Energy calculates an authorized return on equity of 9.44% for the first refund period, which also falls within the presumptively just and reasonable range calculated for the second refund period and prospectively. \n\nThe parties and FERC trial staff filed final rounds of testimony in August 2020. The hearing before a FERC ALJ occurred in late-September through early-October 2020, post-hearing briefing took place in November and December 2020. \n\nIn March 2021 the FERC ALJ issued an initial decision. With regard to System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity, the ALJ determined that the existing return on equity of 10.94% is no longer just and reasonable, and that the replacement authorized return on equity, based on application of the Opinion No. 569-A methodology, should be 9.32%. The ALJ further determined that System Energy should pay refunds for a fifteen-month refund period (January 2017-April 2018) based on the difference between the current return on equity and the replacement authorized return on equity. The ALJ determined that the April 2018 complaint concerning the authorized return on equity should be dismissed, and that no refunds for a second fifteen-month refund period should be due. With regard to System Energy&#8217;s capital structure, the ALJ determined that System Energy&#8217;s actual equity ratio is excessive and that the just and reasonable equity ratio is 48.15% equity, based on the average equity ratio of the proxy group used to evaluate the return on equity for the second complaint. The ALJ further determined that System Energy should pay refunds for a fifteen-month refund period (September 2018-December 2019) based on the difference between the actual equity ratio and the 48.15% equity ratio. If the ALJ&#8217;s initial decision is upheld, the estimated refund for this proceeding is approximately $63 million, which includes interest through December 31, 2022, and the estimated resulting annual rate reduction would be approximately $35 million. The estimated refund will continue to accrue interest until a final FERC decision is issued. \n\nThe ALJ initial decision is an interim step in the FERC litigation process , and an ALJ&#8217;s determinations made in an initial decision are not controlling on the FERC . In April 2021, System Energy filed its brief on exceptions, in which it challenged the initial decision&#8217;s findings on both the return on equity and capital structure issues. Also in April 2021 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, City Council, and the FERC trial staff filed briefs on exceptions. Reply briefs opposing exceptions were filed in May 2021 by System Energy, the FERC trial staff, the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and the City Council. Refunds, if any, that might be required will only become due after the FERC issues its order reviewing the initial decision. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nAs discussed in &#8220; System Energy Settlement with the MPSC &#8221; below, beginning with the July 2022 service month, bills issued to Entergy Mississippi under the Unit Power Sales Agreement were adjusted to reflect a capital structure not to exceed 52% equity. \n\nIn August 2022 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order addressing appeals of FERC&#8217;s Opinion No. 569 and 569-A, which established the methodology applied in the ALJ&#8217;s initial decision in the proceeding against System Energy discussed above. The appellate order addressed the methodology for determining the return on equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO. The D.C. Circuit found the FERC&#8217;s use of the Risk Premium model as part of the methodology to be arbitrary and capricious, and remanded the case back to the FERC. The remanded case is pending FERC action. \n\nGrand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate Base Issue \n\nIn May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy Services related to System Energy&#8217;s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction originally entered into in December 1988 for an 11.5% undivided interest in Grand Gulf Unit 1. The complaint alleges that System Energy violated the filed rate and the FERC&#8217;s ratemaking and accounting requirements when it included in Unit Power Sales Agreement billings the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest, and that System Energy is double-recovering costs by including both the lease payments and the capital additions in Unit Power Sales Agreement billings. The complaint also claims that System Energy was imprudent in entering into the sale-leaseback renewal because the Utility operating companies that purchase Grand Gulf&#8217;s output from System Energy could have obtained cheaper capacity and energy in the MISO markets. The complaint further alleges that System Energy violated various other reporting and accounting requirements and should have sought prior FERC approval of the lease renewal. The complaint seeks various forms of relief from the FERC. The complaint seeks refunds for capital addition costs for all years in which they were recorded in allegedly non-formula accounts or, alternatively, the disallowance of the return on equity for the capital additions in those years plus interest. The complaint also asks that the FERC disallow and refund the lease costs of the sale-leaseback renewal on grounds of imprudence, investigate System Energy&#8217;s treatment of a DOE litigation payment, and impose certain forward-looking procedural protections, including audit rights for retail regulators of the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rates. The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding. \n\nIn June 2018, System Energy and Entergy Services filed a motion to dismiss and an answer to the LPSC complaint denying that System Energy&#8217;s treatment of the sale-leaseback renewal and capital additions violated the terms of the filed rate or any other FERC ratemaking, accounting, or legal requirements or otherwise constituted double recovery. The response also argued that the complaint is inconsistent with a FERC-approved settlement to which the LPSC is a party and that explicitly authorizes System Energy to recover its lease payments. Finally, the response argued that both the capital additions and the sale-leaseback renewal were prudent investments and the LPSC complaint fails to justify any disallowance or refunds. The response also offered to submit formula rate protocols for the Unit Power Sales Agreement similar to the procedures used for reviewing transmission rates under the MISO tariff. In September 2018 the FERC issued an order setting the complaint for hearing and settlement proceedings. The FERC established a refund effective date of May 18, 2018. \n\nIn February 2019 the presiding ALJ ruled that the hearing ordered by the FERC includes the issue of whether specific subcategories of accumulated deferred income tax should be included in, or excluded from, System Energy&#8217;s formula rate. In March 2019 the LPSC, MPSC, APSC and City Council filed direct testimony. The LPSC testimony sought refunds that include the renewal lease payments (approximately $17.2 million per year since July 2015), rate base reductions for accumulated deferred income tax associated with uncertain tax positions, and the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest, as well as interest on those amounts. \n\nIn June 2019 System Energy filed answering testimony arguing that the FERC should reject all claims for refunds. Among other things, System Energy argued that claims for refunds of the costs of lease renewal payments and capital additions should be rejected because those costs were recovered consistent with the Unit Power Sales \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nAgreement formula rate, System Energy was not over or double recovering any costs, and ratepayers will save costs over the initial and renewal terms of the leases. System Energy argued that claims for refunds associated with liabilities arising from uncertain tax positions should be rejected because the liabilities do not provide cost-free capital, the repayment timing of the liabilities is uncertain, and the outcome of the underlying tax positions is uncertain. System Energy&#8217;s testimony also challenged the refund calculations supplied by the other parties. \n\nIn August 2019 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony seeking refunds for rate base reductions for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The FERC trial staff also argued that System Energy recovered $32 million more than it should have in depreciation expense for capital additions. In September 2019, System Energy filed cross-answering testimony disputing the FERC trial staff&#8217;s arguments for refunds, stating that the FERC trial staff&#8217;s position regarding depreciation rates for capital additions is not unreasonable, but explaining that any change in depreciation expense is only one element of a Unit Power Sales Agreement re-billing calculation. Adjustments to depreciation expense in any re-billing under the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate will also involve changes to accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula elements as needed. In October 2019 the LPSC filed rebuttal testimony increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. &#160; The LPSC seeks approximately $512 million plus interest, which is approximately $248 million through December 31, 2022. &#160; T he FERC trial staff also filed rebuttal testimony in which it seeks refunds of a similar amount as the LPSC for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The LPSC testimony also argued that adjustments to depreciation rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only. \n\nA hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019. In April 2020 the ALJ issued the initial decision. Among other things, the ALJ determined that refunds were due on three main issues. First, with regard to the lease renewal payments, the ALJ determined that System Energy is recovering an unjust acquisition premium through the lease renewal payments, and that System Energy&#8217;s recovery from customers through rates should be limited to the cost of service based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, which is approximately $70 million. The ALJ found that the remedy for this issue should be the refund of lease payments (approximately $17.2 million per year since July 2015) with interest determined at the FERC quarterly interest rate, which would be offset by the addition of the net book value of the leased assets in the cost of service. The ALJ did not calculate a value for the refund expected as a result of this remedy. In addition, System Energy would no longer recover the lease payments in rates prospectiv ely. Second, with regard to the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, the ALJ determined that the liabilities are accumulated deferred income taxes and that System Energy&#8217;s rate base should have been reduced for those liabilities. The ALJ also found that System Energy should include liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as a ra te base reduction going forward. Third, with regard to the depreciation expense adjustments, the ALJ found that System Energy should correct for the error in re-billings retroactively and prospectively, but that System Energy should not be permitted to recover interest on any retroactive return on enhanced rate base resulting from such corrections. \n\nIn June 2020, System Energy, the LPSC, and the FERC trial staff filed briefs on exceptions, challenging several of the initial decision&#8217;s findings. System Energy&#8217;s brief on exceptions challenged the initial decision&#8217;s limitations on recovery of the lease renewal payments, its proposed rate base refund for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions, and its proposal to asymmetrically treat interest on bill corrections for depreciation expense adjustments. The LPSC&#8217;s and the FERC trial staff&#8217;s briefs on exceptions each challenged the initial decision&#8217;s allowance for recovery of the cost of service associated with the lease renewal based on the remaining net book value of the leased assets, its calculation of the remaining net book value of the leased assets, and the amount of the initial decision&#8217;s proposed rate base refund for the liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. The LPSC&#8217;s brief on exceptions also challenged the initial decision&#8217;s proposal that depreciation expense adjustments include retroactive adjustments to rate base and its finding that section 203 of the Federal Power Act did not apply to the lease renewal. The FERC trial staff&#8217;s brief on exceptions also challenged the initial decision&#8217;s finding that the FERC need not institute a formal investigation into System Energy&#8217;s tariff. In October 2020, System Energy, the LPSC, the MPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed briefs opposing exceptions. System Energy opposed the exceptions filed by the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. The LPSC, MPSC, APSC, City Council, and the FERC trial \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nstaff opposed the exceptions filed by System Energy. Also in October 2020 the MPSC, APSC, and the City Council filed briefs adopting the exceptions of the LPSC and the FERC trial staff. \n\nIn addition, in September 2020, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) and Entergy executed it. The NOPA memorializes the IRS&#8217;s decision to adjust the 2015 consolidated federal income tax return of Entergy Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, including System Energy, with regard to the uncertain decommissioning tax position. Pursuant to the audit resolution documented in the NOPA, the IRS allowed System Energy&#8217;s inclusion of $102 million of future nuclear decommissioning costs in System Energy&#8217;s cost of goods sold for the 2015 tax year, roughly 10% of the requested deduction, but disallowed the balance of the position. In September 2020, System Energy filed a motion to lodge the NOPA into the record in the FERC proceeding. In October 2020 the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the FERC trial staff filed oppositions to System Energy&#8217;s motion. As a result of the NOPA issued by the IRS in September 2020, System Energy filed, in October 2020, a new Federal Power Act section 205 filing at FERC to establish an ongoing rate base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning uncertain tax position. On a prospective basis beginning with the October 2020 bill, System Energy proposes to include the accumulated deferred income taxes arising from the successful portion of the decommissioning uncertain tax position as a credit to rate base under the Unit Power Sales Agre ement. In November 2020 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the filing, and System Ene rgy responded. \n\nIn November 2020 the IRS issued a Revenue Agent&#8217;s Report (RAR) for the 2014/2015 tax year and in December 2020 Entergy executed it. The RAR contained the same adjustment to the uncertain nuclear decommissioning tax position as that which the IRS had announced in the NOPA. In December 2020, System Energy filed a motion to lodge the RAR into the record in the FERC proceeding addressing the uncertain tax position rate base is sue. In January 2021 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the motion. \n\nAs a result of the RAR, in December 2020, System Energy filed amendments to its new Federal Power Act section 205 filings to establish an ongoing rate base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning uncertain tax position and to credit excess accumulated deferred income taxes arising from the successful portion of the decommissioning uncertain tax position. The amendments both propose the inclusion of the RAR as support for the filings. In December 2020 the LPSC, APSC, and City Council filed a protest in response to the amendments, reiterating their prior objections to the filings. In February 2021 the FERC issued an order accepting System Energy&#8217;s Federal Power Act section 205 filings subject to refund, setting them for hearing, and holding the hearing in abeyance. \n\nIn December 2020, System Energy filed a new Federal Power Act section 205 filing to provide a one-time, historical credit of $25.2 million for the accumulated deferred income taxes that would have been created by the decommissioning uncertain tax position if the IRS&#8217;s decision had been known in 2016. In January 2021 the LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and City Council filed a protest to the filing. In February 2021 the FERC issued an order accepting System Energy&#8217;s Federal Power Act section 205 filing subject to refund, setting it for hearing, and holding the hearing in abeyance. The one-time credit was made during the first quarter 2021. \n\nIn December 2022 the FERC issued an order on the ALJ&#8217;s initial decision, which affirmed it in part and modified it in part. The FERC&#8217;s order directed System Energy to calculate refunds on three issues, and to provide a compliance report detailing the calculations. The FERC&#8217;s order also disallows the future recovery of sale-leaseback renewal costs, which is estimate d at approximately $11.5 million annually for purchases from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans through July 2036. The three refund issues are rental expenses related to the renewal of the sale-leaseback arrangements; refunds, if any, for the revenue requirement impact of including accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the decommissioning uncertain tax positions from 2004 through the present; and refunds for the net effect of correcting the depreciation inputs for capital additions. \n\nIn January 2023, System Energy filed its compliance report with the FERC. With respect to the sale-leaseback renewal costs, System Energy calculated a refund of $89.8 million, which represented all of the sale- \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nleaseback renewal rental costs that System Energy recovered in rates, with interest. With respect to the decommissioning uncertain tax position issue, System Energy calculated that no additional refunds are owed because it had already provided a one-time historical credit (for the period January 2016 through September 2020) of $25.2 million based on the accumulated deferred income taxes that resulted from the IRS&#8217;s partial acceptance of the decommissioning tax position, and because it has been providing an ongoing rate base credit for the accumulated deferred income taxes that resulted from the IRS&#8217;s partial acceptance of the decommissioning tax position since October 2020. With respect to the depreciation refund, System Energy calculated a refund of $13.7 million, which is the net total of a refund to customers for excess depreciation expense previously collected, plus interest, offset by the additional return on rate base that System Energy previously did not collect, without interest. See &#8220; System Energy Settlement with the MPSC &#8221; below for discussion of the regulatory charge and corresponding regulatory liability recorded in June 2022 related to these proceedings. The $103.5 million in total refunds calculated in the compliance filing were reclassified from long-term other regulatory liabilities to a current regulatory liability as of December 31, 2022. In January 2023, System Energy paid the refunds of $103.5 million, which included refunds of $41.7 million to Entergy Arkansas, $27.8 million to Entergy Louisiana, and $34 million to Entergy New Orleans. Based on the December 2022 FERC order and analysis of the remaining litigation, management determined that System Energy&#8217;s regulatory liability related to complaints against System Energy as of December 31, 2022 is adequate. \n\nIn February 2023 the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed protests to System Energy&#8217;s January 2023 compliance report, in which they challenged System Energy&#8217;s calculation of the refunds associated with the decommissioning tax position but did not protest the other components of the compliance report. Each of them argued that System Energy should have paid additional refunds for the decommissioning tax position issue, and the City Council estimated the total additional refunds owed to customers of Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Arkansas for that issue as $493 million, including interest (and without factoring in the $25.2 million refund that System Energy already paid in 2021). The FERC will review System Energy&#8217;s compliance refund report and the retail regulators&#8217; protests and issue a further order; there is no deadline for this order. If the FERC were to order additional refunds at a level consistent with the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council position on the remedy for the formerly uncertain tax positions, System Energy&#8217;s continued financial viability would be jeopardized. \n\nIn Januar y 2023, System Energy also filed a request for rehearing of the FERC&#8217;s determinations in the December 2022 order on sale-leaseback refund issues and future lease cost disallowances, the FERC&#8217;s prospective policy on uncertain tax positions, and the proper accounting of System Energy&#8217;s accumulated deferred income taxes adjustment for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and a motion for confirmation of its interpretation of the December 2022 order&#8217;s remedy concerning the decommissioning tax position. In January 2023 the retail regulators filed a motion for confirmation of their interpretation of the refund requirement in the December 2022 FERC order and a provisional request for rehearing. In February 2023 the FERC issued a notice that the rehearing requests have been deemed denied by operation of law. The deemed denial of the rehearing request initiates the sixty-day period in which aggrieved parties may petition for federal appellate court review of the underlying FERC orders; however the FERC may issue a substantive order on rehearing as long as it continues to have jurisdiction over the case. \n\nAs a result of the FERC order&#8217;s directives regarding the recovery of the sale-leaseback transaction, in December 2022 System Energy reduced the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback regulatory liability by $56 million, reduced the related accumulated deferred income tax asset by $94 million, and reduced the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback accumulated deferred income tax regulatory liability by $25 million, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $13 million. In addition, the FERC determined that System Energy recognized excess depreciation expense related to property subject to the sale-leaseback property. As a result, in December 2022, System Energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense and the related accumulated depreciation of $33 million. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nLPSC Additional Complaints \n\nIn May 2020 the LPSC authorized its staff to file additional complaints at the FERC related to the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf energy and capacity supplied to Entergy Louisiana under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The LPSC directive noted that the initial decision issued by the presiding ALJ in the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback complaint proceeding did not address, for procedural reasons, certain rate issues raised by the LPSC and declined to order further investigation of rates charged by System Energy. The LPSC directive authorized its staff to file complaints at the FERC &#8220;necessary to address these rate issues, to request a full investigation into the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf power, and to seek rate refund, rate reduction, and such other remedies as may be necessary and appropriate to protect Louisiana ratepayers.&#8221; The LPSC directive further stated that the LPSC has seen &#8220;information suggesting that the Grand Gulf plant has been significantly underperforming compared to other nuclear plants in the United States, has had several extended and unexplained outages, and has been plagued with serious safety concerns.&#8221; The LPSC expressed concern that the costs paid by Entergy Louisiana's retail customers may have been detrimentally impacted, and authorized &#8220;the filing of a FERC complaint to address these performance issues and to seek appropriate refund, rate reduction, and other remedies as may be appropriate.&#8221; \n\nUnit Power Sales Agreement Complaint \n\nThe first of the additional complaints was filed by the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, and the City Council in September 2020. The complaint raises two sets of rate allegations: violations of the filed rate and a corresponding request for refunds for prior periods; and elements of the Unit Power Sales Agreement are unjust and unreasonable and a corresponding request for refunds for the 15-month refund period and changes to the Unit Power Sales Agreement prospectively. Several of the filed rate allegations overlap with the previous complaints. The filed rate allegations not previously raised are that System Energy: failed to provide a rate base credit to customers for the &#8220;time value&#8221; of sale-leaseback lease payments collected from customers in advance of the time those payments were due to the owner-lessors; improperly included certain lease refinancing costs in rate base as prepayments; improperly included nuclear decommissioning outage costs in rate base; failed to include categories of accumulated deferred income taxes as a reduction to rate base; charged customers based on a higher equity ratio than would be appropriate due to excessive retained earnings; and did not correctly reflect money pool investments and imprudently invested cash into the money pool. The elements of the Unit Power Sales Agreement that the complaint alleges are unjust and unreasonable include: incentive and executive compensation, lack of an equity re-opener, lobbying, and private airplane travel. The complaint also requests a rate investigation into the Unit Power Sales Agreement and System Energy&#8217;s billing practices pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Power Act, including any issue relevant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its inputs. System Energy filed its answer opposing the complaint in November 2020. In its answer, System Energy argued that all of the claims raised in the complaint should be dismissed and agreed that bill adjustment with respect to two discrete issues were justified. System Energy argued that dismissal is warranted because all claims fall into one or more of the following categories: the claims have been raised and are being litigated in another proceeding; the claims do not present a prima facie case and do not satisfy the threshold burden to establish a complaint proceeding; the claims are premised on a theory or request relief that is incompatible with federal law or FERC policy; the claims request relief that is inconsistent with the filed rate; the claims are barred or waived by the legal doctrine of laches; and/or the claims have been fully addressed and do not warrant further litigation. In December 2020, System Energy filed a bill adjustment report indicating that $3.4 million had been credited to customers in connection with the two discrete issues concerning the inclusion of certain accumulated deferred income taxes balances in rates. In January 2021 the complainants filed a response to System Energy&#8217;s November 2020 answer, and in February 2021, System Energy filed a response to the complainant&#8217;s response. \n\nIn May 2021 the FERC issued an order addressing the complaint, establishing a refund effective date of September 21, 2020, establishing hearing procedures, and holding those procedures in abeyance pending FERC&#8217;s review of the initial decision in the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback renewal complaint discussed above. System Energy agreed that the hearing should be held in abeyance but sought rehearing of FERC&#8217;s decision as related to matters set \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nfor hearing that were beyond the scope of FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction or authority. The complainants sought rehearing of FERC&#8217;s decision to hold the hearing in abeyance and filed a motion to proceed, which motion System Energy subsequently opposed. In June 2021, System Energy&#8217;s request for rehearing was denied by operation of law, and System Energy filed an appeal of FERC&#8217;s orders in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The appeal was initially stayed for a period of 90 days, but the stay expired. In November 2021 the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal as premature. \n\nIn August 2021 the FERC issued an order addressing System Energy&#8217;s and the complainants&#8217; rehearing requests. The FERC dismissed part of the complaint seeking an equity re-opener, maintained the abeyance for issues related to the proceeding addressing the sale-leaseback renewal and uncertain tax positions, lifted the abeyance for issues unrelated to that proceeding, and clarified the scope of the hearing. \n\nIn November 2021 the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed direct testimony and requested the FERC to order refunds for prior periods and prospective amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The LPSC&#8217;s refund claims include, among other things, allegations that: (1) System Energy should not have included certain sale-leaseback transaction costs in prepayments; (2) System Energy should have credited rate base to reflect the time value of money associated with the advance collection of lease payments; (3) System Energy incorrectly included refueling outage costs that were recorded in account 174 in rate base; and (4) System Energy should have excluded several accumulated deferred income tax balances in account 190 from rate base. The LPSC is also seeking a retroactive adjustment to retained earnings and capital structure in conjunction with the implementation of its proposed refunds. In addition, the LPSC seeks amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement going forward to address below-the-line costs, incentive compensation, the working capital allowance, litigation expenses, and the 2019 termination of the capital funds agreement. The APSC argues that: (1) System Energy should have included borrowings from the Entergy System money pool in its determination of short-term debt in its cost of capital; and (2) System Energy should credit customers with System Energy&#8217;s allocation of earnings on money pool investments. The City Council alleges that System Energy has maintained excess cash on hand in the money pool and that retention of excess cash was imprudent. Based on this allegation, the City Council&#8217;s witness recommends a refund of approximately $98.8 million for the period 2004-September 2021 or other alternative relief. The City Council further recommends that the FERC impose a hypothetical equity ratio such as 48.15% equity to capital on a prospective basis. \n\nIn January 2022, System Energy filed answering testimony arguing that the FERC should not order refunds for prior periods or any prospective amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In response to the LPSC&#8217;s refund claims, System Energy argues, among other things, that: (1) the inclusion of sale-leaseback transaction costs in prepayments was correct; (2) that the filed rate doctrine bars the request for a retroactive credit to rate base for the time value of money associated with the advance collection of lease payments; (3) that an accounting misclassification for deferred refueling outage costs has been corrected, caused no harm to customers, and requires no refunds; and (4) that its accounting and ratemaking treatment of specified accumulated deferred income tax balances in account 190 has been correct. System Energy further responds that no retroactive adjustment to retained earnings or capital structure should be ordered because there is no general policy requiring such a remedy, and there was no showing that the retained earnings element of the capital structure was incorrectly implemented. Further, System Energy presented evidence that all of the costs that are being challenged were long known to the retail regulators and were approved by them for inclusion in retail rates, and the attempt to retroactively challenge these costs, some of which have been included in rates for decades, is unjust and unreasonable. In response to the LPSC&#8217;s proposed going-forward adjustments, System Energy presents evidence to show that none of the proposed adjustments are needed. On the issue of below-the-line expenses, during discovery procedures System Energy identified a historical allocation error in certain months and agreed to provide a bill credit to customers to correct the error. In response to the APSC&#8217;s claims, System Energy argues that the Unit Power Sales Agreement does not include System Energy&#8217;s borrowings from the Entergy System money pool or earnings on deposits to the Entergy System money pool in the determination of the cost of capital; and accordingly, no refunds are appropriate on those issues. In response to the City Council&#8217;s claims, System Energy argues that it has reasonably managed its cash and that the City Council&#8217;s theory of cash management is defective because it fails to adequately consider the relevant \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\ncash needs of System Energy and it makes faulty presumptions about the operation of the Entergy System money pool. System Energy further points out that the issue of its capital structure is already subject to pending FERC litigation. \n\nIn March 2022 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony in response to the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council&#8217;s direct testimony. In its testimony, the FERC trial staff recommends refunds for two primary reasons: (1) it concluded that System Energy should have excluded specified accumulated deferred income tax balances in account 190 associated with rate refunds; and (2) it concluded that System Energy should have excluded specified accumulated deferred income tax balances in account 190 associated with a deemed contract satisfaction and reissuance that occurred in 2005. The FERC trial staff recommends refunds of $84.1 million, exclusive of any tax gross-up or FERC interest. In addition, the FERC trial staff recommends the following prospective modifications to the Unit Power Sales Agreement: (1) inclusion of a rate base credit to recognize the time value of money associated with the advance collection of lease payments; (2) exclusion of executive incentive compensation costs for members of the Office of the Chief Executive and long-term performance unit costs where awards are based solely or primarily on financial metrics; and (3) exclusion of unvested, accrued amounts for stock options, performance units, and restricted stock awards. With respect to issues that ultimately concern the reasonableness of System Energy&#8217;s rate of return, the FERC trial staff states that it is unnecessary to consider such issues in this proceeding, in light of the pending case concerning System Energy&#8217;s return on equity and capital structure. On all other material issues raised by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council, the FERC trial staff recommends either no refunds or no modification to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. \n\nIn April 2022, System Energy filed cross-answering testimony in response to the FERC trial staff&#8217;s recommendations of refunds for the accumulated deferred income taxes issues and proposed modifications to the Unit Power Sales Agreement for the executive incentive compensation issues. In June 2022 the FERC trial staff submitted revised answering testimony, in which it recommended additional refunds associated with the accumulated deferred income tax balances in account 190 associated with a deemed contract satisfaction and reissuance that occurred in 2005. Based on the testimony revisions, the FERC trial staff&#8217;s recommended refunds total $106.6 million, exclusive of any tax gross-up or FERC awarded interest. Also in June 2022, System Energy filed revised and supplemental cross -answering testimony to respond to the changes in the FERC trial staff&#8217;s testimony and oppose its revised recommendation. \n\nIn May 2022 the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed rebuttal testimony. The LPSC&#8217;s testimony asserts new claims, including that: (1) certain of the sale-leaseback transaction costs may have been imprudently incurred; (2) accumulated deferred income taxes associated with sale-leaseback transaction costs should have been included in rate base; (3) accumulated deferred income taxes associated with federal investment tax credits should have been excluded from rate base; (4) monthly net operating loss accumulated deferred income taxes should have been excluded from rate base; and (5) several categories of proposed rate changes, including executive incentive compensation, air travel, industry dues, and legal costs, also warrant historical refunds. The LPSC&#8217;s rebuttal testimony argues that refunds for the alleged tariff violations and other claims must be calculated by rerunning the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate; however, it includes estimates of refunds associated with some, but not all, of its claims, totaling $286 million without interest. The City Council&#8217;s rebuttal testimony also proposes a new, alternate theory and claim for relief regarding System Energy&#8217;s participation in the Entergy System money pool, under which it calculates estimated refunds of approximately $51.7 million. The APSC&#8217;s rebuttal testimony agrees with the LPSC&#8217;s direct testimony that retained earnings should be adjusted in a comprehensive refund calculation. The testimony quantifies the estimated impacts of three issues: (1) a $1.5 million reduction in the revenue requirement under the Unit Power Sales Agreement if System Energy&#8217;s borrowings from the money pool are included in short-term debt; (2) a $1.9 million reduction in the revenue requirement if System Energy&#8217;s allocated share of money pool earnings are credited through the Unit Power Sales Agreement; and (3) a $1.9 million reduction in the revenue requirement for every $50 million of refunds ordered in a given year, without interest. In total, excluding the settled issues noted below, the claims seek more than $700 million in refunds and interest, based on charges to all Unit Power Sales Agreement purchasers including Entergy Mississippi. \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nIn June 2022 a new procedural schedule was adopted, providing for additional rounds of testimony and for the hearing to begin in September 2022. The hearing concluded in December 2022. Also in December 2022, a motion to extend the briefing schedule and the deadline for the initial decision was granted. The initial decision is due in May 2023. \n\nIn November 2022, System Energy filed a partial settlement agreement with the APSC, the City Council , and the LPSC that resolves the following issues raised in the Unit Power Sales Agreement complaint: advance collection of lease payments, aircraft costs, executive incentive compensation, money pool borrowings, advertising expenses, deferred nuclear refueling outage costs, industry association dues, and termination of the capital funds agreement. The settlement provides that System Energy will provide a black-box refund of $18 million (inclusive of interest), plus additional refund amounts with interest to be calculated for certain issues to be distributed to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans as the Utility operating companies other than Entergy Mississippi purchasing under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement further provides that if the APSC, the City Council , or the LPSC agrees to the global settlement System Energy entered into with the MPSC (discussed below), and such global settlement includes a black-box refund amount, then the black-box refund for this settlement agreement shall not be incremental or in addition to the global black-box refund amount. The settlement agreement addresses other matters as well, including adjustments to rate base beginning in October 2022, exclusion of certain other costs, and inclusion of money pool borrowings, if any, in short-term debt within the cost of capital calculation used in the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The settlement agreement is pending FERC approval. \n\nLPSC Petition for Writ of Mandamus \n\nIn August 2022 the LPSC filed a petition for a writ of mandamus asking the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to order the FERC to act within ninety days on certain pending proceedings, including the Grand Gulf prudence complaint, the return on equity and capital structure complaints, and the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback renewal complaint. In September 2022 the FERC and System Energy filed oppositions to the LPSC&#8217;s petition, and the APSC and the City Council filed interventions in support of the petition. In December 2022 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral argument on the petition. In January 2023, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order directing the FERC to explain the length of time it takes for final action on complaints filed under section 206 of the Federal Power Act, including the complaint proceedings raised by the LPSC&#8217;s petition. In February 2023 the FERC responded, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order denying the petition. \n\nGrand Gulf Prudence Complaint \n\nThe second of the additional complaints was filed at the FERC in March 2021 by the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council against System Energy, Entergy Services, Entergy Operations, and Entergy Corporation. The second complaint contains two primary allegations. First, it alleges that, based on the plant&#8217;s capacity factor and alleged safety performance, System Energy and the other respondents imprudently operated Grand Gulf during the period 2016-2020, and it seeks refunds of at least $360 million in alleged replacement energy costs, in addition to other costs, including those that can only be identified upon further investigation. Second, it alleges that the performance and/or management of the 2012 extended power uprate of Grand Gulf was imprudent, and it seeks refunds of all costs of the 2012 uprate that are determined to result from imprudent planning or management of the project. In addition to the requested refunds, the complaint asks that the FERC modify the Unit Power Sales Agreement to provide for full cost recovery only if certain performance indicators are met and to require pre-authorization of capital improvement projects in excess of $125 million before related costs may be passed through to customers in rates. In April 2021, System Energy and the other respondents filed their motion to dismiss and answer to the complaint. System Energy requested that the FERC dismiss the claims within the complaint. With respect to the claim concerning operations, System Energy argues that the complaint does not meet its legal burden because, among other reasons, it fails to allege any specific imprudent conduct. With respect to the claim concerning the uprate, System Energy argues that the complaint fails because, among other reasons, the complainants&#8217; own conduct prevents them from raising a serious doubt as to the prudence of the uprate. System \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nEnergy also requests that the FERC dismiss other elements of the complaint, including the proposed modifications to the Unit Power Sales Agreement, because they are not warranted. Additional responsive pleadings were filed by the complainants and System Energy during the period from March through July 2021. In November 2022 the FERC issued an order setting the complaint for settlement and hearing procedures. In February 2023 the FERC issued an order denying rehearing and thereby affirming its order setting the complaint for settlement and hearing procedures. Settlement procedures are ongoing. \n\nSystem Energy Formula Rate Annual Protocols Formal Challenge Concerning 2020 Calendar Year Bills \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s Unit Power Sales Agreement includes formula rate protocols that provide for the disclosure of cost inputs, an opportunity for informal discovery procedures, and a challenge process. In February 2022, pursuant to the protocols procedures, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed with the FERC a formal challenge to System Energy&#8217;s implementation of the formula rate during calendar year 2020. The formal challenge alleges: (1) that it was imprudent for System Energy to accept the IRS&#8217;s partial acceptance of a previously uncertain tax position; (2) that System Energy should have delayed recording the result of the IRS&#8217;s partial acceptance of the previously uncertain tax position until after internal tax allocation payments were made; (3) that the equity ratio charged in rates was excessive; (4) that sale-leaseback rental payments should have been excluded from rates; and (5) that all issues in the ongoing Unit Power Sales Agreement complaint proceeding should also be reflected in calendar year 2020 bills. While System Energy disagrees that any refunds are owed for the 2020 calendar year bills, the formal challenge estimates that the financial impact of the first through fourth allegations is approximately $53 million; it does not provide an estimate of the financial impact of the fifth allegation. However, $17 million of the $53 million is attributable to the sale-leaseback rental payments. These were refunded to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans in January 2023 as a result of the FERC order received in the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback renewal complaint and uncertain tax position rate base issue. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s portion of the refund was included within the settlement with the MPSC, as discussed below. \n\nIn March 2022, System Energy filed an answer to the formal challenge in which it requested that the FERC deny the formal challenge as a matter of law, or else hold the proceeding in abeyance pending the resolution of related dockets. \n\nSystem Energy Settlement with the MPSC \n\nIn June 2022, System Energy, Entergy Mississippi, and additional named Entergy parties involved in thirteen docketed proceedings before the FERC filed with the FERC a partial settlement agreement and offer of settlement. The settlement memorializes the Entergy parties&#8217; agreement with the MPSC to globally resolve all actual and potential claims between the Entergy parties and the MPSC associated with those FERC proceedings and with System Energy&#8217;s past implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is a FERC-jurisdictional formula rate tariff for sales of energy and capacity from System Energy&#8217;s owned and leased share of Grand Gulf to Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans. Entergy Mississippi purchases the greatest single amount, nearly 40% of System Energy&#8217;s share of Grand Gulf, after its additional purchases from affiliates are considered. The settlement therefore limits System Energy&#8217;s overall refund exposure associated with the identified proceedings because they will be resolved completely as between the Entergy parties and the MPSC. \n\nThe FERC proceedings that are resolved as between the Entergy parties and the MPSC include the return on equity and capital structure complaints, the Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback renewal complaint and uncertain tax position rate base issue, the Unit Power Sales Agreement complaint, and the Grand Gulf prudence complaint, all of which are discussed above. They also include the proceedings concerning System Energy&#8217;s return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the proceedings established to address System Energy&#8217;s October 2020 and December 2020 Federal Power Act section 205 filings to provide credits to customers related to the IRS&#8217;s decision as to the uncertain decommissioning tax position, also as discussed. The settlement also resolves \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nthe MPSC&#8217;s involvement in the formal challenge filed by the retail regulators of System Energy&#8217;s customers in connection with the implementation of the Unit Power Sales Agreement annual formula rate protocols for the 2020 test year, which is discussed above. \n\nThe settlement provides for a black-box refund of $235 million from System Energy to Entergy Mississippi, which was to be paid within 120 days of the settlement&#8217;s effective date (either the date of the FERC approval of the settlement without material modification, or the date that all settling parties agree to accept modifications or otherwise modify the settlement in response to a proposed material modification by the FERC). In addition, beginning with the July 2022 service month, the settlement provides for Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s bills from System Energy to be adjusted to reflect: an authorized rate of return on equity of 9.65%, a capital structure not to exceed 52% equity, a rate base reduction for the advance collection of sale-leaseback rental costs, and the exclusion of certain long-term incentive plan performance unit costs from rates. \n\nThe settlement was expressly contingent upon the approval of the FERC and the MPSC. It was approved by the MPSC in June 2022 and the FERC in November 2022. The remaining retail regulators of Entergy&#8217;s utility operating company purchasers under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (the APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council) were offered an option to elect to join the settlement, but none of them has elected to do so yet. \n\nSystem Energy previously recorded a provision and associated liability of $37 million for elements of the applicable litigation. In June 2022, System Energy recorded a regulatory charge of $551 million ($413 million net-of-tax), increasing the regulatory liability to $588 million, which consisted of $235 million for the settlement with the MPSC and $353 million for potential future refunds to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy paid the black-box refund of $235 million to Entergy Mississippi in November 2022. In addition, as discussed above in &#8220; Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate Base Issue, &#8221; $103.5 million of the total remaining regulatory liability of $353 million was reclassified to a current regulatory liability as of December 31, 2022 to reflect the refunds being paid to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans in January 2023 as a result of the FERC&#8217;s order in December 2022 on those issues. \n\nUnit Power Sales Agreement \n\nIn December 2021, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to adopt updated rates for use in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses. The proposed amendments would result in higher charges to the Utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. In February 2022 the FERC accepted System Entergy&#8217;s proposed increased depreciation rates with an effective date of March 1, 2022, subject to refund pending the outcome of the settlement and/or hearing procedures. Settlement procedures are ongoing. \n\nNuclear Matters \n\nSystem Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates Grand Gulf. System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position Grand Gulf to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of Grand Gulf, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues related to equipment reliability; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of the site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nrequired to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. Grand Gulf&#8217;s operating license expires in 2044. \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of System Energy&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of System Energy&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. \n\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs \n\nSee &#8220; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. \n\nUtility Regulatory Accounting \n\nSee &#8220; Utility Regulatory Accounting &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. \n\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n\nSee &#8220; Impairment of Long-lived Assets &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions \n\nSee &#8220; Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. \n\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits \n\nSystem Energy&#8217;s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See &#8220; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis \n\nthe complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy&#8217;s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. \n\nCost Sensitivity \n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on 2022 Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $236 $6,882 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $498 $&#8212; Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $194 $1,248 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on 2022 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation &#160; &#160; Increase/(Decrease) &#160; Discount rate (0.25%) $55 $954 Health care cost trend 0.25% $146 $845 ##TABLE_END\n\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. \n\nCosts and Employer Contributions \n\nTotal qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2022 was $21.7 million, including $9.9 million in settlement costs. System Energy anticipates 2023 qualified pension cost to be $8.1 million. System Energy contributed $28.6 million to its qualified pension plans in 2022 and estimates 2023 pension contributions will approximate $15.5 million, although the 2023 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2023 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2023. \n\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for System Energy in 2022 was $1 million. System Energy expects 2023 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $348 thousand. System Energy contributed $944 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2022 and expects 2023 contributions to approximate $26 thousand. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nSee &#8220; Other Contingencies &#8221; in the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee &#8220; New Accounting Pronouncements &#8221; section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholder and Board of Directors of \n\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of System Energy Resources, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in common equity (pages 470 through 474 and applicable items in pages 53 through 245), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that is material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nRate and Regulatory Matters &#8212;System Energy Resources, Inc. &#8212; Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is subject to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the FERC sets the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable \n\nreturn on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. \n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the (1) likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) likelihood of refunds to customers, and (3) ongoing complaints filed with the FERC against the Company. Auditing management&#8217;s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the FERC, involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and significant auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management&#8217;s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the Company&#8217;s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments. \n\n&#8226; We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC for the Company, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the FERC&#8217;s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.

According to the plans, these shares can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open market. Entergy&#8217;s management has been authorized by the Board to repurchase on the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of grants under the plans. In addition to this authority, the Board has authorized share repurchase programs to enable opportunistic purchases in response to market conditions. In October 2010 the Board granted authority for a $500 million share repurchase program. The amount of share repurchases under these programs may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities. In addition, in the first quarter 2022, Entergy withheld 79,738 shares of its common stock at $110.35 per share, 77,207 shares of its common stock at $111.16 per share, 35,940 shares of its common stock at $111.77 per share, 1,219 shares of its common stock at $109.01 per share, 577 shares of its common stock at $106.62 per share, 232 shares of its common stock at $110.77 per share, 87 shares of its common stock at $109.01 per share, and 82 shares of its common stock at $111.47 per share to pay income taxes due upon vesting of restricted stock granted and payout of performance units as part of its long-term incentive program. \n\n(1) See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the stock-based compensation plans. \n\n(2) Maximum amount of shares that may yet be repurchased relates only to the $500 million plan and does not include an estimate of the amount of shares that may be purchased to fund the exercise of grants under the stock-based compensation plans. \n\nEntergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy \n\nThere is no market for the common equity of the Registrant Subsidiaries. \n\n"

Controls and Procedures \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, evaluations were performed under the supervision and with the participation of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy (each individually a &#8220;Registrant&#8221; and collectively the &#8220;Registrants&#8221;) management, including their respective Principal Executive Officers (PEO) and Principal Financial Officers (PFO). The evaluations assessed the effectiveness of the Registrants&#8217; disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluations, each PEO and PFO has concluded that, as to the Registrant or Registrants for which they serve as PEO or PFO, the Registrant&#8217;s or Registrants&#8217; disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by each Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and that the Registrant&#8217;s or Registrants&#8217; disclosure controls and procedures are also effective in reasonably assuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant&#8217;s or Registrants&#8217; management, including their respective PEOs and PFOs, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) \n\nThe managements of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy (each individually a &#8220;Registrant&#8221; and collectively the &#8220;Registrants&#8221;) are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Registrants. Each Registrant&#8217;s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of each Registrant&#8217;s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. \n\nEach Registrant&#8217;s management assessed the effectiveness of each Registrant&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, each Registrant&#8217;s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. The 2013 COSO Framework was utilized for management&#8217;s assessment. \n\nBased on each management&#8217;s assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013 COSO Framework, each Registrant&#8217;s management believes that each Registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe report of Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, Entergy Corporation&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding Entergy Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is included herein. The report of Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP is not applicable to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy because these Registrants are non-accelerated filers. \n\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of each Registrant&#8217;s management, including its respective PEO and PFO, each Registrant evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and found no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. \n\nAttestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and Board of Directors of \n\nEntergy Corporation and Subsidiaries \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 of the Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \n\nFebruary 24, 2023 \n\n"

No additional compensation was paid in 2022 to any of these officers for their service as NEOs of the Utility operating companies. \n\n(2) On November 1, 2022, Mr. Marsh became Entergy Corporation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer following Mr. Denault&#8217;s resignation as the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. Also on November 1, 2022, Mr. Denault was elected Executive Chair and in such role continued serving as Chairman of the Board. Effective January 31, 2023, Mr. Denault resigned from the position of Executive Chair and from the Board and Mr. Marsh was elected Chairman of the Board. \n\n(3) Ms. Fontan, who previously served as Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, succeeded Mr. Marsh as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on November 1, 2022. \n\nAll of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s, Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s, Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s, Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s, and Entergy Texas&#8217;s directors are employees of Entergy or its subsidiaries and do not receive any additional compensation for their services as director. \n\nEntergy Corporation&#8217;s Compensation Principles and Philosophy \n\nEntergy Corporation&#8217;s executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay for performance aimed at achieving the Company&#8217;s strategy and business objectives. Entergy Corporation believes its executive pay programs advance the interests of all of its stakeholders, as they are thoughtfully designed to: \n\n&#8226; Motivate and reward the achievement of results that are deemed by the Talent and Compensation Committee to be consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the Board has approved for the Company. \n\n&#8226; Attract and retain a highly experienced, diverse, and successful management team. \n\n&#8226; Create sustainable value for the benefit of all of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s stakeholders, including its customers, employees, communities, and owners. \n\n&#8226; Align the interests of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s executives with the Company&#8217;s long-term business strategy by tying equity-based awards to performance metrics designed to focus Entergy Corporation&#8217;s executives on driving continuous improvement in operational and financial results to the benefit of all stakeholders, including Entergy Corporation&#8217;s customers, employees, communities, and owners. \n\nCompensation Best Practices \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee reviews Entergy&#8217;s executive compensation programs on an ongoing basis to evaluate whether they support the Company&#8217;s executive compensation principles and philosophy and are aligned with the interests of our stakeholders. The Company&#8217;s executive compensation practices include the following, each of which the Talent and Compensation Committee believes reinforces our executive compensation principles and philosophy: \n\n##TABLE_START Practice Description Pay for Performance The executive compensation programs yield pay outcomes that the Company believes are highly correlated with performance and drive long-term value creation. \n\nAnnual and Long-Term Incentive Measures Drive Desired Employee Behaviors \n\nPerformance measures for the annual and long-term incentive programs are designed to incentivize employee behaviors that serve the Company&#8217;s key stakeholders: &#8226; \n\nCustomers &#8211; Net Promoter Score (NPS). \n\n&#8226; \n\nEmployees &#8211; Diversity, Inclusion, &#38; Belonging (DIB) and Safety. \n\n&#8226; \n\nCommunities &#8211; Environmental Stewardship, DIB. \n\n&#8226; \n\nOwners &#8211; Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Credit, TSR. \n\nDouble Trigger Change-in-Control The Company requires both a change-in-control and an involuntary termination without cause or voluntary termination with good reason for cash severance payments and immediate vesting of unvested equity awards. Long-Term Incentives Paid in Stock All long-term incentives are settled in shares of Entergy common stock. Stock Ownership Guidelines The Company requires executive officers to own a significant amount of Entergy stock. Cap on Incentive Awards for OCE Members The maximum payout for members of the OCE is capped at 200% of the target opportunity for the annual incentive and long-term Performance Unit Program (PUP) awards. \n\nRigorous Goals The Company sets financial goals based on externally disclosed annual and multi-year guidance and outlooks and non-financial goals based on rigorous internal review. ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Practice Description Clawback Policy If the Company is required to restate its financial statements due to noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws or if there is a material miscalculation of a performance measure related to incentive compensation, regardless of whether the financials are restated, the Company&#8217;s clawback policy requires the Company to recover from current and former executive officers incentive compensation overpayments made during the three years preceding such restatement or material miscalculation, as applicable. \n\nIf the Board determines that a current or former executive officer engaged in fraud resulting in a restatement of the Company&#8217;s financial statements or a material miscalculation of an incentive compensation performance measure, the Company may seek to recover all or part of the incentive compensation affected by the fraudulent act and paid or payable to such executive officer during the three years preceding the restatement or the material miscalculation, as applicable. \n\nNo Hedging of Company Stock Directors, executive officers, and employees of Entergy and its subsidiaries may not directly or indirectly engage in transactions intended to hedge or offset the market value of the Company&#8217;s common stock owned by them. \n\nNo Pledging of Company Stock Directors and executive officers of Entergy and its subsidiaries may not directly or indirectly pledge Entergy common stock as collateral for any obligation. No Excessive Perquisites Executive officers receive limited ongoing perquisites that make up a small portion of total compensation. No Tax Gross-Ups The Company does not provide tax gross ups to OCE members, other than relocation benefits. No Dividends on Unearned Performance Awards The Company does not pay dividends on unearned performance awards. \n\nNo Repricing or Exchange of Underwater Stock Options The Company&#8217;s equity incentive plan does not permit repricing or the exchange of underwater stock options without the approval of its shareholders. No Employment Agreements The Company does not have employment contracts with its executive officers. \n\nIndependent Compensation Consultant The Talent and Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant to advise on the executive compensation programs and practices. \n\nAnnual Say-on-Pay The Company values the input of its shareholders on the executive compensation programs. Entergy&#8217;s Board seeks an annual non-binding advisory vote from shareholders to approve the executive compensation disclosed in the CD&#38;A, tabular disclosure, and related narrative of the Company&#8217;s annual proxy statements. Annual Compensation Risk Assessment A risk assessment of the compensation programs is performed on an annual basis to ensure that the programs and policies do not incentivize unnecessary or excessive risk-taking behavior. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Incentive Payouts \n\nPerformance measures and targets for the 2022 annual incentive awards were determined by the Talent and Compensation Committee in December 2021 and January 2022, respectively. Performance measures and targets for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 performance period for the long-term PUP awards were established in December 2019 and January 2020, respectively. In January 2023 the Talent and Compensation Committee certified the results for the Entergy Achievement Multiplier (&#8220;EAM&#8221;), the formulaic payout factor that determines the funding available for the 2022 \n\nannual incentive awards, and certified the results for the long-term PUP awards for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 long-term performance period. \n\nAnnual Incentive Awards \n\nIn December 2021 the Talent and Compensation Committee determined that the EAM that would determine the overall funding level for the 2022 annual incentive awards would be based on financial and non-financial measures with the financial measure weighted 60% and the non-financial measures, which address key aspects of our performance on strategies designed to ensure the long-term health and success of the Company, collectively accounting for the remaining 40%. \n\nFinancial Measure : Keeping with the Talent and Compensation Committee&#8217;s goal of aligning performance measures with financial results that link to externally communicated investor guidance, Entergy Tax Adjusted Earnings Per Share (&#8220;ETR Tax Adjusted EPS&#8221;) was used as the financial measure to determine the EAM. \n\nNon-Financial Measures : To demonstrate Entergy&#8217;s strong commitment to creating long-term sustainable value for its key stakeholders - customers, communities, employees, and owners - and to link executive compensation more directly to the achievement of those objectives, the Talent and Compensation Committee decided that 40% of the EAM would be determined on the basis of progress achieved in the following areas, each of which would be weighted equally: Safety; Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging; Environmental Stewardship; and the Customer Net Promoter Score, or NPS. \n\nThe 2022 annual incentive targets and results determined by the Talent and Compensation Committee were: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nAnnual Incentive Performance Goals (1) \n\n2022 Percentage of EAM Target 2022 Results Level of Achievement ETR Tax Adjusted EPS ($) 60% 6.30 6.58 195% \n\nSafety (SIF Rate) (2) \n\n10% 0.03 0.06 44% Customer NPS 10% 12.00 5.60 31% Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging 10% Qualitative (3) \n\n90% Environmental Stewardship 10% Qualitative (3) \n\n119% EAM as a percentage of target 100% 145% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) &#8220;What Entergy Corporation Pays and Why &#8211; 2022 Compensation Decisions &#8211; Annual Incentive Compensation &#8211; 2022 Performance Assessment&#8221; for the minimum and maximum achievement levels. \n\n(2) SIF Rate refers to rate of serious injuries and fatalities per 100 employees or contractors. The employee and contractor targets and results are averaged to arrive at reported results. The 2022 target was top quartile performance among electric utilities for 2022, as reported by the Edison Electric Institute. \n\n(3) This qualitative assessment is informed by quantitative measures. See &#8220;What Entergy Corporation Pays and Why &#8211; 2022 Compensation Decisions &#8211; ESG Measures and Targets&#8221; for a discussion of the performance assessment of the Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging and Environmental Stewardship performance measures. \n\nAfter consideration of individual performance, the Talent and Compensation Committee awarded the NEOs payouts averaging 130% of target, with a payout of 130% of target to Mr. Denault. \n\nLong-Term Performance Unit Program \n\nIn January 2020 the Talent and Compensation Committee chose relative TSR and Cumulative ETR Adjusted Earnings Per Share (&#8220;Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS&#8221;) as the performance measures for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 \n\nperformance period, with relative TSR weighted 80% and ETR Adjusted EPS weighted 20%. Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS adjusts Entergy&#8217;s as reported (GAAP) results to eliminate the impact of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business and other non-routine items, consistent with the manner in which we communicated earnings guidance and outlooks to investors at the time the measure was chosen. \n\nThe targets and results for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 performance period as determined by the Talent and Compensation Committee were: \n\n##TABLE_START Long-Term PUP Measures 2020-2022 PUP Target 2020-2022 PUP Results Relative TSR Median 4 th Quartile (2) \n\nCumulative ETR Adjusted EPS($) (1) \n\n17.85 18.46 Payout (as a percentage of target) 100% 27% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS measure was replaced in 2021 by Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio to avoid the use of duplicative measures in the annual incentive and long-term incentive programs. See &#8220;2022 Performance Measures and Methodology&#8221; below for additional discussion of the performance measures for the current long-term Performance Unit Program. \n\n(2) The Company ranked 16 th of the 20 companies comprising the Philadelphia Utility Index for the performance period. \n\nWhat Entergy Corporation Pays and Why \n\nHow Entergy Corporation Makes Compensation Decisions \n\nRole of the Talent and Compensation Committee \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, determines the compensation for each member of the OCE and oversees the design and administration of Entergy&#8217;s executive compensation programs. Each year, the Talent and Compensation Committee reviews and considers a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the executive compensation programs, including the elements of each OCE member&#8217;s compensation, with input from the committee&#8217;s independent compensation consultant. When establishing the compensation programs for the NEOs, the Talent and Compensation Committee also considers input and recommendations from management, including Entergy&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Entergy&#8217;s Chief Human Resource Officer, who attend the Talent and Compensation Committee meetings as appropriate. The committee annually conducts an independence assessment of its advisors including the compensation consultant, consistent with NYSE listing standards and SEC rules governing proxy disclosure. \n\nRole of the Independent Compensation Consultant \n\nIn 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee continued to retain Pay Governance, LLC (&#8220;Pay Governance&#8221;) as its independent compensation consultant. Pay Governance attended each of the 2022 Talent and Compensation Committee meetings and provided advice, including reviewing and commenting on market compensation data used to establish the compensation of the executive officers and Entergy Corporation&#8217;s directors, the terms and performance goals applicable to incentive plan awards, the process for certifying achievement of the incentive goals, and analysis with respect to specific projects and information regarding trends and competitive practices. The compensation consultant also meets with the Talent and Compensation Committee members without management present. \n\nCompetitive Positioning \n\n&#10146; Market Data for Compensation Comparison \n\nAnnually, the Talent and Compensation Committee reviews: \n\n&#8226; published and private compensation survey data analyzed and provided by Pay Governance; \n\n&#8226; both utility and general industry data to determine total direct compensation (base salary, annual, and long-term incentive) for non-industry specific roles; and \n\n&#8226; data from utility companies to determine total direct compensation for management roles that are utility-specific, such as Group President, Utility Operations. \n\n&#10146; How the Talent and Compensation Committee Uses Market Data \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total direct compensation within a targeted range of approximately the 50 th percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. In general, compensation levels for an executive officer who is new to a position tend to be closer to the 25 th percentile of surveyed companies, while seasoned executive officers whose experience and skill set are viewed as critical to retain may be positioned at or somewhat above the market median. \n\n&#10146; Proxy Peer Group \n\nAlthough the survey data described above is the primary data used in benchmarking compensation, the Talent and Compensation Committee used compensation information from the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the Company&#8217;s compensation programs and to determine relative TSR performance levels for the 2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP performance period. The Talent and Compensation Committee identified the Philadelphia Utility Index as the appropriate industry peer group for determining relative TSR performance levels because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, are viewed as comparable to the Company in terms of business and scale. \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee approved the 2022 compensation model and framework based on compensation information from the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index as of December 31, 2021, which were: \n\n##TABLE_START AES Corporation Consolidated Edison Inc.

Service-based with 3-year pro rata vesting ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compensation Decisions \n\nBase Salary \n\nThe salary for each NEO is based on the outcome of an annual merit review, the need to retain an experienced team, job promotion, individual performance, scope of responsibility, leadership skills and values, current compensation, and internal equity. For the NEOs who are members of the OCE, the Talent and Compensation Committee also considers the results of the annual market assessment of OCE compensation as \n\nprovided by its independent compensation consultant. The Talent and Compensation Committee considers changes in the base salaries of the NEOs at least annually, and i n 2022, all of the NEOs, other than Mr. Denault, received increases in their base salaries ranging from approximately 2.99% to 5.2% effective April 1, 2022. Mr. Denault did not receive a merit increase in April 2022 as the Talent and Compensation Committee believed that his base salary was generally consistent with market levels for comparably situated executives. In connection with their November 2022 promotions, Mr. Marsh&#8217;s base salary increased from $732,021 to $1,100,000 and Ms. Fontan&#8217;s base salary increased from $369,850 to $625,000. These adjustments were made after considering the competitive market data described above as well as their previous compensation levels and the compensation paid to their predecessors. \n\nThe following table sets forth the 2021 and 2022 year-end base salaries for the NEOs. Except as indicated above, changes in base salaries for 2022 were effective in April. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nNamed Executive Officer (1) \n\n2021 Base Salary 2022 Base Salary \n\nA.

West $753,819 $776,434 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The compensation levels for each of these officers were determined using competitive compensation data provided by Pay Governance. \n\nAnnual Incentive Compensation \n\nThe NEOs are eligible for annual incentive awards under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (&#8220;2019 OIP&#8221;). The maximum funding available for the annual incentive awards is determined by the EAM performance measure. At the beginning of each year, after a review of the Company&#8217;s strategic plan, the Talent and Compensation Committee engages in a rigorous process to determine the financial, strategic, and operational measures and the targets for each measure that will be used to determine the EAM. The Talent and Compensation Committee also annually establishes target opportunities for each NEO who is a member of the OCE. For the other NEOs, target award opportunities are determined based on their management level within the Entergy organization. Executive management levels at Entergy Corporation range from ML level 1 through ML level 4. Accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one another based on either their management level or the external market data developed by Pay Governance. At December 31, 2022, Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. May, Ms. Rodriguez, and Mr. Viamontes were promoted from ML level 4 to ML level 3 positions. In 2022, the target opportunities (as a percentage of base salary) for Ms. Fontan, Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, Ms. Rodriguez, and Mr. Viamontes were increased in conjunction with their promotions during the year as follows: from 40% to 55% for Mr. Fisackerly; from 60% to 75% for Ms. Fontan; from 40% to 55% for Ms. Landreaux; from 85% to 120% for Mr. Marsh; from 40% to 50% for Ms. Rodriguez; and from 40% to 55% for Mr. Viamontes. These adjustments were made after considering the competitive market data described above as well as their previous compensation levels. The target opportunities for the other NEOs in 2022 remained at the same level as those established for 2021. \n\nIn January, after the end of the fiscal year, the Finance and Talent and Compensation Committees jointly review the Company&#8217;s results, and the Talent and Compensation Committee determines the EAM based on the level of achievement of the performance measures established. The Talent and Compensation Committee retains \n\ndiscretion to modify the EAM based on its assessment of the degree of management&#8217;s success in achieving the Company&#8217;s strategic objectives and overcoming any challenges that occurred during the year. \n\nIndividual executive officer awards are determined based on the Talent and Compensation Committee&#8217;s or management&#8217;s consideration of each executive&#8217;s role in executing the Company&#8217;s strategies and delivering the financial and operational performance achieved, but also the individual&#8217;s accountability for any challenges and achievements the Company experienced during the year. \n\n2022 Performance Measures and Methodology \n\nFor 2022 and consistent with the 2021 program design, the Talent and Compensation Committee decided that the EAM would be based on both financial and non-financial measures, with the financial measure weighted 60% and four non-financial measures each weighted at 10%. Targets and ranges of performance were established for each of the measures, with no payout for results less than the designated minimum, a 25% payout opportunity for results at the minimum, a 100% payout opportunity for results at target, and a 200% payout opportunity for results equal to or exceeding the maximum. Payout opportunities for results between the minimum and maximum performance achievement levels were determined by straight line interpolation, with the EAM result being determined by the weighted average of the payout opportunities for each of the performance measures. \n\nFinancial Measure and Target \n\nFor the EAM financial measure, the Talent and Compensation Committee decided to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS. This measure is based on ETR Adjusted EPS, the earnings measure by which the Company provides external guidance, which is then adjusted to add back the net effect (positive or negative) of significant tax strategy items and to eliminate the effect of: (i) major storms, including the impact on total debt of pending securitizations, (ii) resolutions during the year of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, (iii) unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (iv) effects of federal income tax law changes, and (v) any adjustments to contributions to pension investments or trusts related to post-retirement benefits that are elective and deviate from original plan assumptions (collectively, the &#8220;Pre-Determined Exclusions&#8221;). The Talent and Compensation Committee determined that target performance for this metric would equal management&#8217;s expectation for ETR Adjusted EPS as reflected in its financial plan, or $6.30 per share, with minimum performance determined to be $6.00 per share and maximum performance being $6.60 per share. \n\nETR Tax Adjusted EPS was used as the financial measure for the EAM because: \n\n&#8226; It is based on an objective financial measure that the Company and its investors consider to be important in evaluating financial performance. \n\n&#8226; It is based on the same measure used for internal and external financial reporting. \n\n&#8226; It provides both discipline and transparency. \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee considered it appropriate to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, which adds back the net effect of significant tax strategy items that may have been excluded from ETR Adjusted EPS, as the earnings measure because of the significant financial benefits to the Company resulting from such tax strategy items and the management effort required to achieve them. \n\nThe committee also considered, both at the time it chose ETR Tax Adjusted EPS as the EAM financial measure and when it established the targets for this measure, the appropriateness of excluding the effect of each of the specific Pre-Determined Exclusions it had identified from the financial measure. It viewed the exclusion of major storms as appropriate because although the Company includes estimates for storm costs in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane, given management&#8217;s inability to control or predict acts of nature. The Talent and Compensation Committee considered the exclusion of the effects of any unanticipated changes in federal income tax law to be appropriate because of the inability of management to impact those results. It approved the exclusion of elective adjustments to Company contributions to pension and post- \n\nretirement benefit plan trusts because such elective adjustments are not reflective of the underlying performance of the business. The Talent and Compensation Committee approved the other Pre-Determined Exclusions from reported results &#8212; for the impact of certain legacy unresolved regulatory litigation and unanticipated unrealized gains and losses on securities &#8212; primarily because of management&#8217;s inability to influence either of the related outcomes. \n\nESG Measures and Targets \n\nTo demonstrate Entergy&#8217;s strong commitment to creating long-term sustainable value for its key stakeholders - customers, communities, employees, and owners - and to link executive compensation to successful execution on those strategies to achieve those objectives, the Talent and Compensation Committee decided to use the measures described below beginning in 2021 to collectively determine 40% of the EAM, with each of the measures weighted at 10%. These measures were selected because the committee considered them to represent key measures of the Company&#8217;s success in advancing strategies to create sustainable value for its stakeholders that may not be fully captured in its quarterly and annual financial results. \n\nFollowing is a summary description of each of these measures, including the metric or methodology used for determining the level of achievement and the rationale for each of the selected measures: \n\n##TABLE_START Measure Metrics and Targets Objective Safety Quantitative safety metric based on rate of serious injuries and fatalities per 100 employees or contractors (SIF rate). Minimum performance = second quartile, target = top quartile, and maximum performance = top decile of published EEI member SIF rate data as published in 2022, with no payout if any fatalities during the reporting year. \n\nEnsures Entergy maintains a safe and incident-free workplace for all of its employees and contractors. \n\nCustomer Net Promoter Score (NPS) \n\nQuantitative customer NPS metric is determined through a blind survey of residential customers who are asked how likely they are to recommend Entergy, on a scale of 1 to 10. The NPS is the percentage of promoters (scores 9-10) less the percentage of detractors (scores less than 6). Minimum performance = 5, target = 12, and maximum performance = 19. \n\n&#8226; \n\nIncentivizes actions that drive positive customer outcomes (as measured through customer feedback) including impacts on reliability improvements, responsiveness, continuous improvement, and innovation. \n\n&#8226; \n\nSignals overall health and loyalty of our customer relationship. \n\nDiversity, Inclusion &#38; Belonging (DIB) \n\nOverall qualitative assessment of DIB key performance indicators assessed in the workforce, workplace, and marketplace, informed by quantitative measures in the areas of increases in female, racially, and ethnically diverse representation, female, racially, and ethnically diverse director and above placements, inclusive climate survey scores, and diverse supplier managed spend; progress on DIB initiatives; and responsiveness to emergent issues. \n\n&#8226; \n\nReinforces Entergy&#8217;s commitment to be a fair and equitable work environment that is welcoming to all and allows us to attract and retain superb talent, allowing the Company to execute on its strategy. \n\n&#8226; \n\nRewards progress toward meeting Entergy&#8217;s commitment to develop and retain a workforce that reflects the rich diversity of the communities the Company serves. \n\n&#8226; \n\nDrives an engaged workforce; customer-centric service and solutions; enhancement of owner value; and community partnerships. \n\nEnvironmental Stewardship \n\nAssessment of progress toward environmental commitments through performance on publicly announced goals and other key initiatives. Goals set for 2022 included CO 2 emission rate and other air pollutant emission targets, overall progress towards interim climate goals and net zero by 2050 climate commitments, execution of renewables projects in various stages of development, publication of a TCFD-aligned climate report, developing an accelerated resilience plan, identifying and implementing customer decarbonization solutions, and progress on other planned environmental initiatives. \n\n&#8226; \n\nReinforces Entergy&#8217;s commitment to long-term sustainability and a reduced impact on the environment, in particular by advancing Entergy&#8217;s climate goals and commitments. \n\n&#8226; \n\nProvides accountability for accelerating completion of Entergy&#8217;s resilience investments and advancing Entergy&#8217;s customer electrification initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn determining the targets to set for 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee reviewed anticipated drivers and risks to the Company&#8217;s expectations for its adjusted earnings for 2022 as set forth in the Company&#8217;s financial plan, as well as factors driving the strong financial performance achieved in 2021. The Talent and Compensation Committee confirmed that the proposed plan targets for ETR Tax Adjusted EPS reflected significant growth in the \n\ncore earnings measure underlying the annual incentive target. The Talent and Compensation Committee also considered the potential impact of a wide range of identified risks and opportunities and confirmed that both the financial and non-financial annual incentive targets reflected a reasonable balancing of such risks and opportunities and an appropriate degree of challenge. The goals were designed to be achievable, but also to require the strong coordinated performance of the management team. \n\n2022 Performance Assessment \n\nIn January 2023 the Finance and Talent and Compensation Committees jointly reviewed the Company&#8217;s financial and operational results and assessed management&#8217;s performance against the performance objectives and targets described above in order to determine the EAM. The following table summarizes the annual incentive targets and performance results for 2022, resulting in an EAM of 145%: \n\n##TABLE_START Performance Measure Targets and Results Weighting Minimum Target Maximum 2022 Results Level of Achievement ETR Tax Adjusted EPS ($) 60% 6.00 6.30 6.60 6.58 195% Safety (SIF Rate) 10% 0.07 0.03 0.00 0.06 (1) \n\n44% Customer Net Promoter Score 10% 5.00 12.00 19.00 5.60 31% Diversity, Inclusion, &#38; Belonging 10% Qualitative assessment (2) \n\n90% Environmental Stewardship 10% Qualitative assessment (2) \n\n119% EAM 100% 25% 100% 200% 145% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) 2022 SIF results were 0.05 for employees and 0.07 for contractors. The employee and contractor targets and results were averaged to arrive at target and reported results. The 2022 target was top quartile employee SIF performance among electric utilities for 2022, as reported by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the maximum was top decile performance, and the minimum was 2nd quartile performance. \n\n(2) This qualitative assessment is informed by quantitative measures and is discussed below. \n\nIn assessing 2022 financial performance, the Finance and Talent and Compensation Committees reviewed various factors explaining how the 2022 ETR Tax Adjusted EPS result compared to the 2022 business plan and annual incentive target set in January 2022. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS exceeded the ETR Tax Adjusted EPS target of $6.30 per share by $0.28. This outperformance resulted in part from the fact that ETR Adjusted EPS exceeded the midpoint of the guidance set at the beginning of the year by $0.12 per share. The ETR Tax Adjusted EPS result also reflected a positive adjustment of $0.21 to ETR Adjusted EPS for 50% of the net benefit of tax strategy items impacting net income which had been excluded from ETR Adjusted EPS, as well as a negative adjustment of $0.05 to reflect the expense accrual that would be associated with funding the calculated EAM. \n\nIn assessing management&#8217;s 2022 performance on the non-financial measures, the committees focused particularly on the qualitative assessments required with respect to the Diversity, Inclusion, &#38; Belonging and Environmental Stewardship measures. In each area, the committees reviewed a wide range of quantitative and qualitative key performance indicators and assessed progress on strategies and initiatives that had been identified at the beginning of the performance period as key to achieving the Company&#8217;s strategic objectives. \n\nFollowing are selected performance milestones and highlights considered as part of the assessment: \n\n##TABLE_START Performance Measure 2022 Developments Diversity, Inclusion, &#38; Belonging \n\n&#8226; \n\nIncreased representation of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in employee population and at director level and above in management from 2021 \n\nLevel of Achievement \n\n&#8226; \n\nPiloted &#8220; All In &#8221;, a 5-month/100-person cohort development experience to build inclusive leadership capabilities at all levels \n\n&#8226; \n\n90% \n\n&#8226; \n\nLaunched &#8220;Amplify&#8221;, a 6-month learning journey bringing together top female leaders with racially and ethnically diverse women to foster relationships, allyship, development, and skill building \n\n&#8226; \n\nEntergy&#8217;s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) placed 6th in the Enterprise-Wide ERG category of the Diversity Impact Awards during the 2022 Global ERG Summit \n\n&#8226; \n\nReceived for the 5th consecutive year the U.S. Department of Labor Platinum Vets Medallion Award for veteran talent pipeline development, recruitment, retention, and a veteran's ERG \n\n&#8226; \n\nDiverse supplier managed spend fell from 2021 levels, driven by decreases in storm and non-recurring diverse spend \n\n&#8226; \n\nInclusive climate score remained flat \n\nEnvironmental Stewardship \n\n&#8226; \n\nUtility equity CO2 emission rate fell short of our 2022 goal of 617 lbs/MWh with an estimated emission rate of 695 lbs/MWh, largely due to higher natural gas prices resulting in more dispatch of our coal generation by the Midcontinent Independence System Operator (MISO) as compared to 2021 in addition to supporting reliability during extreme weather events (e.g. Winter Storm Elliott in the fourth quarter 2022) \n\nLevel of Achievement \n\n&#8226; \n\nDeveloped and announced a new interim climate goal to achieve 50% carbon-free energy capacity by 2030 \n\n&#8226; \n\n119% \n\n&#8226; \n\nContinued progress on advancing green tariff solutions for the benefit of customers \n\n&#8226; \n\nAdvanced renewable capacity requirements through the request for proposals (both owned and power purchase agreements), development, and construction processes, with just over 800 MW of renewables in service, 1,100 MW of active projects, and active solar and wind requests for proposals totaling 7,000 MW \n\n&#8226; \n\nProgress on studies of and engagements with various low- and zero-carbon technologies including advanced nuclear, offshore wind, energy storage, and hydrogen \n\n&#8226; \n\nPublished second TCFD-aligned climate report providing updated information on our path to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 \n\n&#8226; \n\nDeveloped and announced an accelerated resilience plan and began related regulatory filings \n\n&#8226; \n\nIncreased engagement with many of our industrial and commercial customers to identify opportunities to provide decarbonization solutions \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition to the foregoing financial and operational results, the Talent and Compensation Committee considered management&#8217;s degree of success in achieving various strategic operational and regulatory objectives and in overcoming certain challenges that arose in the business during the course of the year. \n\nUnder the annual incentive program, NEOs could earn a payout ranging from 0% to 200% of the NEO&#8217;s target opportunity, subject to the overall funding limitation determined by the EAM. To determine individual NEO annual incentive awards for members of the OCE, the Talent and Compensation Committee considered individual performance in executing on the Company&#8217;s strategies and delivering the strong financial performance and operational successes achieved in 2022, as well as the executive&#8217;s success in achieving individual goals within the executive&#8217;s scope of responsibilities. The committee also considered certain challenges the Company experienced during the year, particularly in relation to regulatory and customer relationships and each officer&#8217;s accountabilities and accomplishments in addressing those external challenges. With respect to Mr. Marsh and Ms. Fontan, the committee approved awards that were prorated based on the period of time served in each of the two positions held \n\nby the officer during 2022, the target opportunities for each such position, and the committee&#8217;s assessment of the officer&#8217;s performance in each such position. \n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Talent and Compensation Committee approved the following annual incentive payouts to each of the NEOs who are members of the OCE ranging from 125% to 144% of target. \n\nAfter the EAM was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive awards, Entergy&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. Individual awards were determined for the remaining NEOs who are not members of the OCE by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer&#8217;s key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. This resulted in payouts that ranged fro m 125% of target to 140% of t arget for the NEOs who are not members of the OCE. \n\nBased on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the NEOs received the following annual incentive payouts: \n\n##TABLE_START Named Executive Officer Year-End Base Salary Target as Percentage of Year-End Base Salary 2022 Target Award (1) \n\nPayout as Percentage of Target 2022 Annual Incentive Award A.

For Mr. Marsh and Ms. Fontan, the payout is stated as a percentage of the officer&#8217;s prorated incentive target, which was determined based on the period of time served in each of the positions held by such officer during the year and the base salary and target percentage for each such position. \n\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation \n\nOverview \n\nLong-term incentive compensation delivered in shares of Entergy common stock represents the largest portion of executive officer compensation. The Company believes the combination of long-term incentives it employs provides a compelling performance-based compensation opportunity, is effective at retaining a strong senior management team, and aligns the interests of the executive officers with the interests of Entergy&#8217;s customers and shareholders by enhancing executives&#8217; focus on the Company&#8217;s long-term goals. \n\nFor each NEO, a dollar value is established to determine that NEO&#8217;s long-term incentive awards. The award value for each NEO is determined based on market median compensation data for the officer&#8217;s role, adjusted to reflect individual performance and internal equity. In January 2022 the Talent and Compensation Committee approved the 2022 long-term incentive award target amounts for each NEO. This amount for each NEO was then \n\nconverted into the number of performance units, stock options, and shares of restricted stock granted to each NEO based on an allocation of 60% performance units, 20% stock options, and 20% restricted stock. \n\n##TABLE_START NEO Long-Term Incentive Grant Date Value (As of January 27, 2022) A.

West $2,084,696 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The amounts reported in the above table for Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Fontan, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, Ms. Rodriguez, and Mr. Viamontes were determined based on and are reflective of their pre-promotion positions. Mses. Fontan, Landreaux, and Rodriguez and Messrs. Fisackerly, Marsh, and Viamontes each experienced a change in officer status in 2022, and accordingly, their target PUP award opportunities were increased for the 2022 &#8211; 2024 performance period as follows: from 1,483 to 1,510 for Mr. Fisackerly; from 1,908 to 5,302 for Ms. Fontan; from 1,483 to 1,769 for Ms . Landreaux; from 9,810 to 23,118 for Mr. Marsh; from 1,145 to 1,254 for Ms. Rodriguez; and from 1,268 to 1,577 for Mr. Viamontes. \n\n2022 Long-Term Incentive Award Mix \n\nLong-Term Performance Units \n\nThe NEOs are issued performance unit awards under the PUP with payout opportunities established by the Talent and Compensation Committee at the beginning of each three-year performance period. \n\nThe PUP specifies a minimum, target, and maximum performance level, the achievement of which determines the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. For the 2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP performance period, the Talent and Compensation Committee chose the performance measures and targets set forth below, which were the same measures as used in the 2021-2023 PUP performance period. \n\n2022-2024 PUP Performance Period: Measures and Goals ##TABLE_START \n\nPerformance Measures (1) \n\nPUP Measure Weight Goals (2) \n\nRelative TSR 80% \n\nMinimum (25%) - Bottom of 3 rd Quartile \n\nTarget (100%) - Median Percentile \n\nMaximum (200%) - Top Quartile \n\nAdjusted FFO/Debt Ratio (3) \n\n20% Minimum (25%) - 14.0% Target (100%) - 15.0% Maximum (200%) - 16.5% ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation, between minimum and target and between target and maximum, with no payouts for performance below the minimum achievement level with respect to the applicable performance measure, and payouts are capped at the maximum achievement level with respect to the applicable performance measure. \n\n(2) No payout if the relative TSR falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and the Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio is below the minimum performance goal. \n\n(3) Results for the Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio will exclude the Pre-Determined Exclusions. \n\nPerformance Measures \n\nRelative TSR: \n\n&#8226; The Talent and Compensation Committee chose relative TSR as a performance measure because it reflects the Company&#8217;s creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities included in the Philadelphia Utility Index over the performance period. By measuring performance in relation to an industry benchmark, this measure is intended to isolate and reward management for the creation of shareholder value that is not driven by events that affect the industry as a whole. \n\n&#8226; Minimum, target, and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of Entergy&#8217;s TSR in relation to the TSR of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index. The Talent and Compensation Committee identified the Philadelphia Utility Index as the appropriate industry peer group for determining relative TSR because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, are viewed as comparable to the Company in terms of business and scale. \n\nAdjusted FFO/Debt Ratio: \n\n&#8226; To emphasize the importance of strong credit for the long-term health of our business, for the 2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP performance period we used the credit measure &#8211; Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio. \n\n&#8226; The Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio is the ratio of: (i) adjusted funds from operations calculated as operating cash flow adjusted for allowance for funds used during construction, working capital and the effects of securitization revenue, and the Pre-Determined Exclusions; to (ii) total debt, excluding outstanding or pending securitization debt. \n\n&#8226; The Talent and Compensation Committee decided to use this ratio because it emphasizes financial stability, noting that a financially healthy utility creates the capacity to make investments on behalf of customers, addresses the needs of our communities, provides low-cost access to capital markets, and promotes employee confidence. \n\n&#8226; To further underscore the importance of this measure, for the 2022 &#8211; 2024 performance period, the calculated PUP result, determined as set forth above, will be adjusted by &#177;10 basis points for a change in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s corporate credit outlook and &#177;20 basis points for an upgrade or downgrade in the corporate credit rating for Entergy Corporation. The maximum increase or decrease from adjustments made under this modifier is 20 basis points, and performance may not be reduced below zero or increased beyond 200%. \n\nStock Options and Restricted Stock \n\nThe Company grants stock options and shares of restricted stock as part of its long-term incentive award mix because it aligns the interests of the executive officers with long-term shareholder value, provides competitive compensation, and increases the executives&#8217; ownership in Entergy&#8217;s common stock. Generally, stock options are granted with a maximum term of ten years and vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The exercise price for each option granted in January 2022 was $109.59, which was the closing price of Entergy&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant. Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, are paid dividends which are reinvested in shares of Entergy stock and have full voting rights. The dividend reinvestment shares are subject to forfeiture similar to the terms of the original grant. \n\n2022 Long-Term Incentive Awards \n\nIn January 2022 the Talent and Compensation Committee granted the following PUP performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock to each NEO. In connection with their promotions during 2022 and as provided for by their initial grant letters and based on the competitive market data described above, Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Fontan, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, Ms. Rodriguez, and Mr. Viamontes each received a pro-rated upward adjustment in the number of target performance units awarded, for the performance periods that were open at the time of their promotion, including the 2022-2024 PUP performance period. For the 2022-2024 PUP performance period, the targeted PUP units were increased as follows: from 1,483 to 1,510 for Mr. Fisackerly; from 1,908 to 5,302 for Ms. Fontan; from 1,483 to 1,769 for Ms. Landreaux; 9,810 to 23,118 for Mr. Marsh; from 1,145 to 1,254 for Ms. Rodriguez; and from 1,268 to 1,577 for Mr. Viamontes. The number of performance units, options and shares of restricted stock were determined as discussed above under &#8220;Long-Term Incentive Compensation &#8211; Overview.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Named Executive Officer \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 \n\nTarget PUP Units \n\nStock Options Shares of Restricted Stock A.

West 9,525 24,740 3,785 ##TABLE_END\n\nAll of the performance units, the shares of restricted stock, and stock options granted to our NEOs in 2022 were granted pursuant to the 2019 OIP. The 2019 OIP requires both a change in control and an involuntary job loss without cause or a resignation by the NEO for good reason within 24 months following a change in control (a &#8220;double trigger&#8221;) for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control. \n\nPayouts for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 PUP Performance Period \n\nIn December 2019 the Talent and Compensation Committee chose relative TSR and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS as the performance measures for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 PUP performance period, with relative TSR weighted 80% and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS weighted 20%. Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, which adjusts Entergy&#8217;s as reported (GAAP) results to eliminate the impact of Entergy Wholesale Commodities and other non-routine items, was selected in 2019 as a performance measure because the committee wished to incentivize management to achieve steady, predictable earnings growth for the Company over the three-year performance period, and because it aligns with the earnings measure being used to communicate the Company&#8217;s earnings expectations externally to investors. Similar to the way targets are established for the annual incentive awards, targets for the Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS performance measure were established by the Talent and Compensation Committee after the Board&#8217;s review of the Company&#8217;s strategic plan. These targets also exclude the effect of major storms, the resolution of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, changes in federal income tax law and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities. The payout was determined based on the achievement of the following performance goals established for both performance measures by the committee at the beginning of the performance period: \n\n2020 &#8211; 2022 PUP Performance Period: Measure and Goals ##TABLE_START Performance Measure (1) \n\nPUP Measure Weight Payout Relative TSR 80% \n\nMinimum (25%) - Bottom of 3 rd Quartile \n\nTarget (100%) - Median Percentile \n\nMaximum (200%) - Top Quartile \n\nCumulative ETR Adjusted EPS ($) (2) \n\n20% Minimum (25%) - 16.07 Target (100%) - 17.85 Maximum (200%) - 19.63 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation. There is no payout for performance below the minimum achievement level and payouts are capped for performance at or above the maximum performance level. \n\n(2) EPS targets were established to drive multi-year key growth measures consistent with those that were externally communicated to investors at the time. \n\nIn January 2023 the Talent and Compensation Committee reviewed the Company&#8217;s relative TSR and the Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 PUP performance period in order to determine the payout to participants based upon the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 PUP performance period as provided above. The committee compared the Company&#8217;s TSR against the TSR of the companies that were included in the Philadelphia Utility Index as of the last day of the year preceding the three-year performance period, which were: \n\n##TABLE_START AES Corporation Edison International Ameren Corporation Eversource Energy American Electric Power Co.

PG&#38;E Corporation Dominion Energy Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc. DTE Energy Company Southern Company Duke Energy Corporation Xcel Energy, Inc. ##TABLE_END\n\nAs recommended by the Finance Committee, the Talent and Compensation Committee concluded that Entergy Corporation&#8217;s relative TSR for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 PUP performance period was in the fourth quartile, and that Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS was $18.46, yielding a payout of 27% of target for the NEOs. \n\n##TABLE_START Named Executive Officer \n\n2020 - 2022 Target PUP Performance Units Number of Shares Issued (1) \n\nValue of Shares Actually Issued (2) \n\nGrant Date Fair Value (3) \n\nA.

Fontan, Landreaux, and Rodriguez and Messrs. Fisackerly, Marsh, and Viamontes each experienced a change in officer status in 2022, and accordingly, their target award opportunities were increased for the 2020 &#8211; 2022 performance period as follows: from 9,560 to 10,222 for Mr. Marsh; from 1,400 to 1,588 for Ms. Fontan; from 950 to 1,013 for Mr. Fisackerly; from 950 to 1,013 for Ms. Landreaux; from 501 to 564 for Ms. Rodriguez; and from 924 to 986 for Mr. Viamontes. \n\nBenefits and Perquisites \n\nThe NEOs are eligible to participate in or receive the following benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START Plan Type Description Retirement Plans \n\nEntergy Corporation-sponsored: \n\nEntergy Retirement Plan - a tax-qualified final average pay defined benefit pension plan that covers a broad group of employees hired before July 1, 2014. \n\nCash Balance Plan - a tax-qualified cash balance defined benefit pension plan that covers a broad group of employees hired on or after July 1, 2014 and before January 1, 2021. \n\nPension Equalization Plan (PEP) - a non-qualified pension restoration plan for certain highly compensated non-bargaining employees who participate in the Entergy Retirement Plan. \n\nCash Balance Equalization Plan (CBEP) - a non-qualified restoration plan for a certain highly compensated non-bargaining employees who participate in the Cash Balance Plan. \n\nSystem Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) - a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for a select group of individuals who became executive officers before July 1, 2014. \n\nSee &#8220;2022 Pension Benefits&#8221; for additional information regarding the operation of the plans described above. \n\nSavings Plan Entergy Corporation-sponsored 401(k) Savings Plan that covers a broad group of employees and provides for an employer matching contribution. Health &#38; Welfare Benefits Medical, dental and vision coverage, health care and dependent care reimbursement plans, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, and basic long-term disability insurance. Eligibility, coverage levels, potential employee contributions, and other plan design features are the same for the NEOs as for the broad employee population. 2022 Perquisites Corporate aircraft usage and annual mandatory physical exams. The NEOs who are members of the OCE do not receive tax gross ups on any benefits, except for relocation assistance. In 2022, the NEOs who are not members of the OCE also were provided with club dues, relocation assistance, and tax gross up payments on these perquisites. For additional information regarding perquisites, see the &#8220;All Other Compensation&#8221; column in the 2022 Summary Compensation Table. Deferred Compensation The NEOs are eligible to defer up to 100% of their base salary and annual incentive awards into the Entergy Corporation sponsored Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Executive Disability Plan This plan pays eligible individuals a supplemental long-term disability (LTD) benefit if they are disabled and receiving LTD benefits from the broad-based LTD Plan. The benefit payable under this plan is equal to 65% of the difference between their annual base salary and the annual base salary that produces the maximum disability payment under our broad-based LTD plan, which is $15,000. ##TABLE_END\n\nEntergy Corporation provides these benefits to the NEOs as part of its effort to provide a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many of the companies with which it competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers. \n\nSeverance and Retention Arrangements \n\nSystem Executive Continuity Plan \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation as they help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the NEOs, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. In addition, the Talent and Compensation Committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as many of the companies with which Entergy Corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, Entergy Corporation has established a System Executive Continuity Plan (&#8220;Continuity Plan&#8221;) under which each of our NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Denault, is entitled to receive &#8220;change in control&#8221; payments and benefits if such officer&#8217;s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or if the officer resigns for good reason, in each case, in connection with a change in control of the Company. Mr. Denault became ineligible to participate in or receive any benefits under the Continuity Plan, effective November 1, 2022, pursuant to his resignation as CEO of Entergy. Entergy strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the Continuity Plan are consistent with market practices. Entergy&#8217;s executive officers, including the NEOs, are not entitled to any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. For more information regarding our severance arrangements, see &#8220;Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.&#8221; \n\nNuclear Retention Plan \n\nMr. Bakken participates in the Nuclear Retention Plan, a retention plan for officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry. The Talent and Compensation Committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry. Participation in the plan is limited to regular full-time employees of Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. recommended to, and approved for participation by, the CEO of Nuclear Operations and to employees of other Entergy System Companies approved for participation in the plan by the Talent and Compensation Committee or the CEO of Entergy. The plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year service period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant&#8217;s management level and continued employment. Each annual payment is equal to an amount ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee&#8217;s base salary as of their date of enrollment in the plan. This plan does not provide for accelerated or prorated payouts upon termination of employment. \n\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan, in May 2022, Mr. Bakken received a cash bonus equal to $196,223 or 30% of $ 654,078 , his base salary as of May 1, 2019. I n recognition of the value the Company places on Mr. Bakken as a member of the Company&#8217;s senior management team and his extensive experience in the nuclear industry, and to keep his pay competitive, i n May 2022, Mr. Bakken&#8217;s participation in the plan was renewed for another three-year period beginning on May 1, 2022. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Nuclear Retention Plan, in 2023, 2024 and 2025, Mr. Bakken is expected to be eligible to receive a cash bonus equal to $214,418, which is 30% of $714,728, his base salary as of May 1, 2022. The three-year period covered and percentage of base salary paid to Mr. Bakken under the plan are consistent with the terms of participation of other senior executive officers who participate in this plan. \n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nRestricted stock units granted under our 2019 OIP represent shares of our common stock that have an economic value equivalent to one share of our common stock. Entergy Corporation occasionally grants restricted stock units for retention purposes, to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or for other limited purposes. If all conditions of the grant are satisfied, restrictions on the restricted stock units lift at the end of the restricted period and the restricted stock units are settled in shares of Entergy common stock. Restricted stock units \n\nare generally time-based awards for which restrictions generally lift on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued satisfactory employment. \n\nIn November 2022 the Talent and Compensation Committee granted Mr. West 18,012 restricted stock units. Mr. West&#8217;s award was made in recognition of his senior leadership role and direction as the Company&#8217;s Group President, Utility Operations and to retain his deep knowledge of the utility industry and the Company&#8217;s utilities gained through his experience as Group President and his other senior management positions with the Company through the Company&#8217;s management succession process. Mr. West&#8217;s restricted stock units are scheduled to vest in three equal installments on June 1, 2024, 2025 and 2026, provided he satisfies the vesting criteria through each such date, including remaining continuously employed as Group President, Utility Operations or in a higher position, performing his job duties in a satisfactory manner, and actively preparing for the successful transition of his role, determined in the sole discretion of the CEO of Entergy Corporation. All of Mr. West&#8217;s restricted stock units will vest immediately if the Company experiences a change in control (as defined in the 2019 OIP) and (x) the outstanding restricted stock units are not assumed or substituted in accordance with the 2019 OIP, or (y) the outstanding restricted stock units are so assumed or substituted and Mr. West&#8217;s employment is terminated by his Entergy System Company employer without cause or by Mr. West for good reason within 24 months after the change in control. \n\nAdditionally, in November 2022 the Talent and Compensation Committee granted to each of Messrs. Fisackerly and May 4,053 restricted stock units, all of which will vest on October 1, 2025, provided they satisfy the vesting criteria through such date, including remaining continuously employed in their current positions or higher positions, performing their job duties in a satisfactory manner, and actively preparing for the successful transition of their roles, determined in the sole discretion of the CEO of Entergy Corporation. These awards were made to Messrs. Fisackerly and May in recognition of their senior leadership roles as President and Chief Executive Officer of Entergy Mississippi, LLC and of Entergy Louisiana, LLC, respectively, and to retain their deep industry knowledge of the utility industry and the Mississippi and Louisiana service territories. All of the restricted stock units awarded to Messrs. Fisackerly and May will vest immediately if the Company experiences a change in control (as defined in the 2019 OIP) and (x) the outstanding restricted stock units are not assumed or substituted in accordance with the 2019 OIP, or (y) the outstanding restricted stock units are so assumed or substituted and their employment is terminated by their respective Entergy System Company employers without cause or by them for good reason within 24 months after the change in control. \n\nRisk Mitigation and Other Pay Practices \n\nEntergy Corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as well as other companies in the S&#38;P 500. Some of these practices include the following: \n\nPolicy for Recoupment of Compensation (Clawback Provisions) \n\nUnder the Company&#8217;s policy regarding recoupment of certain compensation or, its clawback policy, the Company will seek reimbursement of certain compensation from current or former executive officers subject to Section 16, including all of the NEOs, where: \n\na. the Company is required to restate its financial statements due to noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws; or \n\nb. there is a material miscalculation of a performance measure related to incentive compensation, regardless of whether the Company&#8217;s financial statements are restated. \n\nIn addition, the Company may seek reimbursement of certain compensation from current or former executive officers subject to Section 16, including all of the NEOs, if the Board determines that an executive officer engaged in fraud that resulted in either a restatement of the Company&#8217;s financial statements or a material miscalculation of a performance measure relative to incentive compensation. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s clawback policy applies to incentive compensation, including cash or equity-based bonus or incentive or profit sharing awards paid during the three year period leading up to the date the Company is required to prepare such restatement or during the three-year period preceding the material miscalculation. The amount required to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment actually made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. The Company may enforce all or part of any executive officer&#8217;s repayment obligation under the policy by reducing any amounts that may be owing from time-to-time by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to such individual, whether as wages, severance, vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason. In addition, we will seek to recover any compensation received by Entergy Corporation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that is required to be reimbursed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 following a material restatement of our financial statements. \n\nThe Company is reviewing its clawback policy in light of the rules recently adopted by the SEC and effective in January 2023 directing the NYSE to adopt certain requirements for listed companies relating to clawback policies and will make any changes that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with the updated NYSE listing standards. \n\nStock Ownership Guidelines and Share Retention Requirements \n\nEntergy Corporation requires their NEOs to own Entergy stock to further align their interests with Entergy&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; interests. Annually, the Talent and Compensation Committee monitors the executive officers&#8217; compliance with these guidelines with all of the NEOs satisfying the applicable ownership guidelines at the time of the annual review. The ownership guidelines are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Role Value of Common Stock to be Owned Chief Executive Officer 6 x base salary Executive Vice Presidents 3 x base salary Senior Vice Presidents 2 x base salary Vice Presidents 1 x base salary ##TABLE_END\n\nFurther, to facilitate compliance with the guidelines, until an executive officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain: \n\n&#8226; all net after-tax shares paid out under the PUP; \n\n&#8226; all net after-tax shares of our restricted stock and all net after-tax shares received upon the vesting of restricted stock units; and \n\n&#8226; at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of Entergy Corporation stock options. \n\nTrading Controls \n\nExecutive officers, including the NEOs, are required to receive permission from the Company&#8217;s General Counsel or his designee prior to entering into any transaction involving Company securities, including gifts, other than an exercise of employee stock options that is not funded through a sale in the market. Trading is generally permitted only during specified open trading windows beginning shortly after the release of earnings. Employees who are subject to trading restrictions, including the NEOs, may enter into trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, but these trading plans or any amendment to an existing plan may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by the Company. \n\nNo Hedging/Pledging \n\nEntergy Corporation also prohibits directors and executive officers, including the NEOs, from pledging any Entergy Corporation securities or entering into margin accounts involving Entergy Corporation securities. Entergy Corporation prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of Entergy Corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the General Counsel. In addition, Entergy Corporation prohibits directors and executive officers, including the NEOs, from engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to Entergy securities. \n\nCompensation Consultant Independence \n\nAnnually, the Talent and Compensation Committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant to determine whether any conflicts of interest exist that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the Talent and Compensation Committee. When assessing the independence of its compensation consultant in 2022, the committee considered the following factors, among others: \n\n&#8226; Pay Governance has policies in place to prevent conflicts of interest; \n\n&#8226; No member of Pay Governance&#8217;s consulting team serving the committee has a business relationship with any member of the committee or any of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s executive officers; \n\n&#8226; Neither Pay Governance nor any of its principals own any shares of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s common stock; and \n\n&#8226; The amount of fees paid to Pay Governance is less than 1% of Pay Governance&#8217;s total consulting income. \n\nBased on these factors, the Talent and Compensation Committee concluded that Pay Governance is independent in accordance with SEC and NYSE rules and that no conflicts of interest exist that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the committee. \n\nIn addition, Pay Governance has agreed that it will not accept any engagement with management without prior approval from the Talent and Compensation Committee, and Entergy Corporation&#8217;s Board has adopted a policy that prohibits a compensation consultant from providing other services to it if the aggregate amount for those services would exceed $120,000 in any year. During 2022, Pay Governance did not provide any services to Entergy Corporation other than the services it performed on behalf of the Talent and Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees, and it worked with Entergy Corporation&#8217;s management only as directed by those committees. \n\nTALENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT \n\nThe Talent and Compensation Committee Report included in the 2023 Entergy Proxy Statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be &#8220;filed&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. None of the Registrant Subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. The board of directors of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of Entergy Corporation or one of the Registrant Subsidiaries. These boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the Registrant Subsidiaries. \n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES \n\n2022 Summary Compensation Table \n\nThe following table summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by each of the NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and to the extent required by SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For information on the principal positions held by each of the NEOs, see Item 10, &#8220;Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance of the Registrants.&#8221; \n\nThe compensation set forth in the table represents the aggregate compensation paid by all Entergy System companies.

Ms. Fontan was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective November 1, 2022. Effective January 31, 2023, Mr. Denault resigned from the position of Executive Chair and from the Board and Mr. Marsh was elected Chairman of the Board. Ms. Rodriguez was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy New Orleans in May 2021, and Mr. Viamontes was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy Texas in November 2021. \n\n(2) The amounts in column (c) represent the actual base salary paid to the NEOs in the applicable year. The 2022 changes in base salaries noted in the CD&#38;A were effective in April 2022. Additionally, as noted above in the CD&#38;A, Mr. Marsh&#8217;s and Ms. Fontan&#8217;s base salaries were further increased in November 2022 in conjunction with their promotions to their current positions. The 2020 base salary amounts include an amount attributable to an extra pay period that occurred in 2020 as the NEOs are paid on a bi-weekly basis. \n\n(3) The amount in column (d) represents the cash bonus paid to Mr. Bakken pursuant to the Nuclear Retention Plan. Additional information about this plan can be found under the heading &#8216;&#8216;Nuclear Retention Plan&#8217;&#8217; in the CD&#38;A. \n\n(4) The amounts in column (e) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock and performance units granted under the 2019 OIP, each calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, without taking into account estimated forfeitures. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock, restricted stock units, and the portion of the performance units with vesting based on the Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio is based on the closing price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the portion of the performance units attributable to relative TSR was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. The simulation model applies a risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is assumed to equal the yield on a three-year treasury bond on the grant date. Volatility is based on historical volatility for the 36-month period preceding the grant date. The performance units in the table are also valued based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance condition at the time of grant. The maximum value of shares that would be received if the highest achievement level is attained with respect to both the relative TSR and Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio, for performance units granted in 2022 are as follows: Mr. Bakken, $1,561,658; Mr. Denault, $9,177,943; Mr. Fisackerly, $394,343; Ms. Fontan, $1,594,140; Ms. Landreaux, $459,547; Mr. Marsh, $6,997,739; Mr. May, $629,266; Ms. Rodriguez, $350,504; Mr. Viamontes, $400,520; and Mr. West, $2,087,690. \n\n(5) The amounts in column (f) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options granted under the 2019 OIP calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in valuing these awards, see Note 12 to the financial statements. \n\n(6) The amounts in column (g) represent annual incentive award cash payments made under the 2019 OIP. \n\n(7) The amounts in column (h) include the annual actuarial change in the present value of these NEOs&#8217; benefits under all pension plans established by Entergy Corporation using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s financial statements and include amounts which the NEOs may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested. For 2022, the aggregate change in the actuarial present value was a decrease of $1,209,800 for Mr. Denault, a decrease of $465,800 for Mr. Fisackerly, a decrease of $544,900 for Ms. Fontan, a decrease of $238,000 for Ms. Landreaux, a decrease of $1,741,300 for Mr. Marsh, a decrease of $945,100 for Mr. May, a decrease of $415,000 for Ms. Rodriguez, and a decrease of $2,293,500 for Mr. West. The increases for Mr. Bakken and Mr. Viamontes were not attributable to above-market or preferential earnings on non-qualified deferred compensation. See &#8220;2022 Pension Benefits.&#8221; \n\n(8) The amounts in column (i) for 2022 include (a) matching contributions by Entergy Corporation under the Savings Plan to each of the NEOs; (b) dividends paid on restricted stock and performance units when vested; (c) life insurance premiums; (d) tax gross up payments on club dues and relocation assistance; and (e) perquisites and other compensation as described further below. The 2021 amounts for Mr. Denault have been updated as compared to the amount of All Other Compensation reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 to reflect the reimbursement by Mr. Denault of the incremental cost associated with the personal use of the corporate aircraft in 2021. Following 2021, Mr. Denault reimbursed the Company for the incremental cost associated with his personal usage of the corporate aircraft during 2021. Based on such reimbursement, his 2021 All Other Compensation excludes any cost associated with his personal usage of the corporate aircraft.

The amounts reported in the Total Without Change in Pension Value column may differ substantially from the amounts reported in the Total column required under SEC rules and are not a substitute for total compensation. Total Without Change in Pension Value represents total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, minus the change in pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column. The change in pension value is subject to many external variables, such as interest rates, assumptions about life expectancy, and changes in the discount rate determined at each year end, which are functions of economic factors and actuarial calculations that are not related to Entergy Corporation&#8217;s performance and are outside of the control of the Talent and Compensation Committee. \n\nPerquisites and Other Compensation \n\nThe amounts set forth in column (i) also include perquisites and other personal benefits that Entergy Corporation provides to its NEOs as part of providing a competitive executive compensation program and for employee retention. The following perquisites were provided to the NEOs in 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Named Executive Officer Relocation Personal Use of Corporate Aircraft Club Dues Executive Physical Exams A.

The other NEOs may use the corporate aircraft for personal travel subject to the approval of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. Annually, the Talent and Compensation Committee reviews the level of usage. Entergy Corporation believes that its officers&#8217; ability to use its plane for limited personal use saves time and helps to ensure their safety and security while traveling, thereby benefiting the Company. The amounts included in column (i) for the personal use of corporate aircraft, reflect the incremental cost to Entergy Corporation for use of the corporate aircraft, determined on the basis of the variable operational costs of each flight, including fuel, maintenance, flight crew travel expense, catering, communications, and fees, including flight planning, ground handling, and landing permits. The aggregate incremental aircraft usage cost associated with Mr. Denault&#8217;s personal use of the corporate aircraft was $61,644 for fiscal year 2022. In addition, Entergy Corporation offers its executives comprehensive annual physical exams at Entergy Corporation&#8217;s expense. \n\nEntergy Corporation also provides relocation benefits to a broad base of employees, which include assistance with moving expenses, transportation of household goods, and, in certain circumstances, assistance with the sale of the employee&#8217;s home. In connection with employment, and in accordance with its relocation policies, Entergy Corporation paid $132,830 in relocation expense for Mr. Viamontes in 2022.

The actual amounts awarded are reported in column (g) of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table. \n\n(2) The amounts in columns (f), (g), and (h) represent the minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the PUP. Performance under the program is measured by Entergy Corporation&#8217;s TSR relative to the TSR of \n\nthe companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio with TSR weighted eighty percent and Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio weighted twenty percent. There is no payout under the program if Entergy Corporation&#8217;s TSR falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Adjusted FFO/Debt Ratio is below the minimum performance goal. Subject to the achievement of performance targets, each unit will be converted into one share of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s common stock on the last day of the performance period for the 2022 - 2024 long-term PUP cycle (December 31, 2024). Accrued dividends on the shares earned will also be paid in Entergy Corporation common stock. \n\n(3) Except as noted in footnote 6 below, the amounts in column (i) represent shares of restricted stock granted under the 2019 OIP. Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date, have voting rights, and accrue dividends during the vesting period. \n\n(4) The amounts in column (j) represent options to purchase shares of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s common stock granted under the 2019 OIP. The options vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten-year term from the date of grant. \n\n(5) The amounts in column (l) are valued based on the aggregate grant date fair value of the award calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and, in the case of the performance units, are based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions. See footnotes 4 and 5 to the 2022 Summary Compensation Table for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value. \n\n(6) In November 2022, Messrs. Fisackerly, May, and West were awarded 4,053, 4,053, and 18,012 restricted stock units, respectively, under the 2019 OIP. The restricted units will vest in one installment on October 1, 2025 for Messrs. Fisackerly and May and in three equal installments on June 1, 2024, June 1, 2025, and June 1, 2026, for Mr. West, provided Messrs. Fisackerly, May, and West each satisfies the vesting criteria of his restricted stock unit agreement described in the CD&#38;A under the heading &#8220;Restricted Stock Units.&#8221; \n\n(7) Mses.

The amendment to the PEP terminated Mr. Denault&#8217;s participation in this plan. Mr. Denault retired and separated from employment with the Company on January 31, 2023. \n\n(3) Service under the SERP is granted from the date of hire. Service under the qualified Entergy Retirement Plan is granted from the later of the date of hire or the plan participation date. The SERP amounts reflected in the table for Mr. Denault and Mr. May are calculated based on 30 years of service pursuant to the terms of the SERP. \n\nRetirement Benefits \n\nThe tables below contain summaries of the pension benefit plans sponsored by Entergy Corporation that the NEOs participated in during 2022. Benefits for the NEOs who participate in these plans are determined using the same formulas as for other eligible employees. \n\nQualified Retirement Benefits \n\n##TABLE_START Entergy Retirement Plan Cash Balance Plan (1) \n\nEligible Named Executive Officers Haley R.

Christopher Bakken, III Eliecer Viamontes Eligibility Non-bargaining employees hired before July 1, 2014 Non-bargaining employees hired on or after July 1, 2014 and before January 1, 2021. Vesting A participant becomes vested in the Entergy Retirement Plan upon attainment of at least 5 years of vesting service or upon attainment of age 65 while actively employed by an Entergy system company. A participant becomes vested in the Cash Balance Plan upon attainment of at least 3 years of vesting service or upon attainment of age 65 while actively employed by an Entergy system company. Form of Payment Upon Retirement Benefits are payable as an annuity. For employees who separate from service on or after January 1, 2018, a single lump sum distribution may be elected by the participant if eligibility criteria are met. Benefits are payable as an annuity or single lump sum distribution. ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Entergy Retirement Plan Cash Balance Plan (1) \n\nRetirement Benefit Formula Benefits are calculated as a single life annuity payable at age 65 and generally are equal to 1.5% of a participant&#8217;s Final Average Monthly Earnings (FAME) multiplied by years of service (not to exceed 40). Earnings for the purpose of calculating FAME generally includes the employee&#8217;s base salary and eligible annual incentive awards subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and excludes all other bonuses. Executive annual incentive awards are not eligible for inclusion in earnings under this plan. FAME is calculated using the employee&#8217;s average monthly earnings for the 60 consecutive months in which the employee&#8217;s earnings were highest during the 120 month period immediately preceding the employee&#8217;s retirement and includes up to 5 eligible annual incentive awards paid during the 60 month period. The normal retirement benefit at age 65 is determined by converting the sum of an employee&#8217;s annual pay credits and his or her annual interest credits into an actuarially equivalent annuity. Pay credits ranging from 4-8% of an employee&#8217;s eligible earnings are allocated annually to a notional account for the employee based on an employee&#8217;s age and years of service. Earnings for purposes of calculating an employee&#8217;s pay credit include the employee&#8217;s base salary and annual incentive awards subject to Code limitations and exclude all other bonuses. Executive annual incentive awards are eligible for inclusion in earnings under this plan. Interest credits are calculated based upon the annual rate of interest on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities, as specified by the Internal Revenue Service, for the month of August preceding the first day of the applicable calendar year subject to a minimum rate of 2.6% and a maximum rate of 9%. \n\nBenefit Timing (2) \n\nNormal retirement age under the plan is 65. A reduced terminated vested benefit may be commenced as early as age 55. The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65 and 6% per year for each additional year commencement precedes age 65. A subsidized early retirement benefit may be commenced by employees who are at least age 55 with 10 years of service at the time they separate from service. The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65. Normal retirement age under the plan is 65. A vested cash balance benefit can be commenced as early as the first day of the month following separation from service. The amount of the benefit is determined in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit described above in the &#8220;Retirement Benefit Formula&#8221; section. ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Effective January 1, 2022, the Entergy Corporation Cash Balance Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees merged into and became Appendix J of the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees, but retained its eligibility, benefit formula, and all benefits, rights and features. \n\n(2) As of December 31, 2022, Messrs. Fisackerly, Denault, and May and Ms. Rodriguez were eligible for early retirement under the Entergy Retirement Plan. \n\nNon-qualified Retirement Benefits \n\nThe NEOs are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income in addition to the benefit provided under the qualified retirement plans, including the PEP, the CBEP, and the SERP. Upon separation from the Company, those NEOs who participate in both the PEP and the SERP will be paid only the greater of the benefit under the PEP or the SERP. Each of the SERP, PEP, and Cash Balance Equalization Plan is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to key management employees. In general, upon disability, participants in the PEP and the SERP remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement eligibility. Generally, spouses of \n\nparticipants who die before commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant&#8217;s accrued benefit. \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Equalization Plan Cash Balance Equalization Plan System Executive Retirement Plan Eligible Named Executive Officers Haley R.

Benefits generally are equal to the actuarial present value of a specified percentage, based on the participant&#8217;s years of service (including supplemental service granted under the plan) and management level of the participant&#8217;s &#8220;Final Average Monthly Compensation&#8221; (which is generally 1/36th of the sum of the participant&#8217;s base salary and annual incentive plan award for the 3 highest years during the last 10 years preceding separation from service), after first being reduced by the value of the participant&#8217;s Entergy Retirement Plan benefit. Benefit timing Payable at age 65 Benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same reduced terminated vested or early retirement reduction factors as benefits payable under the Entergy Retirement Plan as described above. An employee with supplemental credited service who terminates employment prior to age 65 must receive prior written consent of the Entergy employer in order to receive the portion of their benefit attributable to their supplemental credited service agreement. Benefits payable upon separation from service subject to the 6 month delay required under the Code Section 409A. Payable upon separation from service subject to six month delay required under the Code Section 409A.

Under the System Executive Continuity Plan (the &#8220;Continuity Plan&#8221;), executive officers, including each of the NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Denault, are eligible to receive the cash severance payment and welfare plan benefits described below if their employment is terminated by their Entergy System employer other than for Cause (as defined below) or if they terminate their employment for Good Reason during a period beginning with a potential change in control and ending 24 months following the effective date of a Change in Control (a &#8220;Qualifying Termination&#8221;). Mr. Denault became ineligible to participate in or receive any benefits under the Continuity Plan, effective November 1, 2022, pursuant to his resignation as CEO of Entergy Corporation, and retired and separated from employment with the Company on January 31, 2023. A participant will not be eligible for benefits under the Continuity Plan if such participant: accepts employment with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; elects to receive the benefits of another severance or separation program; removes, copies, or fails to return any property belonging to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates the non-compete \n\nprovision of the Continuity Plan (which generally runs for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law). The Continuity Plan does not include any provisions for the waiver of a breach of any of these restrictive covenants. \n\nIn addition, under the 2019 OIP or an applicable equity award agreement issued under the 2019 OIP, upon a Qualifying Termination, our executive officers, including the NEOs, are eligible for the payments and benefits described in the table below under &#8220;Performance Units&#8221; and &#8220;Equity Awards.&#8221; Further, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, our executive officers, including our NEOs, are eligible for the benefits described in the table below for &#8220;Retirement Benefits&#8221; under the terms of the SERP, PEP, and/or CBEP, as applicable. \n\nIn the event of a Qualifying Termination, the executive officers, including the NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Denault, would receive lump sum severance payments and welfare benefits described below. In the event of a Qualifying Termination, all of the NEOs, including Mr. Denault (prior to his separation from the Company on January 31, 2023), would receive the treatment described below for their retirement benefits and their outstanding performance units and equity awards: \n\n##TABLE_START Compensation Element Payment and/or Benefit** Severance* A lump sum severance payment equal to a multiple of the sum of: (a) the participant&#8217;s annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason, plus (b) the participant&#8217;s annual incentive award, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive program for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs. Performance Units For outstanding performance units, participants would receive a number of shares of Entergy common stock equal to the greater of (1) the target number of performance units subject to the performance unit agreement or (2) the number of units that would vest under the performance unit agreement calculated based on Company performance through the participant&#8217;s termination date, in either case pro-rated based on the portion of the performance period that occurs through the termination date. Equity Awards All unvested stock options and restricted stock units will vest immediately, and restrictions will lift on restricted shares, upon a Qualifying Termination pursuant to the terms of Entergy&#8217;s equity plans. Retirement Benefits Benefits already accrued under the SERP, PEP, and CBEP, if any, will become fully vested. Welfare Benefits Participants who are not retirement-eligible would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for a period ranging from 12 to 18 months. ##TABLE_END\n\n* Cash severance payments are capped at 2.99 times the sum of (a) an executive&#8217;s annual base salary in effect at any time within one year before commencement of the change in control period, or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting Good Reason under the Continuity Plan in effect at any time within one year before commencement of the change in control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting Good Reason under the Continuity Plan, plus (b) the higher of the executive&#8217;s actual annual incentive payment under the annual incentive program for the year immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs or the average of the executive&#8217;s target annual incentive award for the two calendar years preceding the year in which termination occurs. Any cash severance payments to be paid under the Continuity Plan in excess of this cap will be forfeited by the participant. \n\n** Prior to his separation from the Company on January 31, 2023, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, Mr. Denault would have received the greater of the payments and benefits described in the table above for which he was eligible or those payments and benefits provided for by the retention agreement entered into between Mr. Denault and the Company. See &#8220;Mr. Denault&#8217;s 2006 Retention Agreement&#8221; for a description of the payments and benefits Mr. Denault would have received in the event of a Qualifying Termination in connection with a change in control. \n\nTo protect shareholders and Entergy Corporation&#8217;s business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete provisions (which generally run for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law) and confidentiality provisions, as discussed above. If an executive discloses non-public data or information concerning Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received under the Continuity Plan. \n\nFor purposes of the Continuity Plan, the following events are generally defined as: \n\n&#8226; Change in Control : (a) the purchase of 30% or more of either Entergy Corporation&#8217;s common stock or the combined voting power of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s voting securities; (b) the merger or consolidation of Entergy Corporation (unless its Board members constitute at least a majority of the board members of the surviving entity); (c) the liquidation, dissolution, or sale of all or substantially all of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s assets; or (d) a change in the composition of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s Board such that, during any two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the period no longer constitute a majority of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s Board at the end of the period. \n\n&#8226; Potential Change in Control : (a) Entergy Corporation or an affiliate enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control; (b) the Entergy Corporation Board adopts resolutions determining that, for purposes of the Continuity Plan, a potential Change in Control has occurred; (c) a System Company or other person or entity publicly announces an intention to take actions that would constitute a Change in Control; or (d) any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner (directly or indirectly) of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock constituting 20% or more of the voting power or value of the Entergy Corporation&#8217;s outstanding common stock. \n\n&#8226; Cause: The participant&#8217;s (a) willful and continuous failure to perform substantially his or her duties after written demand for performance; (b) engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; (c) conviction or guilty or nolo contendere plea to a felony or other crime that materially and adversely affects the participant&#8217;s ability to perform his or her duties or Entergy Corporation&#8217;s reputation; (d) material violation of any agreement with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or (e) disclosure of any of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s confidential information without authorization. \n\n&#8226; Good Reason : The participant&#8217;s (a) nature or status of duties and responsibilities is substantially altered or reduced; (b) salary is reduced by 5% or more; (c) primary work location is relocated outside the continental United States; (d) compensation plans are discontinued without an equitable replacement; (e) benefits or number of vacation days are substantially reduced; or (f) employment is terminated by an Entergy employer for reasons other than in accordance with the Continuity Plan. \n\nOther Termination Events \n\nFor termination events, other than in connection with a Change in Control, the executive officers, including the NEOs, generally will receive the benefits set forth below: \n\n##TABLE_START Termination Event Compensation Element Severance Annual Incentive Stock Options Restricted Stock (2) \n\nPerformance Units Voluntary Resignation None \n\nForfeited (1) \n\nUnvested options are forfeited.

As discussed in the CD&#38;A, certain officers are occasionally granted restricted stock units for retention purposes, to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or for other limited purposes. The treatment of restricted stock units depends on the terms of the individual restricted stock unit agreement, which terms can vary. The standard off-cycle restricted stock unit agreement approved by the Talent and Compensation Committee provides that the units are forfeited if employment is terminated for any reason before the vesting date, except in the case of a termination other than for cause or voluntary termination for Good Reason during a Change in Control period. However, individual restricted stock unit agreements may provide for accelerated vesting in certain events, such as death or disability. Messrs. Bakken, Fisackerly, May, and West each have outstanding restricted stock units, the treatment of which upon various events of termination is disclosed in connection with the table below. \n\n(3) If an officer resigns after the completion of a PUP performance period, he or she will receive a payout under the PUP based on the outcome of the performance period. \n\nMr. Denault&#8217;s 2006 Retention Agreement \n\nIn 2006, the Company entered into a retention agreement with Mr. Denault that provided benefits to him in addition to, or in lieu of, the benefits described above. As a result of Mr. Denault&#8217;s retirement on January 31, 2023, the retention agreement is no longer effective. \n\nPrior to Mr. Denault&#8217;s retirement on January 31, 2023, his retention agreement provided that in the event of a Termination Event (as defined in his retention agreement): (1) Mr. Denault was entitled to a Target PUP Award calculated by using the average annual number of performance units with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his employment termination occurred, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target; and (2) all of Mr. Denault&#8217;s unvested stock options would immediately vest and restrictions would lift immediately on all restricted stock. \n\nPrior to Mr. Denault&#8217;s retirement on January 31, 2023, his retention agreement provided that in the event of death or disability, Mr. Denault would have received the greater of the Target PUP Award calculated as described above for a Termination Event under his retention agreement or the pro-rated number of performance units for each open performance period, based on the actual achievement level for each such open performance period and number of months of his participation in each open performance period, as provided for by the applicable PUP Performance Unit Agreements for the open PUP Performance Periods. \n\nUnder the terms of his 2006 retention agreement, the Company was entitled to terminate Mr. Denault&#8217;s employment for cause upon Mr. Denault&#8217;s: (a) continuing failure to substantially perform his duties (other than because of physical or mental illness or after he has given notice of termination for good reason) that remains uncured for 30 days after receiving a written notice from the Talent and Compensation Committee; (b) willfully engaging in conduct that was demonstrably and materially injurious to Entergy; (c) conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime that had or may have had a material adverse effect on his ability to carry out his duties or upon Entergy&#8217;s reputation; (d) material violation of any agreement that he has entered into with Entergy; or (e) unauthorized disclosure of Entergy&#8217;s confidential information. \n\nThe retention agreement further provided that Mr. Denault was entitled to terminate his employment for good reason upon: (a) the substantial reduction in the nature or status of his duties or responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the date of the retention agreement, other than de minimis acts that were remedied after notice from Mr. Denault; (b) a reduction of 5% or more in his base salary as in effect on the date of the retention agreement; (c) the relocation of his principal place of employment to a location other than the corporate headquarters; (d) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans providing opportunities for equity awards, incentive compensation, and other plans on a basis not materially less favorable than enjoyed at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); (e) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans with opportunities for benefits not materially less favorable than those enjoyed by him under any of our pension, savings, life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability, or vacation plans or policies at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); or (d) any purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his retention agreement. \n\nAggregate Termination Payments \n\nThe tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the NEOs would have received if his or her employment had been terminated as of December 31, 2022 under the various scenarios described above. For purposes of these tables, a stock price of $112.50 was used, which was the closing market price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 30, 2022, the last trading day of the year. \n\n##TABLE_START Benefits and Payments Upon Termination Voluntary Resignation For Cause Termination for Good Reason or Not for Cause Retirement Disability Death Termination Related to a Change in Control A.

As previously discussed, Mr. Denault did not participate in the PEP as of December 31, 2022 and Ms. Rodriguez does not participate in the SERP. For a description of these benefits, see &#8220;2022 Pension Benefits.&#8221; Mr. Denault retired and separated from employment with the Company on January 31, 2023. \n\n(2) See &#8220;2022 Pension Benefits&#8221; for a description of the pension benefits Mr. Bakken, Ms. Fontan, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, Mr. Viamontes, and Mr. West may receive upon the occurrence of certain termination events. \n\n(3) Pursuant to Mr. Denault&#8217;s retention agreement, if Mr. Denault&#8217;s employment were terminated by his Entergy employer without cause or by Mr. Denault for good reason (as those terms are defined in his retention agreement), he would receive a Target PUP Award equal to that number of PUP performance units calculated by taking an average of the target PUP performance units from the 2018 &#8211; 2020 PUP Performance Period (42,700) and from the 2019 &#8211; 2021 PUP Performance Period (40,508), which amounts to 41,604 performance units. For purposes of the table, the value of such PUP performance units is calculated by multiplying 41,604 by the closing price of Entergy stock on December 30, 2022 ($112.50), which equals $4,680,450. In the event of death or disability, Mr. Denault would receive the greater of the Target PUP Award calculated as described immediately above or the sum of the prorated amounts that would be payable under the provisions of each performance period, as described in footnote 4 below. Mr. Denault retired and separated from employment with the Company on January 31, 2023. \n\n(4) For purposes of the table, in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each NEO, other than Mr. Denault, would receive a number of performance units for the 2021 &#8211; 2023 performance period and a number of performance units for the 2022 &#8211; 2024 performance period, calculated as follows: \n\nThe greater of (1) the target number of performance units subject to the performance unit agreements or (2) the number of performance units that would vest under the performance unit agreements calculated based on Entergy Corporation&#8217;s actual performance through the NEO&#8217;s termination date, in either case pro-rated based on the portion of the performance periods that occurs through the termination date. \n\nMr. Denault would receive the greater of the number of performance units calculated as described in the paragraph above or the Target PUP Award calculated as described in footnote 3 immediately above. \n\nFor purposes of the table, the values of the performance unit awards for the performance periods for each NEO were calculated as follows, based on the assumption that the target number of performance units was the greater number: \n\nMr. Bakken&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 6,504 (24/36*9,755) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $731,700 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 2,375 (12/36*7,125) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $267,188 \n\nTotal: $998,888 \n\nMr. Denault&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 34,910 (24/36*52,365) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $3,927,375 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 13,958 (12/36*41,874) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $1,570,275 \n\nTotal: $5,497,650 \n\nMs. Fontan&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 2,786 (24/36*4,179) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $313,425 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 1,768 (12/36*5,302) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $198,900 \n\nTotal: $512,325 \n\nMr. Fisackerly&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 1,260 (24/36*1,889) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $141,750 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 504 (12/36*1,510) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $56,700 \n\nTotal: $198,450 \n\nMs. Landreaux&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 1,228 (24/36*1,841) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $138,150 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 590 (12/36*1,769) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $66,375 \n\nTotal: $204,525 \n\nMr. Marsh&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 13,911 (24/36*20,866) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $1,564,988 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 7,706 (12/36*23,118) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $866,925 \n\nTotal: $2,431,913 \n\nMr. May&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 1,442 (24/36*2,162) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $162,225 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 957 (12/36*2,871) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $107,663 \n\nTotal: $269,888 \n\nMs. Rodriguez&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 1,072 (24/36*1,608) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $120,600 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 418 (12/36*1,254) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $47,025 \n\nTotal: $167,625 \n\nMr. Viamontes&#8217;: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 1,292 (24/36*1,938) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $145,350 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 526 (12/36*1,577) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $59,175 \n\nTotal: $204,525 \n\nMr. West&#8217;s: \n\n2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period: 7,152 (24/36*10,727) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $804,600 \n\n2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period: 3,175 (12/36*9,525) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $112.50 = $357,188 \n\nTotal: $1,161,788 \n\nIn the event of retirement, in the case of Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, or Ms. Rodriguez each would receive a prorated portion of the applicable Achievement Level of PUP Performance Units for each open PUP Performance Period, based on his or her full months of participation in such PUP Performance Period, provided he or she has completed a minimum of 12 months of full-time employment in the applicable PUP Performance Period. For purposes of calculating for the above table the number of performance units Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rodriguez would receive in the event of retirement, it is assumed the achievement levels for the 2021 &#8211; 2023 PUP Performance Period and the 2022 &#8211; 2024 PUP Performance Period are at target. The resulting number of performance units and values are the same as calculated above for a qualifying termination related to a change in control. \n\nIn the event of death or disability of any NEO, other than Mr. Denault, the NEO or his or her estate would receive a prorated portion of the applicable Achievement Level of PUP Performance Units for each open PUP Performance Period, based on his or her full months of participation in such PUP Performance Period, with no required minimum amount of full-time employment in the applicable PUP Performance Period. \n\nIn the event of death or disability of Mr. Denault, he or his estate would receive the greater of (1) the Target PUP Award under his retention agreement, calculated by using the average annual number of PUP Performance Units with respect to the two most recent PUP Performance Periods preceding the calendar year in which his employment terminates due to death or disability, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target, or (2) the prorated portion of the applicable Achievement Level of PUP Performance Units for each open PUP Performance Period, based on his full months of participation in such PUP Performance Period. \n\n(5) Upon retirement, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rodriguez would be eligible for retiree medical and dental benefits, the same as all other retirees. \n\n(6) Pursuant to the Executive Continuity Plan, in the event of a termination related to a Change in Control, Mr. Bakken, Ms. Fontan, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, Mr. Viamontes, and Mr. West would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for 18 months. \n\n(7) Mr. Bakken&#8217;s 10,000 restricted stock units vest on April 6, 2025. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, if he resigns and terminates his employment after April 6, 2022 and prior to April 6, 2025, the Chief Executive Officer, subject to the approval of the Talent and Compensation Committee, may provide that Mr. Bakken shall vest upon his termination in a Pro Rata Portion of the restricted units. The Pro Rata Portion is determined by multiplying 10,000 restricted units by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days \n\nafter April 6, 2022 that precede the effective date of his termination of employment and the denominator of which is 1,096. In the event of a change in control, the unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon Mr. Bakken&#8217;s Qualifying Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, Mr. Bakken is subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates or solicit its employees or customers during and for 12 months after his employment with his Entergy employer. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. Bakken&#8217;s ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates. In the event of a breach of these restrictions, other than following certain constructive terminations of his employment, Mr. Bakken will forfeit any restricted stock units that are not yet vested and paid and must repay to Entergy any shares of Entergy stock paid to him in respect of the restricted stock units and any amounts he received upon the sale or transfer of any such shares. \n\n(8) Mr. Fisackerly&#8217;s 4,053 restricted stock units are scheduled to vest 100% on October 1, 2025. In the event of a Change in Control, the unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon Mr. Fisackerly&#8217;s Qualifying Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, Mr. Fisackerly is subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates during and for 12 months after his employment with Entergy, or to solicit its employees or customers during and for 24 months after his employment with Entergy. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. Fisackerly&#8217;s ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates. In the event of a breach of these restrictions, other than following certain constructive terminations of his employment, Mr. Fisackerly must repay to Entergy any shares of Entergy stock paid to him in respect of the restricted stock units and any amounts he received upon the sale or transfer of any such shares. \n\n(9) Mr. May&#8217;s 4,053 restricted stock units are scheduled to vest 100% on October 1, 2025. In the event of a Change in Control, the unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon Mr. May&#8217;s Qualifying Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, Mr. May is subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates during and for 12 months after his employment with Entergy, or to solicit its employees or customers during and for 24 months after his employment with Entergy. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. May&#8217;s ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates.

The pay ratio estimate for each of the Utility operating companies has been calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. \n\nIdentification of Median Employee \n\nFor each of the Utility operating companies, October 21, 2022 was selected as the date on which to determine the median employee. This date is different from the date used in the prior year; however, the methodology used to determine the date is consistent with that used in the prior year. Both dates correspond to the first day of the three month period prior to fiscal year-end for which information can be obtained about employees and all subsidiaries have the same number of pay cycles. To identify the median employee from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; employee population base, all compensation included in Box 5 of Form W-2 was considered with all before-tax deductions added back to this compensation (&#8220;Box 5 Compensation&#8221;). For purposes of determining the median employee of each Utility operating company, Box 5 Compensation was selected as it is believed to be representative of the compensation received by the employees of each respective Utility operating company and is readily available. The calculation of annual total compensation of the median employee for each Utility operating company is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table with respect to each of the NEOs. \n\nEntergy Arkansas Ratio \n\nFor 2022, \n\n&#8226; The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s employees, other than Ms. Landreaux, was $124,306. \n\n&#8226; Ms. Landreaux&#8217;s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was $1,090,465. \n\n&#8226; Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mrs. Landreaux to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 9:1. \n\nEntergy Louisiana Ratio \n\nFor 2022, \n\n&#8226; The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s employees, other than Mr. May, was $132,014. \n\n&#8226; Mr. May&#8217;s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was $1,875,055. \n\n&#8226; Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. May to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 14:1. \n\nEntergy Mississippi Ratio \n\nFor 2022, \n\n&#8226; The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s employees, other than Mr. Fisackerly, was $122,637. \n\n&#8226; Mr. Fisackerly&#8217;s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was $1,591,069. \n\n&#8226; Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Fisackerly to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 13:1. \n\nEntergy New Orleans Ratio \n\nFor 2022, \n\n&#8226; The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s employees, other than Ms. Rodriguez, was $109,847. \n\n&#8226; Ms. Rodriguez&#8217;s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was $895,489. \n\n&#8226; Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Ms. Rodriguez to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 8:1. \n\nEntergy Texas Ratio \n\nFor 2022, \n\n&#8226; The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Texas&#8217;s employees, other than Mr. Viamontes, was $121,845. \n\n&#8226; Mr. Viamontes&#8217; annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table, was $1,118,688. \n\n&#8226; Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Viamontes to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 9:1. \n\n"

For other permissible services not included in the engagement letter, Entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service, including a budget estimate, to the Audit Committee for pre-approval. Management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service is consistent with the SEC&#8217;s rules on auditor independence prior to submission to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, at its discretion, will pre-approve permissible services and has established the following additional guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor: \n\na Aggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the approved audit service fee. \n\nb All other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it is a highly qualified provider of that service or if the Audit Committee pre-approves the independent audit firm to provide the service. \n\n3. The Audit Committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-approved services actually provided by the independent auditor. \n\n4. To ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the Audit Committee delegates to the Audit Committee Chair or its designee the authority to approve permissible services and fees. The Audit Committee Chair or designee will report action taken to the Audit Committee at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. \n\n5. The Vice President and General Auditor will be responsible for tracking all independent auditor fees and will report quarterly to the Audit Committee. \n\nPART IV \n\n"
