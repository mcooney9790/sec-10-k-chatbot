Our expansive range of standard products is supplemented by an array of custom-designed solutions.\n\n##TABLE_END The Communications Solutions segment&#8217;s major competitors include Amphenol, Molex, JST, and Korea Electric Terminal (KET).\n\nCustomers \n\nAs an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.\n\nOur approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers.\n\nWe manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors.\n\nNo single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020.\n\nSales and Distribution \n\nWe maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region (1) as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\nAsia&#8211;Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n% \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nEurope/Middle East/Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAmericas\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n% \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nNet sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale. \n\n##TABLE_END We sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2022, our direct sales represented approximately 75% of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors.\n\nWe maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers&#8217; locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.\n\nSeasonality and Backlog \n\nTypically, we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.\n\nCertain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.\n\nCustomer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal Year End \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nTransportation Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n3,179 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n3,014 \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndustrial Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,447 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,851 \n\n&#8203; \n\nCommunications Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n6,496 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n5,841 \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2022 will be filled during fiscal 2023. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.\n\nCompetition \n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2022 and 2021.\n\nRaw Materials \n\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures.\n\nIntellectual Property \n\nPatents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.\n\nWe own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.\n\nWhile we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nWe have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2022, we employed approximately 92,000 people worldwide, including contract employees. Approximately 27,000 were in the Asia&#8211;Pacific region, 37,000 were in the EMEA region, and 28,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 56,000 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company&#8217;s success. \n\nOur core values&#8212;integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation&#8212;govern us. They guide our decisions and our actions, both individually and as an organization. Additionally, our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose&#8212;to create a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices. We aspire to have more than 26% women in leadership roles by fiscal 2025 and are committed to increasing the total number of women across all levels of the organization. Additionally, as part of its charter, the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors oversees our policies and practices related to the management of human capital resources including talent management, culture, diversity, and inclusion. \n\nWe embrace diversity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. To drive our business outcomes globally, we believe we must build a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve. We are also committed to a work environment where all employees are engaged, feel differences are valued and mutually-respected, and believe that all opinions count. Our people reflect our customers and markets. Our employees are in over 55 countries representing approximately 125 nationalities, and our total employee population is over 40% women. Our employee resource groups (&#8220;ERGs&#8221;) are company-sponsored, voluntary, employee-led groups that focus on diverse talent segments or shared experiences of employees. These groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. As of fiscal year end 2022, we had eight ERGs&#8212;ALIGN (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning employees and their allies), Women in Networking, TE Young Professionals, African Heritage, Asian Heritage, Latin Heritage, THRIVE (employees and their allies with mental, emotional, and physical disabilities), and TE Veterans. Our ERGs have a total of over 8,000 members. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we conducted our third annual employee engagement survey, which was a fully digital, enterprise-wide survey available in 17 languages and focused on measuring engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. We had a participation rate of over 85% in fiscal 2022 and year over year improvement in all three indices of engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. Our engagement and inclusion scores were once again favorable when compared to Glint Inc.&#8217;s external global manufacturing benchmark . By fiscal 2025, we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion. In addition to the overall improvement in our leadership effectiveness index, all nine scores within the index also increased from fiscal 2021 levels. \n\nWe continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful. Our LEARN@TE platform supplements our talent development strategies. It is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Strategy, execution, and talent (&#8220;SET&#8221;) leadership expectations, which focus on how we drive strategy, effectively execute, and build talent, have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs. We integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance, and develop and reward our people. \n\nWe are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering, and operations, as well as the diversity of our talent. We are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical \n\nroles. Also, our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions.\n\nWe are committed to the safety, health, human rights, and well-being of our employees. We continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards through our environmental, health, and safety team. Compliance audits and internal processes are in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards, and we aim to reduce our Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) total recordable incident rate&#8212;a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200,000 work hours&#8212;to 0.12 by fiscal 2025. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and well-being of our global employees. We have utilized our workplace flexibility guidelines, promoted our Wellbeing Connection program and health care benefits to support the needs of all employees, and instituted additional safety measures at all factories and sites. We are striving to implement a global human rights program. We have recently instituted a global human rights policy and a human trafficking and modern slavery policy. We apply high standards of human rights and require that our suppliers do the same.\n\nWe believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see &#8220;Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;\n\nGovernment Regulation and Supervision \n\nThe import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nSee Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters. Also, see &#8220;Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations.\n\nEnvironmental \n\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;WEEE&#8221;) Directives; the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (&#8220;China RoHS&#8221;) regulation; the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (&#8220;REACH&#8221;) regulation; and similar laws.\n\nCompliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2022, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $17 million to $44 million, and we accrued $20 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSustainability \n\nWe look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations. Our One Connected World strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability. \n\nOur sustainability initiatives in our operations began more than ten years ago. From fiscal 2010 to 2022, we achieved more than a 20% reduction in absolute energy usage, more than a 25% reduction in absolute water usage, and more than a 50% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). Over the last few years, we have recycled approximately 80% of the waste materials from our operations. We have challenged ourselves to find new ways to continue to drive sustainability improvements. In fiscal 2022, we:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; continued to make progress on our goal to further reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by more than 40%, from our fiscal 2020 baseline, by fiscal 2030; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; made progress towards our target to decrease water withdrawals by 15%, from our fiscal 2021 baseline, by fiscal 2025 at 30 sites with extremely high and high water stress; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; made progress towards our target to decrease hazardous waste disposed by 15%, from our fiscal 2021 baseline, by fiscal 2025; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; remained committed to sourcing renewable energy, developing and implementing energy efficiency projects, and strengthening operating standards; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; worked with key suppliers to reduce Scope 3 emissions. ##TABLE_END \n\nWhile sustainability is embedded in our operations, we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain. The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations. In addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, we help our customers produce smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient products, reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products. With every product that comes out of our facilities, we support a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future.\n\nAdditional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and progress is available in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (&#8220;TCFD&#8221;) Report located on our website at www.te.com under the heading &#8220;Corporate Responsibility.&#8221; The contents of our Corporate Responsibility Report and TCFD Report are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAvailable Information \n\nAll periodic and current reports, registration filings, and other filings that we are required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) are available free of charge through our internet website at www.te.com .

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our securities. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity . \n\nRisks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and Our Global Presence \n\nConditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems, and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. \n\nOur business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults. Any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in economic conditions, expectations for future revenue, projected future cash flows, or other factors have triggered and could trigger additional recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results. \n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) dollars; however, a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nWe are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 60% of our net sales for fiscal 2022 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Recently, the strength of the U.S. dollar has generally increased as compared to other currencies, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful.\n\nWe have suffered and could continue to suffer significant business interruptions, including impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors. \n\nOur operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, tornados, or floods; other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism, or war, including the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; disease or other adverse health developments, including impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes. In addition, such interruptions could result in a widespread crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers&#8217; products. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted and continues to impact countries, communities, workforces, supply chains, and markets around the world, and as a result, we have experienced disruptions and restrictions on our employees&#8217; ability to travel, as well as temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers, suppliers, and other vendors in our supply chain. As a result of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a full-time or part-time basis, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant, negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 and certain of our operations in China in fiscal 2022. While some of our operations in China were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our businesses globally in fiscal 2022. However, it may \n\nhave a negative impact on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will further impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include the further spread of the virus to additional persons and geographic regions; the severity of the virus; variant strains of the virus; the duration of the pandemic; resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations; the success of public health advancements, including vaccine production and distribution; the resulting impact on our suppliers&#8217; and customers&#8217; supply chains and financial positions, including their ability to pay us; the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate; and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate. Further, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans&#8217; investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets. \n\nConcerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans&#8217; investment portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans&#8217; investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nDisruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding. \n\nThe global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit. Downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions.\n\nWe are subject to global risks of political, economic, and military instability. \n\nOur workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including:\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nchanges in global trade policies, including sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nvariations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ntax law and regulatory changes in Switzerland, the U.S., the EU, and other jurisdictions, examinations by taxing authorities, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nemployment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which we currently operate;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ndifficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ninstability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia &#8217; s invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nthe impact of the United Kingdom &#8217; s withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as &#8220; Brexit &#8221; ) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers and suppliers; and\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nthe impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements.\n\n##TABLE_END We have sizeable operations in China, including 18 principal manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 were made to customers in China. Economic conditions in China have been, and may continue to be, volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China continues to evolve and is subject to change. Accordingly, our operations and transactions with customers in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions, changes to the regulatory environment, or interpretation of Chinese law.\n\nIn addition, any downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nChanges in U.S. federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to U.S. persons treated as owning 10% or more of our shares. \n\nAlthough we are a Swiss corporation, application of certain U.S. tax law ownership attribution rules may cause non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations (&#8220;CFCs&#8221;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10% or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder. A U.S. person that owns 10% or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in U.S. federal income tax law. The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.\n\nRisks Relating to the Industry in Which We Operate \n\nWe are dependent on the automotive and other industries. \n\nWe are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers&#8217; industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nApproximately 40% of our net sales for fiscal 2022 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, approximately 12% of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market, 10% of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market, and 10% of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market. Demand in the industrial equipment industry is dependent upon economic conditions, including customer investment in factory and warehouse automation, process control systems, and building automation and smart city infrastructure, as well as market conditions in the rail transportation, lighting, and other major industrial markets we serve. The commercial transportation industry is impacted by the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck, construction, agriculture, and recreational vehicle markets. Demand for data and devices can fluctuate significantly, depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for data communication, computer, and consumer electronics products. The overall market trends of increased data connectivity and continued movement to high-speed cloud applications have had a favorable impact on demand.\n\nWe encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry. \n\nWe operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new technology; our ability to participate in emerging markets; and customers&#8217; expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price, and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nWe are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue. \n\nSubstantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.\n\nLike other suppliers to the electronics industry, we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices. \n\nWe have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. Although pricing actions positively impacted our net sales in fiscal 2022, we have historically experienced price erosion averaging from 1% to 2% each year. To maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nWe may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate. \n\nMany of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, data and devices, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends may adversely affect the margins on our products, particularly for commodity components.\n\nThe life cycles of certain of our products can be very short. \n\nThe life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover, and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Operations \n\nOur results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost. \n\nWe are a large buyer of resins, chemicals, additives, and metals, including copper, gold, silver, aluminum, brass, steel, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of many of these raw materials continue to increase and fluctuations \n\nmay persist in the future. In addition, feedstock for resins and resins themselves, as well as certain other commodities, are increasingly subject to varied and unrelated force majeure events worldwide further impacting price and availability. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures. If we have difficulty obtaining raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials, it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials. To the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate.\n\nThe SEC requires annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies which use tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (&#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; or &#8220;3TG&#8221;) mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (&#8220;DRC&#8221;) and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the &#8220;Covered Countries&#8221;) in their products. These requirements, as well as new and additional regulations like the EU&#8217;s Conflict Minerals Regulation, could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of certain of our products, and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers which can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to meet customer non-conflict 3TG standards or sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures.\n\nWe may use components and products manufactured by third parties. \n\nWe may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.\n\nOur future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees. \n\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our management team. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for management talent is intense, and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation. \n\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations; compromise information belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liabilities or penalties which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Specifically, we are subject to the laws of various states and countries where we operate or do business related to solicitation, collection, processing, transferring, storing, or use of consumer, customer, vendor, or employee information or related data, including the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and China&#8217;s Personal Information Protection Law. In addition, certain countries in which we operate or do business have enacted or are considering enacting laws that impose additional data transfer restrictions. If countries in which \n\nwe operate or do business were to adopt data localization or data residency laws, we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols, build new storage facilities, and/or devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws, any of which could have significant implications to business operations and costs.\n\nIn addition to our own systems, we have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain information technology services&#8212;including cloud computing services and storage systems, system development, and information technology support services&#8212;which have in the past, and in the future may, subject our information technology and other sensitive information to additional risk. \n\nOur cybersecurity safeguards and measures are reviewed and upgraded to mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats. These measures notwithstanding, our information technology networks and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by malicious actors with significant financial and technological resources, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, pandemics, or other catastrophic events, which may require us to notify regulators, customers, or employees, and enlist identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. We continue to monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our information technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our intellectual property and our employees&#8217;, customers&#8217;, and suppliers&#8217; data. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of applicable laws could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, including attempted cyber intrusions, to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations. Some of our employees continue to work from home on a full-time or part-time basis, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks.\n\nCovenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us. \n\nOur five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes&#8217; indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets.\n\nAlthough none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder.\n\nThe indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event.\n\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate widely. \n\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including:\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nour quarterly or annual earnings;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nquarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nvolatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors &#8217; concerns about potential risks to future economic growth;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ntax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., the EU, and other jurisdictions;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business.\n\n##TABLE_END Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions \n\nFuture acquisitions may not be successful. \n\nWe regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings, and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years. We anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nFuture acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity. \n\nIf we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks, public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares.\n\nDivestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. \n\nWe continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered.\n\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Regulations \n\nOur ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology. \n\nThe electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nWe are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. \n\nIn the normal course of business, we are, from time to time, a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management&#8217;s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nIf any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer. \n\nOur operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\nWe also must comply with applicable trade regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, the issuance of which may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. Any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In this regard, we have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (&#8220;BIS&#8221;) and the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (&#8220;DDTC&#8221;). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies&#8217; investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.\n\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. \n\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government enforcement actions, and reputational risk. \n\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things:\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nthe generation, storage, use, and transportation and disposal of hazardous materials;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nemissions or discharges of substances into the environment;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ninvestigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions;\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nproduct hazardous material content; and\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nthe health and safety of our employees.\n\n##TABLE_END We may not have been, or we may not always be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements.\n\nCertain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, reporting, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, reporting, removal, and remediation costs under certain regulatory regimes, such as U.S. federal and state laws, is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notifications from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, other environmental agencies, and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerly-owned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation and/or remediation is necessary.\n\nWhile we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities.\n\nOur products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, recycling, and other circular economy initiatives. \n\nThe EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, circular economy initiatives, and other related matters. These laws include but are not limited to the EU RoHS, End-of-Life Vehicle, and WEEE Directives; the EU REACH regulation; and the China RoHS regulation. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible, could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions, and could result in liability for product recalls, penalties, or other claims.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation \n\nAs a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares. \n\nAs a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create conditional share capital of up to 50% of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. \n\nUntil recently, Swiss law provided for the option to create authorized share capital that could be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization was limited to authorized share capital up to 50% of the existing registered shares with the authorization valid for a maximum of two years. Such authorization period under our articles of association ended on March 11, 2022. As part of the Swiss corporate law reform, effective as of January 1, 2023, the concept of authorized share capital will be replaced by a capital band. Under a capital band, the articles of association may authorize the board of directors for a maximum period of five years to increase the ordinary share capital registered in the commercial register to a maximum of 150% and/or reduce it to a minimum of 50% of the share capital existing at the time of the introduction of the capital band. Our articles of association do not currently provide for a capital band.\n\nAdditionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors.\n\nWe might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. \n\nWe anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding tax. Various tax law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices.\n\nCurrency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. \n\nThe registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is denominated in Swiss francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital. If the U.S. dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease.\n\nWe have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares. \n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation&#8217;s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.\n\nRegistered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings. \n\nOur articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders&#8217; meetings, but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association.\n\nCertain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable. \n\nOur articles of association contain provisions that could be considered &#8220;anti-takeover&#8221; provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others:\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nshareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nrestrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15% or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors.\n\n##TABLE_END These provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital (in either case, representing a maximum of 50% of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital, such authorization period ended on March 11, 2022 and was not reapproved by our shareholders at our March 9, 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders) without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders&#8217; preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;), on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20% or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions.\n\nGlobal legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate and our global cash taxes. \n\nVarious legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower-tax jurisdictions. There has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as:\n\n##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( &#8220; OECD &#8221; ) and participating countries continue to work toward implementing international tax system reforms, including the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax that is expected to be effective as early as fiscal 2025,\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\nEU and other country efforts to adopt added OECD proposals and modified OECD proposals (including the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, state aid cases, and various transparency proposals), and\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#183; \n\ntax policy changes in the U.S., such as additional federal tax reform measures and new tax regulations.\n\n##TABLE_END If these proposals are adopted, they may materially increase cash taxes, increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate, cause double taxation, and increase audit risk. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us.\n\nLegislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. \n\nVarious U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions.\n\nWe expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us.\n\nSwiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. \n\nAs we are organized under the laws of Switzerland, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us, or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to Switzerland&#8217;s public policy.\n\nSwiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.\n\n"

On an organic basis, our net sales increased 12.1% in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Our net sales by segment were as follows: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Transportation Solutions &#8212;Our net sales increased 2.7% with sales increases in the automotive and commercial transportation end markets, partially offset by sales declines in the sensors end market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Industrial Solutions &#8212;Our net sales increased 17.6% primarily as a result of sales increases in the industrial equipment end market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Communications Solutions &#8212;Our net sales increased 20.8% due primarily to sales increases in the data and devices end market. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $306 million in net sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; During fiscal 2022, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $2.24 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.56 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2,468 million in fiscal 2022. ##TABLE_END \n\nEconomic Conditions \n\nOur business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. See &#8220;Russia-Ukraine Military Conflict&#8221; and &#8220;COVID-19 Pandemic&#8221; for additional information. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur business operates globally and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our results. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our net sales by $723 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. We expect translation to continue to have a negative impact on our operating results in fiscal 2023. We expect translation to negatively impact our net sales by approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 as a result of continued strength of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\n\nWe are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. As a result of inflationary pressure, we have implemented price increases for a number of our products. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221;\n\nRussia-Ukraine Military Conflict \n\nWe are monitoring the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, escalating tensions in surrounding countries, and associated sanctions. We suspended our business operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine have been reduced to focus on the safety of our employees. We have experienced increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. The increased costs and \n\nsupply chain disruptions resulting from the conflict have not been material to our business, and we have been able to partially mitigate them through price increases or productivity. Neither Russia nor Ukraine represents a material portion of our business, and the military conflict has not had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or result of operations during fiscal 2022.\n\nThe full impact of the military conflict on our business operations and financial performance remains uncertain. The extent to which the conflict may impact our business in future periods will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict, its impact on regional and global economic conditions, and supply chain disruptions. We will continue to actively monitor the conflict and assess the related sanctions and other effects and may take further actions if necessary.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic \n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) was first identified in China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns and travel restrictions in affected areas. The pandemic had a negative impact on certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 and continued to impact certain of our operations in China for a period of time in fiscal 2022. The pandemic has not had a significant impact on our ability to staff our operations, and we do not expect that it will continue to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term. Throughout our operations, we implemented additional health and safety measures for the protection of our employees, including providing personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities, and remote working arrangements.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business operations globally, causing disruption in our suppliers&#8217; and customers&#8217; supply chains, some of our business locations to reduce or suspend operations, and a reduction in demand for certain products from direct customers or end markets. In addition, the pandemic had far-reaching impacts on many additional aspects of our operations, both directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, our employees, and the market generally. \n\nThe extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the further spread of the virus, variant strains of the virus, and the resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations as well as the success of public health advancements, including vaccine production and distribution. While certain of our operations were shut down in China for a period of time in fiscal 2022, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term. However, it may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. \n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nFor further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see &#8220;Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;\n\nOutlook \n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect our net sales to be approximately $3.75 billion as compared to $3.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $1.31 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $400 million and $0.19 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2022. Also, this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.\n\nAcquisitions \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $245 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Communications Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\n\nWe acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $422 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2021. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\n\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.\n\nResults of Operations \n\nNet Sales \n\nThe following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTransportation Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n9,219 \n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n$\n\n8,974 \n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndustrial Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,520 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,844 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCommunications Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,542 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,105 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n16,281 \n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n$\n\n14,923 \n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nChange in Net Sales for Fiscal 2022 versus Fiscal 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Sales \n\n&#8203; \n\nOrganic Net Sales \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nGrowth \n\n&#8203; \n\nGrowth \n\n&#8203; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160;\n\n(Divestitures) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nTransportation Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n2.7 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n8.1 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n(482) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndustrial Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n17.6 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16.6 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(187) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nCommunications Solutions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n20.8 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n20.8 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(54) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,358 \n\n&#160;\n\n9.1 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n1,803 \n\n&#160;\n\n12.1 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n(723) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END Net sales increased $1,358 million, or 9.1%, in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 12.1% and net sales contributions of 1.9% from acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 4.9% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. In fiscal 2022, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $509 million. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed $306 million in net sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average sales figure for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. See further discussion of net sales below under &#8220;Segment Results.&#8221;\n\nNet Sales by Geographic Region. Our business operates in three geographic regions&#8212;Asia&#8211;Pacific, EMEA, and the Americas&#8212;and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2022. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2022 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCurrencies \n\n&#160;\n\nPercentage \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. dollar\n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nEuro\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nChinese renminbi\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nJapanese yen\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAll others\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END The following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAsia&#8211;Pacific\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n5,771 \n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n$\n\n5,374 \n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nEMEA\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n5,707 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n5,471 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAmericas\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,803 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,078 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n16,281 \n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n$\n\n14,923 \n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by geographic region:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nChange in Net Sales for Fiscal 2022 versus Fiscal 2021 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Sales \n\n&#8203; \n\nOrganic Net Sales \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAcquisitions \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nGrowth \n\n&#8203; \n\nGrowth \n\n&#8203; \n\nTranslation \n\n&#160;\n\n(Divestitures) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\nAsia&#8211;Pacific\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n7.4 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n10.1 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n(200) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nEMEA\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4.3 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n10.9 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(520) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAmericas\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n17.8 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16.3 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(3) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,358 \n\n&#160;\n\n9.1 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n1,803 \n\n&#160;\n\n12.1 \n\n% \n\n$\n\n(723) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END Cost of Sales and Gross Margin \n\nThe following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChange \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\nCost of sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n11,037 \n\n(1) &#8203; \n\n$\n\n10,036 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,001 \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs a percentage of net sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n67.8\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n67.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nGross margin\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n5,244 \n\n(1) &#8203; \n\n$\n\n4,887 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs a percentage of net sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n32.2\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n32.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal 2022 included an additional week. ##TABLE_END \n\nIn fiscal 2022, gross margin increased $357 million as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of higher volume and the positive impact of pricing actions, partially offset by inflationary pressure on material and operating costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.\n\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures. As a result, we have experienced shortages and price increases in some of our input materials&#8212;including copper, gold, silver, and palladium&#8212;however, we have been able to initiate pricing actions which have partially offset these impacts.

In fiscal 2022, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $72 million as compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels, the impact of inflation, and incremental expenses attributable to recent acquisitions, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation.\n\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. \n\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, we initiated restructuring programs associated with footprint consolidation and cost structure improvements across all segments. We incurred net restructuring and related charges of $153 million, of which $16 million was recorded in cost of sales, in fiscal 2022 and $208 million in fiscal 2021. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately $120 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2025. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2023, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $150 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $165 million.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.\n\nOperating Income \n\nThe following table presents operating income and operating margin information:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChange \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nOperating income\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,756 \n\n(1) &#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,434 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nOperating margin\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n16.9\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n16.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal 2022 included an additional week. ##TABLE_END \n\nOperating income included the following:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nAcquisition-related charges:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAcquisition and integration costs\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nCharges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nRestructuring and other charges, net\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nRestructuring-related charges recorded in cost of sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END See discussion of operating income below under &#8220;Segment Results.&#8221;\n\nNon-Operating Items \n\nThe following table presents select non-operating information:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChange \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n(17) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncome tax expense\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEffective tax rate\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n11.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n5.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END Other Income (Expense).

We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of &#8364;550 million of 1.10% senior notes due in March 2023. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs. \n\nAs of fiscal year end 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (&#8220;TEGSA&#8221;), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2022, we had approximately $7.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\nNet cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased $208 million to $2,468 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to $2,676 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease resulted primarily from the impact of increased working capital \n\nlevels, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2022 and 2021 was $421 million and $371 million, respectively.\n\nPension contributions were $42 million and $61 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be $43 million in fiscal 2023, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. For additional information regarding pensions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \n\nCapital expenditures were $768 million and $690 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect fiscal 2023 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $245 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $422 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2021. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization \n\nTotal debt at fiscal year end 2022 and 2021 was $4,206 million and $4,092 million, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, TEGSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior notes due in February 2032. The notes are TEGSA&#8217;s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.\n\nTEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of $1.5 billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2022 or 2021.\n\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the term secured overnight financing rate (&#8220;Term SOFR&#8221;) (as defined in the Credit Facility), (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.&#8217;s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1%, and (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, (3) an alternative currency daily rate, or (4) an alternative currency term rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders&#8217; commitments under the Credit Facility.\n\nThe Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2022, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.\n\nPeriodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. At fiscal year end 2022, TEGSA had $370 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.45%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at fiscal year end 2021.\n\nTEGSA&#8217;s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nPayments of common share dividends to shareholders were $685 million and $647 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares.\n\nIn March 2022, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $2.24 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.56 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nFuture dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in our share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately ten million of our common shares for $1,409 million and approximately seven million of our common shares for $904 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. At fiscal year end 2022, we had $1.7 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\n\nSummarized Guarantor Financial Information \n\nAs discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA&#8217;s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries. The following tables present summarized financial information, excluding investments in and equity in earnings of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, for TE Connectivity Ltd. and TEGSA on a combined basis.\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal Year End \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nBalance Sheet Data: \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal current assets\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,400 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal noncurrent assets (1) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,769 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,829 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,937 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,144 \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal noncurrent liabilities (2) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n15,871 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n12,443 \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Includes $2,601 million and $1,810 million as of fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, respectively, of intercompany loans receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Includes $12,582 million and $8,832 million as of fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, respectively, of intercompany loans payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries. ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nStatement of Operations Data: \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nLoss from continuing operations\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n(35) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n(486) \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet loss\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(35) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(479) \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2023 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nIn disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for \n\ninvestigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $127 million, excluding those related to our former Subsea Communications (&#8220;SubCom&#8221;) business which are discussed below.\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business&#8217; projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately $115 million as of fiscal year end 2022 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2027. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCommitments and Contingencies \n\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2022:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nPayments Due \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nIn Fiscal 2023 \n\n&#160;\n\nThereafter \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\nLong-term debt:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nPrincipal payments (1) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n3,330 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n4,244 \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest payments on debt (2) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nOperating leases (3) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nPurchase obligations (4) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,150 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,189 \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal contractual cash obligations (5)(6) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,283 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n4,423 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n6,706 \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Interest payments exclude the impact of interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts.

We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $43 million to pension plans in fiscal 2023, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments. ##TABLE_END \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nTrade Compliance Matters \n\nWe have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (&#8220;BIS&#8221;) and the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (&#8220;DDTC&#8221;). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies&#8217; investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management&#8217;s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.\n\nWe generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.\n\nAlthough products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other .\n\nIntangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and \n\nunpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.\n\nWe test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a &#8220;component&#8221;) if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2022, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.\n\nGoodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management&#8217;s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.\n\nWhen testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nFair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and determined that no impairment existed.\n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIn determining pre-tax income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\n\nWe currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.\n\nChanges in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nPension Plans \n\nOur defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustees of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.\n\nNet periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants.\n\nTwo critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are discount rates and expected long-term returns on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. Discount rates represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and are used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in discount rates increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2022, a 25-basis-point decrease in discount rates would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $64 million; a 25-basis-point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $61 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. A 50-basis-point decrease or increase in the expected long-term returns on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2022 pension expense by $11 million.\n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans&#8217; master trust is 25% return-seeking assets and 75% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 110%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2022, our target asset allocation is 67% return-seeking and 33% liability-hedging.\n\nAccounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure \n\nOrganic Net Sales Growth \n\nWe present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management&#8217;s control, such as the impact of changes in \n\nforeign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.\n\nOrganic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Segment Results&#8221; provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOrganic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.\n\nForward-Looking Information \n\nCertain statements in this Annual Report are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nIn the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks.\n\nWe do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty.\n\nForeign Currency Exposures \n\nAs part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. In addition, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2022 market rates would have changed the unrealized \n\nvalue of our contracts by $151 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2021 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by $240 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.\n\nInterest Rate and Investment Exposures \n\nWe issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. There were no such contracts and no floating rate debt outstanding at fiscal year end 2022 or 2021.\n\nWe may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. At fiscal year end 2021, we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional value of $450 million and were designated as cash flow hedges. There were no forward starting interest rate swap contracts at fiscal year end 2022.\n\nWe utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities.\n\nCommodity Exposures \n\nOur worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At fiscal year end 2022, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, copper, and palladium, were in a net loss position of $82 million and had a notional value of $566 million. At fiscal year end 2021, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, copper, and palladium, were in a net gain position of $1 million and had a notional value of $512 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2022 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $48 million. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2021 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by $51 million.\n\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding financial instruments.\n\n&#8203; \n\n"

Based on this evaluation, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n\nDeloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, which is included in this Annual Report.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and September 24, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 15, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#39;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#39;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nIncome Taxes &#8212; Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets &#8212; Refer to Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company recognizes deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to expiration. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to \n\nrealize a portion of its deferred tax assets, and therefore, a valuation allowance of $7.1 billion has been recorded to offset the Company&#8217;s gross deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022 of $9.8 billion.\n\nWe identified the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the Company&#8217;s tax structure and the significant judgments and estimates made by management to determine that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future prior to expiration to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies and the reasonableness of management&#8217;s estimates of taxable income prior to expiration.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred tax assets included the following, among others:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s estimates of the realization of the deferred tax assets, including those over the estimates of taxable income, the approval of tax planning strategies and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized prior to expiration. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of management&#8217;s assessment of the significance and weighting of negative evidence and positive evidence that is objectively verifiable. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; We evaluated management&#8217;s ability to accurately estimate taxable income by comparing actual results to management&#8217;s historical estimates and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would impact management&#8217;s ability to continue accurately estimating taxable income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; We tested the reasonableness of management&#8217;s estimates of taxable income by comparing the estimates to: ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8211; Historical taxable income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8211; Internal communications to management and the board of directors. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8211; Management&#8217;s history of carrying out its stated plans and its ability to carry out its plans considering contractual commitments, available financing, or debt covenants. ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; We evaluated whether the estimates of future taxable income were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; We evaluated whether the taxable income in prior carryback years was of the appropriate character and available under the tax law. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated (1) the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies, including that they were prudent, feasible and would more likely than not result in the realization of deferred tax assets and (2) management&#8217;s assessment that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets prior to expiration. ##TABLE_END \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania \n\nNovember 15, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2007.\n\n&#8203; \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated November 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38;

The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included on the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which is a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations. See Note 20 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.\n\nWe generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.\n\nAlthough products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.\n\nInventories \n\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out cost method.\n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment, Net \n\nProperty, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 10 to 20 years for land improvements, 5 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, and 1 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.\n\nWe periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on several factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other . \n\nIntangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.\n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.\n\nGoodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management&#8217;s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.\n\nWhen testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nFair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.\n\nResearch and Development \n\nResearch and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in research, development, and engineering expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $ 610 million, $ 612 million, and $ 539 million, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes . Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest.\n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial instruments.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe account for derivative financial instrument contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. For instruments not designated as hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , the changes in the instruments&#8217; fair value are \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nrecognized currently in earnings. For instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Amounts excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized currently in earnings. Changes in the fair value of instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged, with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized currently in earnings.\n\nWe determine the fair value of our financial instruments using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. Standard market conventions are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments, including derivatives.\n\nThe cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nOur derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks. Concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated, however, by our use of financial institutions worldwide, substantially all of which have long-term S&#38;P, Moody&#8217;s, and/or Fitch credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, we utilize only conventional derivative financial instruments. We are exposed to potential losses if a counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of its agreement. With respect to counterparty net asset positions recognized at fiscal year end 2022, we have assessed the likelihood of counterparty default as remote. We currently provide guarantees from a wholly-owned subsidiary to the counterparties to our commodity swap derivatives and, prior to maturity, exchanged cash collateral with the counterparties to certain of our cross-currency swap contracts. The likelihood of performance on the guarantees has been assessed as remote. For all other derivative financial instruments, we are not required to provide, nor do we require counterparties to provide, collateral or other security. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observable inputs utilized in valuation of certain assets and liabilities. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 1&#8212; Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 2&#8212; Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 3&#8212; Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flows methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_END \n\nDerivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are generally valued using level 2 inputs.\n\nFinancial instruments other than derivative instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. These instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at book value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, we believe book value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 10 for disclosure of the fair value of debt. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial instruments:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Cash and cash equivalents&#8212; Cash and cash equivalents are valued at book value, which we consider to be equivalent to unadjusted quoted prices (level 1). ##TABLE_END \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Accounts receivable&#8212; Accounts receivable are valued based on the net value expected to be realized. The net realizable value generally represents an observable contractual agreement (level 2). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Accounts payable&#8212; Accounts payable are valued based on the net value expected to be paid, generally supported by an observable contractual agreement (level 2). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Debt&#8212; The fair value of debt, including both current and non-current maturities, is derived from quoted market prices or other pricing determinations based on the results of market approach valuation models using observable market data such as recently reported trades, bid and offer information, and benchmark securities (level 2). ##TABLE_END \n\nPension Plans \n\nThe funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustees of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.\n\nNet periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants.\n\nThe measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions determined by our management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age, and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, rates of compensation increases, interest crediting rates, and mortality rates.\n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nWe determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant. Share options are valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model; restricted share awards and performance awards are valued using our end-of-day share price on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. Estimates regarding the attainment of performance criteria are reviewed periodically; the cumulative impact of a change in estimate regarding the attainment of performance criteria is recorded in the period in which that change is made. \n\nEarnings Per Share \n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements.\n\nLeases \n\nWe account for leases in accordance with of ASC 842, Leases . We have facility, land, vehicle, and equipment leases that expire at various dates. We determine if a contract qualifies as a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset. \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nLease right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. Lease ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. We do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases. Since our lease contracts do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, we determine a fully-collateralized incremental borrowing rate that reflects a similar term to the lease and the economic environment of the applicable country or region in which the asset is leased. \n\nWe have elected to account for fixed lease and non-lease components in our real estate leases as a single lease component; other leases generally do not contain non-lease components. The non-lease components in our real estate leases include logistics services, warehousing, and other operational costs. Many of these costs are variable, fluctuating based on services provided, such as pallets shipped in and out of a location or square footage of space occupied. These costs, and any other variable rental costs, are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Some of our leases may include options to either renew or early terminate the lease. The exercise of these options is generally at our sole discretion and would only occur if there is an economic, financial, or business reason to do so. Such options are included in the lease term if we determine it is reasonably certain they will be exercised.\n\nCurrency Translation \n\nFor our non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using fiscal year end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.\n\nRestructuring Charges \n\nRestructuring activities involve employee-related termination costs, facility exit costs, and asset impairments resulting from reductions-in-force, migration of facilities or product lines from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, or consolidation of facilities within countries. We recognize termination costs based on requirements established by severance policy, government law, or previous actions. Facility exit costs generally reflect the accelerated rent expense for ROU assets, expected lease termination costs, or costs that will continue to be incurred under the facility lease without future economic benefit to us. Restructuring activities often result in the disposal or abandonment of assets that require an acceleration of depreciation or impairment reflecting the excess of the assets&#8217; carrying values over fair value.\n\nThe recognition of restructuring costs require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity. To the extent our actual results differ from our estimates and assumptions, we may be required to revise the estimated liabilities, requiring the recognition of additional restructuring costs or the reduction of liabilities already recognized. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure these balances are properly stated and the utilization of the reserves are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans.\n\nContingent Liabilities \n\nWe record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided.\n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-04 to enhance transparency and introduce new disclosures related to a buyer&#8217;s use of supplier finance programs. This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting the update, but do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n3.

Acquisitions \n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $ 245 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Communications Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\n\nWe acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $ 422 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2021. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. In fiscal 2021, due to the timing of two transactions that closed in the fourth quarter, we preliminarily allocated the purchase price of those acquisitions to goodwill and identifiable intangibles assets. During fiscal 2022, we finalized the purchase price allocation, which included the recognition of $ 25 million of cash acquired, and the associated goodwill was reduced. See Note 7 for additional information. \n\nDuring fiscal 2020, we acquired five businesses, including First Sensor AG (&#8220;First Sensor&#8221;), for a combined cash purchase price of $ 336 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments from the date of acquisition.\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of approximately 72 % of the outstanding shares of First Sensor, we and First Sensor entered into a Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement (&#8220;DPLTA&#8221;) which became effective in fiscal 2020. Under the terms of the DPLTA, First Sensor minority shareholders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor minority shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of &#8364; 0.56 per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of &#8364; 33.27 per First Sensor share. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the DPLTA is uncertain. Our First Sensor noncontrolling interest balance, which was originally recorded at a fair value of &#8364; 96 million at the acquisition date (equivalent to $ 107 million), is recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of fiscal year end 2022 and 2021 as the exercise of the put right by First Sensor minority shareholders is not within our control.\n\n5.

We determined the fair value of the Sensors reporting unit to be $ 1.0 billion as of March 27, 2020. This valuation was based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance, which we consider to be a level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy, and was corroborated using a market approach valuation. The goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value by $ 900 million.

(&#8220;TEGSA&#8221;), our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $ 600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50 % senior notes due in February 2032. The notes are TEGSA&#8217;s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.\n\nTEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of $ 1.5 billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $ 500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2022 or 2021.\n\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the term secured overnight financing rate (&#8220;Term SOFR&#8221;) (as defined in the Credit Facility), (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America , N.A.&#8217;s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1%, and (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1 %, (3) an alternative currency daily rate , or (4) an alternative currency term rate , plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders&#8217; commitments under the Credit Facility.\n\nThe Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants.\n\nPeriodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nTEGSA&#8217;s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.\n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, principal payments required for debt are as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal 2024\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal 2025\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal 2026\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal 2027\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nThereafter\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,686 \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n4,244 \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $ 3,990 million and $ 4,465 million at fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n11.

Commitments and Contingencies \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nTrade Compliance Matters \n\nWe have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (&#8220;BIS&#8221;) and the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (&#8220;DDTC&#8221;). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies&#8217; investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved.\n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nWe are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2022, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $ 17 million to $ 44 million, and we accrued $ 20 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nGuarantees \n\nIn disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $ 127 million, excluding those related to our former Subsea Communications (&#8220;SubCom&#8221;) business which are discussed below.\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business&#8217; projects that existed as of the date of sale. These performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately $ 115 million as of fiscal year end 2022 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2027. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.\n\n13. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements \n\nWe use derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, investment, and commodity risks.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\nAs part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months .\n\nDuring fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which were designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. The aggregate notional value of these contracts was &#8364; 700 million at fiscal year end 2021. During fiscal 2022, certain contracts were terminated and the remaining contracts matured. Under the terms of the contracts that matured in fiscal 2022, we made interest payments in euros at 3.50 % per annum and received interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.26 % per annum. Upon maturity, we paid the notional value of the remaining contracts in euros and received U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract were required to provide cash collateral. As of fiscal year end 2022, all collateral positions related to these cross-currency swap contracts were settled.\n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nAt fiscal year end 2021, these cross-currency swap contracts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows; there were no such balances at fiscal year end 2022:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal Year End \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160;\n\nOther liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nAt fiscal year end 2021, collateral received from or paid to our counterparties approximated the net derivative position.

The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $ 1,658 million and $ 3,798 million at fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nWe also use a cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was $ 1,873 million and $ 1,430 million at fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, respectively. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 1.57 % per annum and pay no interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2026, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.

As a result of this transaction, we recognized a settlement charge of $ 28 million , which was recorded in net other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nIn fiscal 2022 , unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of higher discount rates, partially offset by unfavorable asset performance, for our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2021 . In fiscal 2021, unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of favorable asset performance and higher discount rates for our non-U.S. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2020.\n\nIn determining the expected returns on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations.\n\nThe investment strategies for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management.\n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans&#8217; master trust is 25 % return-seeking assets and 75 % liability-hedging assets. Return-seeking assets, including non-U.S. and U.S. equity securities, are assets intended to generate returns in excess of pension liability growth. Liability-hedging assets, including government and corporate bonds, are assets intended to have characteristics similar to pension liabilities and are used to better match asset cash flows with expected obligation cash flows. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 110 %. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2022, our target asset allocation is 67 % return-seeking and 33 % liability-hedging.\n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nTarget weighted-average asset allocation and weighted-average asset allocation for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans were as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNon-U.S. Plans \n\n&#8203; \n\nU.S. Plans \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear End \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear End \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear End \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear End \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nTarget \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTarget \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\nAsset category:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEquity securities\n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nFixed income\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n% \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nOur common shares are not a direct investment of our pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include our shares.

Fair value is calculated as the closing price of the underlying investments, an observable market condition, divided by the number of shares of the fund outstanding. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Other investments are composed of insurance contracts, derivatives, short-term investments, structured products such as collateralized obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed securities, real estate investments, and hedge funds. Insurance contracts are valued using cash surrender value, or face value of the contract if a cash surrender value is unavailable (level 2), as these values represent the amount that the plan would receive on termination of the underlying contract. Derivatives, short-term investments, and structured products are marked to fair value using models that are supported by observable market-based data (level 2). Real estate investments include investments in commingled real estate funds and are valued at net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3). Hedge funds are valued at their net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) Items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include certain investments containing no significant redemption restrictions that were measured at net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) using the NAV practical expedient available in ASC 820 and amounts receivable or payable for unsettled transactions and cash balances, both of which are considered to be carried at book value. ##TABLE_END \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plans \n\nWe maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants&#8217; compensation and was $ 59 million, $ 60 million, and $ 60 million for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\nDeferred Compensation Plans \n\nWe maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record-keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to several funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. At fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, total deferred compensation liabilities were $ 206 million and $ 263 million, respectively, and were recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities.\n\nPostretirement Benefit Plans \n\nIn addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from the date of retirement to age 65 or lifetime, as applicable. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $ 13 million and $ 16 million at fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the underfunded status of the postretirement benefit plans was included primarily in long-term pension and postretirement liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, the income tax expense for fiscal 2022 included $ 27 million of income tax expense related to the write-down of certain deferred tax assets to the lower corporate tax rate enacted in the canton of Schaffhausen and $ 12 million of income tax expense related to an income tax audit of an acquired entity. As we are entitled to indemnification of pre-acquisition period tax obligations under the terms of the purchase agreement, we recorded an associated indemnification receivable and other income of $ 11 million during fiscal 2022.\n\nThe income tax expense for fiscal 2021 included a $ 353 million income tax benefit related to changes in valuation allowances, of which $ 327 million related to the net reduction in valuation allowances associated primarily with certain tax planning actions as well as improved current and expected future operating profit and taxable income. In addition, the income tax expense for fiscal 2021 included a $ 29 million income tax benefit related to an Internal Revenue Service approved change in the tax method of depreciating or amortizing certain assets and $ 23 million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of an intercompany transaction.\n\nThe income tax expense for fiscal 2020 included $ 355 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of certain measures of the Switzerland Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (&#8220;Swiss Tax Reform&#8221;) and an income tax benefit of $ 31 million related to pre-separation tax matters and the termination of the Tax Sharing Agreement. See &#8220;Swiss Tax Reform&#8221; and &#8220;Tax Sharing Agreement&#8221; below for additional information. In addition, the income tax expense for fiscal 2020 included $ 226 million of income tax expense related to increases to the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, related primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic and its negative impact on our current and expected operating profit and taxable income, we believed it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $ 900 million recorded during fiscal 2020 resulted in a tax benefit of $ 4 million as the associated goodwill was primarily not deductible for income tax purposes. See Note 7 for additional information regarding the impairment of goodwill.\n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities \n\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

During fiscal 2022, the valuation allowance increased primarily as a result of \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\n$ 4,464 million (tax effected) net write-downs of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions, with a corresponding increase to tax loss and credit carryforwards. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWe have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries&#8217; earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of fiscal year end 2022, certain subsidiaries had approximately $ 33.6 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of fiscal year end 2022, we had approximately $ 7.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#8203; \n\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nAdditions for tax positions related to prior years\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nReductions for tax positions related to prior years\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 17 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 77 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 87 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nCurrent year acquisitions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\nSettlements\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 2 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 9 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 12 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nReductions due to lapse of applicable statutes of limitations\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 100 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 37 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 97 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nBalance at end of fiscal year\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate were $ 272 million, $ 378 million, and $ 393 million at fiscal year end 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense (benefit). As of fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, we had $ 54 million and $ 53 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized income tax expense of $ 3 million, expense of $ 12 million, and benefits of $ 1 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nWe file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 4 years .

Swiss Tax Reform eliminated certain preferential tax items and implemented new tax rates at both the federal and cantonal levels. \n\nThe federal provisions of Swiss Tax Reform were enacted into law in fiscal 2019 and became effective in January 2020. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, the federal tax authority issued guidance abolishing certain interest deductions which became effective in January 2020. \n\nIn October 2019, the canton of Schaffhausen enacted Swiss Tax Reform into law, including reductions in tax rates. Consequently, during fiscal 2020, we recognized $ 355 million of income tax expense related primarily to cantonal implementation and the resulting write-down of certain deferred tax assets to the lower tax rates. \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nTax Sharing Agreement \n\nUpon our separation from Tyco International plc in fiscal 2007, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International plc (now part of Johnson Controls International plc) and Covidien plc (now part of Medtronic plc) under which we shared certain income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, we, Johnson Controls International plc, and Medtronic plc entered into an agreement to terminate the Tax Sharing Agreement. We believe that substantially all income tax matters that may be subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement have been settled with tax authorities and we do not expect any remaining tax matters to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Accordingly, during fiscal 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $ 31 million and net other income of $ 8 million representing settlement of the remaining shared pre-separation income tax matters and indemnification balances.\n\n16.

Shareholders&#8217; Equity \n\nCommon Shares \n\nWe are organized under the laws of Switzerland. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. The par value of our common shares is stated in Swiss francs (&#8220;CHF&#8221;); however, we use the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nSubject to certain conditions specified in our articles of association, we are authorized to increase our conditional share capital by issuing new shares in aggregate not exceeding 50 % of our authorized shares. Until recently, Swiss law provided for the option to create authorized share capital that could be issued by the board of directors, but this authorization was limited to authorized share capital up to 50 % of the existing registered shares with the authorization valid for a maximum of two years . Such authorization period under our articles of association ended on March 11, 2022. As part of the Swiss corporate law reform, effective as of January 1, 2023, the concept of authorized share capital will be replaced by a capital \n\nTE CONNECTIVITY LTD. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) \n\nband. Under a capital band, the articles of association may authorize the board of directors for a maximum period of five years to increase the ordinary share capital registered in the commercial register to a maximum of 150 % and/or reduce it to a minimum of 50 % of the share capital existing at the time of the introduction of the capital band. Our articles of association do not currently provide for a capital band.\n\nCommon Shares Held in Treasury \n\nAt fiscal year end 2022, approximately 13 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 5 million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. At fiscal year end 2021, approximately 9 million common shares were held in treasury, of which 4 million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. Shares held both directly by us and by our subsidiary are presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 5 million, 3 million, and 12 million shares, respectively, purchased under our share repurchase program. These capital reductions by cancellation of shares were subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register in Switzerland.\n\nContributed Surplus \n\nAs a result of cumulative equity transactions, including dividend activity and treasury share cancellations, our contributed surplus balance was reduced to zero with residual activity recorded against accumulated earnings as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders&#8217; Equity. To the extent that the contributed surplus balance continues to be zero, the impact of future transactions that normally would have been recorded as a reduction of contributed surplus will be recorded in accumulated earnings. Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes (&#8220;Swiss Contributed Surplus&#8221;) is not impacted by our GAAP treatment.\n\nSwiss Contributed Surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. As of fiscal year end 2022 and 2021, Swiss Contributed Surplus was CHF 4,239 million and CHF 4,902 million, respectively (equivalent to $ 3,191 million and $ 3,905 million, respectively).\n\nDividends \n\nWe paid cash dividends to shareholders of $ 2.12 , $ 1.96 , and $ 1.88 per share in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\nUnder Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, dividends paid from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax.

Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. All restrictions on an award will lapse upon death or disability of the employee. If the employee satisfies retirement requirements, all or a portion of the award may vest, depending on the terms and conditions of the particular grant. Recipients of restricted share units have no voting rights, but do receive dividend equivalents. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the closing value of our shares on the grant date.

Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. We employ our historical share volatility when calculating the grant-date fair value of our share option grants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Currently, we do not have exchange-traded options of sufficient duration to employ an implied volatility assumption in the calculation and therefore rely solely on the historical volatility calculation. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximated the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on our expected dividend rate. The recognized share-based compensation expense was net of estimated forfeitures, which are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.\n\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted and the weighted-average assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model were as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nFiscal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n37.51 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n22.21 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n15.49 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAssumptions:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nExpected share price volatility\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nRisk-free interest rate\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n0.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n1.7 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\nExpected annual dividend per share\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2.00 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1.92 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1.84 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nExpected life of options (in years)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5.1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5.4 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5.1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n20.
