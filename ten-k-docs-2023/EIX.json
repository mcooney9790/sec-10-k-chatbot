      "text": " RISK FACTORS\n\nRISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONAL\n\nEdison International&#39;s liquidity and ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to borrow funds, access to bank and capital markets, monetization of tax benefits held by Edison International, and SCE&#39;s ability to pay dividends and tax allocation payments to Edison International. Edison International is a holding company and, as such, it has no material operations of its own. Edison International&#39;s ability to meet its financial obligations, make investments, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of SCE and SCE&#39;s ability to make upstream distributions. If SCE does not make upstream distributions to Edison International and Edison International is unable to access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, Edison International may be unable to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its financial obligations.\n\nPrior to paying dividends to Edison International, SCE has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preference stock dividends. Further, SCE and Edison International cannot pay dividends if California law requirements for the declaration of dividends are not met. For information on CPUC and California law requirements related to the declaration of dividends, see &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;SCE Dividends&#34; in the MD&#38;A. SCE may also owe tax-allocation payments to Edison International under applicable tax-allocation agreements.\n\nEdison International&#39;s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including its levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. In addition, the factors affecting SCE&#39;s business will impact Edison International&#39;s ability to obtain financing. Edison International&#39;s inability to borrow funds from time to time could have a material effect on Edison International&#39;s liquidity and operations.\n\nSee &#34;Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company&#34; below for further discussion.\n\nRISKS RELATING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY\n\nRegulatory and Legislative Risks\n\nSCE&#39;s financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs and to earn a reasonable rate of return on capital investments in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates. \n\nSCE&#39;s ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover its costs from its customers, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and FERC. SCE&#39;s financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and \n\nequity. SCE&#39;s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers&#39; rates and differences between the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the amount of actual costs incurred. \n\nThe CPUC or the FERC may not allow SCE to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Further, SCE may incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, SCE has incurred, and expects to further incur, wildfire mitigation expenses and increased labor and material costs due to supply chain constraints and elevated levels of inflation before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable from customers. Also, the CPUC may deny recovery of costs incurred by SCE, including uninsured wildfire-related costs, if the CPUC determines that SCE was not prudent. For further information on recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs, including costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, see &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires&#8212;Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs&#34; and &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides&#34; in the MD&#38;A. In addition, while SCE supports California&#39;s environmental goals, it may be prevented from fully executing on its strategy to support such goals by regulatory delay or lack of approval of cost-recovery for the costs of such strategic actions and electrification programs from the relevant regulatory agencies.\n\nSCE&#39;s authorized return on investment is established by multiplying an authorized rate of return, determined by the CPUC in standalone cost of capital proceedings, by SCE&#39;s authorized CPUC rate base. SCE&#39;s CPUC-authorized cost of capital is subject to potential adjustment should interest rates move substantially in years between cost of capital proceedings. For further information on the cost of capital mechanism see &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Cost of Capital Applications&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nSCE&#39;s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, inflation, commodity price volatility, increasing self-generation, load departures to CCAs or Electric Service Providers, and increasing environmental regulations, among other things, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. If customer rates continue to increase, the CPUC may face greater pressure to approve lesser amounts in SCE&#8217;s ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues or increase the period over which SCE is allowed to recover amounts, which could impact SCE&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs. For example, in track 3 of the 2021 GRC, while the CPUC authorized SCE to recover costs through electric rates over a 36-month period, SCE may not recover all of its interest expense incurred as a result of financing such costs because the CPUC has only authorized interest accruals on the balances at a short-term rate of interest. If SCE is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or modify its rate design to recover its costs and an adequate return on capital in rates in a timely manner, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\n\nSCE is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory and legislative decisions, delays in regulatory or legislative decisions, and changes in applicable regulations or legislation. \n\nSCE operates in a highly regulated environment. SCE&#39;s business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. Among other things, the CPUC regulates SCE&#39;s retail rates and capital structure, and the FERC regulates SCE&#39;s wholesale rates and capital structure. The NRC regulates the decommissioning of San Onofre in addition to the local and state agencies that require permits. The construction, planning, siting and operation of SCE&#39;s power plants, energy storage projects, and transmission lines in California are also subject to regulation by the CPUC and other local, state and federal agencies.\n\nSCE must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities, including environmental regulatory authorities, and must abide by their respective rules, regulations and orders. Should SCE be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement \n\nactions or impose fines, penalties or disallowances on SCE, SCE may be prevented from executing its strategy and its business could be materially affected. The process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by opponents and such delay or defeat could have a material effect on SCE&#39;s business.\n\nTo the extent the Wildfire Insurance Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 do not effectively mitigate the significant risk faced by California investor-owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are a substantial cause, not achieving a more comprehensive solution could have a detrimental effect on SCE&#39;s business and financial condition. The effectiveness of AB 1054 to mitigate the wildfire-related risk faced by SCE is conditioned in part on the performance of OEIS and various entities formed under AB 1054 and related legislation to, among other things, administer the Wildfire Insurance Fund, approve WMPs, issue safety certifications, oversee and enforce compliance with wildfire safety standards, and develop metrics to reduce risk and measure compliance with risk reduction. In addition, CPUC approval is required to recover the costs SCE is incurring to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts described in SCE&#39;s WMPs. See &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires&#34; and &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Regulatory Proceedings&#8212;Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nIn addition, existing regulations may be revised or re-interpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to SCE, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE&#39;s business or result in significant additional costs. In addition, regulations adopted via the public initiative or legislative process may apply to SCE, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on SCE&#39;s business or result in significant additional costs.\n\nSCE&#39;s energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could materially affect its financial condition and liquidity. \n\nSCE obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants and through contracts with energy producers and sellers. California law and CPUC decisions allow SCE to recover, through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan. Nonetheless, SCE&#39;s cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes in commodity prices, including as a result of gas supply constraints. Additionally, significant and prolonged gas use restrictions may adversely impact the reliability of the electric grid if critical generation resources are limited in their operations. For further information, see &#34;Business&#8212;SCE&#8212;Purchased Power and Fuel Supply.&#34; SCE is also subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely CPUC decisions about the compliance with SCE&#39;s procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs.\n\nSCE may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could materially affect SCE&#39;s liquidity and results of operations, see &#34;Market Risk Exposures&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nOperating Risks\n\nDamage claims against SCE for wildfire-related losses may materially affect SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations. \n\nProlonged drought conditions and shifting weather patterns in California resulting from climate change as well as, among other things, buildup of dry vegetation in areas severely impacted by years of historic drought and lack of adequate clearing of hazardous fuels by responsible parties have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the risk of severe wildfire events.\n\nSevere wildfires and increased urban development in high fire risk areas in California have given rise to large damage claims against California utilities for fire-related losses alleged to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of \n\nelectric and other utility equipment. Catastrophic wildfires can occur in SCE&#39;s service territory even if SCE effectively implements its WMPs. California courts have previously found utilities to be strictly liable for property damage, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility&#39;s facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. The rationale generally stated by these courts for applying this theory to investor-owned utilities is that property losses resulting from a public improvement, such as the distribution of electricity, can be spread across the larger community that benefited from such improvement. However, in November 2017, the CPUC issued a decision denying an investor-owned utility&#39;s request to include in its rates uninsured wildfire-related costs arising from several 2007 fires, finding that the investor-owned utility did not prudently manage and operate its facilities prior to or at the outset of the 2007 wildfires. An inability to recover uninsured wildfire-related costs could materially affect SCE&#39;s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if SCE is unable to, or believes that it may be unable to, recover damages related to catastrophic wildfires through insurance, the Wildfire Insurance Fund (which is only available for fires ignited after July 12, 2019) or electric rates, or access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, SCE may not have sufficient cash or equity to pay dividends or may be restricted from declaring such dividends because it does not meet CPUC or California law requirements related to the declaration of dividends. For information on the California law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;SCE Dividends&#34; in the MD&#38;A. Also see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides.&#34;\n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s costs of accessing capital markets has increased due to the risks associated with wildfires in Southern California. Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s access to the bank and capital markets could also be constrained and/or the costs of accessing those markets could increase further as a result of wildfire risk, including if Edison International&#39;s and/or SCE&#39;s credit ratings are downgraded or placed on negative watch due to concerns about Edison International and/or SCE&#39;s financial health as a result of wildfires.\n\nSCE&#39;s insurance coverage for wildfires may not be sufficient. \n\nEdison International has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise in connection with SCE&#39;s ordinary operations. Edison International, SCE and its contractors may experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that losses will not exceed the limits of SCE&#39;s or its contractors&#39; insurance coverage. SCE may not be able to recover uninsured losses (including amounts paid for self-insured retention and co-insurance) and increases in the cost of insurance in electric rates. Losses which are not fully insured or cannot be recovered through the Wildfire Insurance Fund or electric rates could materially affect Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations. For more information on wildfire insurance risk, see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides.&#34;\n\nSCE may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation plans.\n\nSCE will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service territory if it cannot effectively implement its WMPs. For example, SCE may not be able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, and retaining effectively trained contract workers or procuring materials it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. In addition, if SCE does not have an approved WMP, SCE will not be issued a safety certification from the CPUC and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of prudency or the AB 1054 Liability Cap.\n\nThe CPUC may assess penalties on SCE if it finds that SCE has failed to substantially comply with its WMP. In addition, SCE may be subject to mandated changes to, or restrictions on, its operational wildfire mitigation practices or be subject to regulatory fines and penalties or claims for damages and reputational harm if SCE does not execute its wildfire mitigation practices in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. SCE&#8217;s wildfire mitigation practices \n\ninclude PSPS and using fast-curve settings. In addition, SCE may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties or claims for damages and reputational harm if it is determined that SCE has placed excessive or unreasonable reliance on PSPS.\n\nSCE establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent SCE&#39;s criteria for implementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires during high wind events, SCE does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due to other overriding conditions or SCE&#39;s regulators or others mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, SCE will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high wind events. Similarly, if SCE is prohibited from implementing its desired fast-curve settings, SCE will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory.\n\nFor more information on AB 1054, see &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires&#8212;Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs&#8212;2019 Wildfire Legislation.&#34;\n\nSCE will not benefit from all of the features of AB 1054 if the Wildfire Insurance Fund is exhausted. \n\nCatastrophic wildfires could rapidly exhaust the Wildfire Insurance Fund and SCE will not be reimbursed by the Wildfire Insurance Fund or benefit from the AB 1054 Liability Cap if the fund has been exhausted as a result of damage claims previously incurred by SCE or the other participating utilities.\n\nFor more information on AB 1054, see &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides&#8212;Recovery of Wildfire-Related Costs&#8212;2019 Wildfire Legislation.&#34;\n\nClimate change exacerbated weather-related incidents and other natural disasters could materially affect SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWeather-related incidents, including storms and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires, flooding and debris flows, and other natural disasters such as earthquakes can disrupt the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver power to SCE&#39;s customers. The impacts of climate change continue to evolve and remain dynamic and unpredictable. \n\nClimate change has caused, and exacerbated, extreme weather events and wildfires in southern California, and wildfires could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. In addition, the risk of flooding and debris flows occurring as a result of rain may be heightened. For example, the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events resulted in, among other things, loss of life, property damage and loss of service. For more information on the impact of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events on SCE and Edison International, see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides.&#34;\n\nExtreme heat events can lead to prolonged widespread outages due to, among other things, state-wide capacity supply shortages or equipment failure. Extreme weather events can also lead to use of PSPS. Weather-related events, such as debris flows, flooding and melting of a significantly higher than normal snowpack, and earthquakes can cause over-topping or failure at an SCE dam resulting in a rapid release of water that could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues.\n\nWeather-related incidents and other natural disasters can lead to lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance and repair costs, which SCE may not be able to recover from its customers. These incidents can also result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if SCE encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if fire-related losses are found to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of electric and other utility equipment. In addition, these occurrences could lead to significant claims for damages, including for loss of life and property damage. These occurrences could materially affect SCE&#39;s business, financial condition and results of \n\noperations, and the inability to restore power to SCE&#39;s customers could also materially damage the business reputation of SCE and Edison International.\n\nFor additional information related to climate related risks, see &#8220;Business&#8212;Environmental Considerations&#8212;Environmental Risks.&#8221;\n\nThe generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to SCE&#8217;s workforce and the general public. \n\nElectricity poses hazards for SCE&#8217;s workforce and the general public should they come in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through energized downed power lines or if equipment malfunctions. In addition, the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation and storage facilities include public and workforce safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires.\n\nInjuries and property damage caused by such events can subject SCE to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. In addition, SCE may be held responsible for the actions of its contractors. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of SCE&#39;s or its contractors&#39; insurance coverage. The CPUC has increased its focus on public safety with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. Additionally, the CPUC has delegated to its staff the authority to issue citations to electric utilities, which can impose fines of up to $100,000 per violation per day (capped at a maximum of $8 million), pursuant to the CPUC&#39;s jurisdiction for violations of safety rules found in statutes, regulations, and the CPUC&#39;s General Orders. The CPUC also can issue fines greater than $8 million outside of the citation program. Such penalties and liabilities could be significant and materially affect SCE&#39;s liquidity and results of operations. \n\nSCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in constructing, operating, and maintaining its facilities and workforce. \n\nSCE&#39;s infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. SCE is also constructing utility owned storage to mitigate possible state-wide capacity shortages in 2023 and later years, and any delays in construction may result in those facilities being unavailable to reduce the impact of any capacity shortages in summer 2023. In addition, as described above, wildfires in SCE&#39;s service territory can cause significant public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. \n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, SCE is engaged in a significant and ongoing infrastructure investment program. This substantial investment program has inherent operational risks and elevates the need for superior execution in SCE&#39;s activities. SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in constructing, operating, and maintaining its facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous and important for system reliability. SCE&#39;s inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, contractor management, data and records accuracy, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental remediation and mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs or in recovering costs that are above original estimates, system limitations and degradation, maintaining physical security of workforce and assets, maintaining cybersecurity of data and assets, and delays and interruptions in necessary supplies, including key components necessary for the timely construction of utility owned storage. For example, SCE&#39;s financial condition may be materially affected as a result of safety incidents, delays, permitting violations and violations of regulatory requirements, among other things, caused by SCE&#39;s failure to appropriately manage its contractor workforce or from contractual violations by SCE&#39;s contractors and the inability for SCE to recover through contractual indemnities or insurance held by the contractor. SCE&#39;s financial condition may also be materially affected as a result of data or records inaccuracies, for example inaccurate records could lead to missing or delayed compliance with SCE&#39;s policies and regulatory requirements, and could contribute to safety incidents. SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of \n\noperations could also be materially affected if SCE is unable to attract, train and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, including due to the constrained labor market in California and nationally and SCE&#39;s relations with its unionized workforce. SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected as a result of atypical resolutions to litigation proceedings arising from its operations, including atypical settlements and verdicts. For instance, SCE was subject to an atypical jury verdict in a recent employment litigation matter. \n\nThere are inherent risks associated with owning and decommissioning nuclear power generation facilities and obtaining cost reimbursement, including, among other things, insufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust funds, costs exceeding current estimates, execution risks, potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and the hazards of storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect SCE fully against losses from a nuclear incident. \n\nSCE funds decommissioning costs with assets that are currently held in nuclear decommissioning trusts. Based upon the financial performance of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, as well as the resolution of a number of other uncertainties, assumptions and estimates, additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust&#8217;s funds may be required. If additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, recovery of any such additional funds through electric rates is subject to the CPUC&#39;s review and approval.\n\nThe costs of decommissioning San Onofre are subject to reasonableness reviews by the CPUC. These costs may not be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise unless SCE can establish that the costs were reasonably incurred. In addition, SCE faces inherent execution risks including such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition, permitting delays, and governmental approvals. Decommissioning costs ultimately incurred could exceed the current estimates and cost increases resulting from contractual disputes, delays in performance by the contractor, elevated levels of inflation, or permitting delays, among other things, could cause SCE to materially overrun current decommissioning cost estimates and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds. See &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Decommissioning of San Onofre&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nEven though San Onofre is being decommissioned, the presence of spent nuclear fuel still poses a potential risk of a nuclear incident. Federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately $13.7 billion for Palo Verde and $560 million for San Onofre. SCE and other owners of San Onofre and Palo Verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of $450 million per site. In the case of San Onofre, the balance is covered by a US Government indemnity. In the case of Palo Verde, the balance is covered by a loss sharing program among nuclear reactor licensees. There is no assurance that the CPUC would allow SCE to recover the required contribution made pursuant to this loss sharing program in the case of one or more nuclear incidents with claims that exceeded $450 million at a nuclear reactor which is participating in the program. If this public liability limit of $13.7 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. There can be no assurance of SCE&#39;s ability to recover uninsured costs in the event the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. For more information on nuclear insurance risk, see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Nuclear Insurance.&#34;\n\nSCE&#39;s distribution of water and propane gas on Catalina Island involves inherent risks of damage to private property and the environment and injury to employees and the general public. \n\nSCE owns and operates the water distribution system that serves Catalina Island, California and a propane gas distribution system that serves the City of Avalon on Catalina Island, California. Production, storage, treatment and distribution of water for human use and the transportation, storage, distribution and use of gas can be hazardous, and can cause damage to private property and the environment and injury to employees and the general public if equipment fails or does not perform as anticipated. For example, the risks of operating a water distribution system include the potential for burst pipes and water contamination and the risks of operating gas distribution system include the potential for gas leaks, fire or explosion. The risks related to SCE&#39;s operation of its water and gas distribution systems may be exacerbated due to aging infrastructure. SCE has requested that the CPUC allow SCE to include certain water system costs in electric rates and may make similar requests for the water and gas systems in the future. If such requests are denied, significant costs may not be recoverable from customers. In addition, SCE may have to pay fines, penalties and remediation costs if it does not comply with laws and regulations in the operation of the water and gas distribution systems. An inability to recover costs associated with any such damages or injuries or any fines, penalties or remediation costs, from insurance or through electric rates, could materially affect SCE&#39;s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFinancing Risks\n\nAs a capital-intensive company, SCE relies on access to the capital markets. If SCE were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations could be materially affected. \n\nSCE regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. SCE&#39;s needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. SCE&#39;s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including SCE&#39;s levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. In addition, the actions of other California investor-owned utilities and legal, regulatory and legislative decisions impacting investor-owned utilities can affect market conditions and therefore, SCE&#39;s ability to obtain financing. SCE&#39;s inability to obtain additional capital from time to time could have a material effect on SCE&#39;s liquidity and operations.\n\nCompetitive and Market Risks\n\nSCE&#39;s inability to effectively and timely respond to the changes that the electricity industry is undergoing, as a result of increased competition, technological advances, and changes to the regulatory environment, could materially impact SCE&#39;s business model, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nCustomers and third parties are increasingly deploying distributed energy resources (&#34;DERs&#34;), such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. California&#39;s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of industry change. This change will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid&#39;s capacity to interconnect DERs. In addition, enabling California&#39;s clean energy economy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure. If SCE is unable to effectively adapt to these changes, its business model, its ability to execute on its strategy, and ultimately its financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.\n\nCustomer-owned generation and load departures to CCAs or Electric Service Providers each reduce the amount of electricity that customers purchase from utilities and have the effect of increasing utility rates unless customer rates are designed to allocate the costs of the distribution grid across all customers that benefit from its use. For example, some customers in California who generate their own power are not currently required to pay all transmission and distribution charges and non-bypassable charges, subject to limitations, which results in increased costs for those customers who do not own their generation. If regulations aren&#39;t changed such that customers pay their share of transmission and distribution costs and non-bypassable charges and the demand for electricity reduces so significantly that SCE is no longer effectively able to recover such costs from its customers, SCE&#39;s business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially impacted.\n\nIn addition, the FERC has opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities.\n\nFor more information. See &#34;Business&#8212;SCE&#8212;Competition.&#34;\n\nCybersecurity and Physical Security Risks\n\nSCE&#39;s systems and network infrastructure are targets for physical and cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality. \n\nRegulators such as NERC and U.S. Government agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, have increasingly stressed that threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures, and that such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are highly sophisticated and dynamic. Several U.S. Government agencies have highlighted the increasing risks related to physical attacks, ransomware attacks and cybersecurity risks related to the electric sector, including its supply chains, and that the risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. \n\nSCE&#39;s operations require the continuous availability of critical information technology systems, sensitive customer and employee data and network infrastructure and information, all of which are targets for malicious actors. New cyber and physical threats arise as SCE moves from an analog to a digital electric grid. For example, SCE&#39;s grid modernization efforts and the move to a network-connected grid increases the number of &#8220;threat surfaces&#8221; and potential vulnerabilities that an adversary can target. SCE system data and architecture are also disclosed, either intentionally or unintentionally, to third parties and the public by regulators, employees, contractors and vendors. This system information may be used by malicious actors to understand SCE&#8217;s systems to prepare for a cyber or physical attack.\n\nSCE depends on a wide array of vendors to provide it with services and equipment. Malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services they provide to SCE, or to use those vendors as a conduit to attack SCE. Additionally, the equipment and material provided by SCE&#39;s vendors may contain cyber vulnerabilities. A compromise of equipment and/or exfiltration of SCE data, whether by physical or by electronic means, could result in loss or changes to confidential or sensitive electronic data, loss of intellectual property and interruption of business processes. While some of SCE&#39;s vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, such incidents have not, to SCE&#39;s knowledge, resulted in a material impact to SCE to date.\n\nSCE&#39;s systems have experienced, and will continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents involving attacks of malicious code, unauthorized access attempts, and other illicit activities, but to SCE&#39;s knowledge it has not experienced a material cybersecurity or data breach to date. Though SCE actively monitors developments in this area, no security measures can completely shield its systems, infrastructure and data from cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.\n\nIf SCE&#39;s information technology and operational technology systems&#39; security measures were to be breached, or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, SCE could be unable to fulfill critical business functions, such as delivery of electricity to customers, and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, material financial loss to SCE or to its customers, loss of confidence in SCE&#39;s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation and/or regulatory exposure, all of which could materially affect SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations and materially damage the business reputation of Edison International and SCE.\n\nRISKS RELATING TO EDISON INTERNATIONAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY \n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted by events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, that cause significant disruption to workforces, supply chains, economies, or societies on a regional, statewide, national or global basis. \n\nEdison International and SCE could be materially and adversely impacted by events, such as the widespread outbreak of a communicable disease, that result in, among other things, significant disruption to supply chains, economies, societies or workforces on a regional, statewide, national or global basis. For example, the global spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, created significant uncertainty, volatility and disruption globally and has impacted the operations of Edison International and SCE. \n\nMany of the risks and uncertainties identified in this Form 10-K are, and will be, exacerbated by the impacts of an event like a pandemic and the actions being taken by governmental entities, businesses, individuals and others in response to such an event. For example, SCE may be unable to effectively execute its PSPS program due to, among other things, requests from local and State authorities not to shut off the power during a pandemic or other event, and thereby may increase the risk of SCE equipment being associated with the ignition of wildfires.\n\nIn addition, impacts of a pandemic or similar event on SCE&#39;s customers and third parties could also result in SCE facing, among other things, significant reductions in demand for electricity and payment delays and/or defaults from customers which could result in significant under-collections. In addition, Edison International and SCE could also face payment delays and/or defaults from insurers and other counterparties. Furthermore, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s access to the bank and capital markets could also be constrained and/or the costs of accessing those markets could increase as a result of a pandemic or similar event, including if Edison International&#39;s and/or SCE&#39;s credit ratings are downgraded, or placed on negative watch due to concerns about Edison International and/or SCE&#39;s financial health as a result of the impacts of the pandemic. SCE may also incur significant incremental costs as a result of actions it is taking in response to a pandemic or a similar event, including costs being incurred to maintain its operations and assist its employees who are required to telework or are otherwise impacted by the event. SCE could also face delays in important legal and \n\nregulatory proceedings. These impacts, among others, could materially and adversely impact Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s business, operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial results.\n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s business activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region.\n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s business activities are concentrated in the electric utility industry. Edison International&#39;s principal subsidiary, SCE, serves customers only in southern and central California. As a result, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to California or by regional regulation, legislation or judicial decisions. For example, California courts have applied strict liability to investor-owned utilities in wildfire and other litigation matters. See &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12.

      "text": " Properties \n\nSCE supplies electricity to its customers through extensive transmission and distribution networks. Its transmission facilities, which are located primarily in California but also in Nevada and Arizona, deliver power from generating sources to the distribution network and consist of approximately 13,000 circuit-miles of lines ranging from 55 kV to 500 kV and approximately 80 transmission substations. SCE&#39;s distribution system, which takes power from distribution substations to customers, consists of approximately 38,000 circuit-miles of overhead lines, approximately 31,000 circuit-miles of underground lines and approximately 730 distribution substations. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, SCE had ownership interests in generating and energy storage facilities, primarily located in California, with approximately 7,000 MW of net physical capacity, of which SCE&#39;s pro-rata share is approximately 3,000 MW. SCE&#39;s pro rata share includes approximately 73 MW of capacity from facilities that were not operational or out of service at December 31, 2022, other than for routine maintenance purposes, and excludes retired facilities. In addition to its current facilities, in October 2021, SCE contracted for the construction of utility owned storage at three sites in SCE&#39;s service territory with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 MW, which SCE has been advised will be in-service prior to June 2023. See &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Capital Program&#8212;Utility Owned Storage Projects &#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nCertain of SCE&#39;s substations, and portions of its transmission, distribution and communication systems are located on lands owned by the federal, state or local governments under licenses, permits, easements or leases, or on public streets or highways pursuant to franchises. Certain of the documents evidencing such rights obligate SCE, under specified circumstances and at its expense, to relocate such transmission, distribution, and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal, state, or local governments.\n\nSCE owns and operates hydroelectric plants and related reservoirs, the majority of which are located in whole or in part on U.S.-owned lands and are subject to FERC licenses. Slightly over half of these plants have FERC licenses that expire at various times through 2046. FERC licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on SCE, including the right of the United States to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation. When existing licenses expire, the FERC has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties that have filed competing license applications, but only if their license application is superior to SCE&#39;s and then only upon payment of specified compensation to SCE. New licenses issued to SCE are expected to contain more restrictions and obligations than the expired licenses because laws enacted since the existing licenses were issued require the FERC to give environmental objectives greater consideration in the licensing process. In addition, SCE expects additional opposition to new licenses by environmental stakeholder groups. If, in the future, SCE decides to, or is forced to, decommission one or more hydroelectric projects, the costs related to the decommissioning will be substantial. The CPUC approved SCE recovering a portion of estimated of decommissioning costs for hydroelectric projects in the 2021 GRC.\n\nSubstantially all of SCE&#39;s properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds. See &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 5. Debt and Credit Agreements.&#34; \n\nSeasonality\n\nDue to warm weather during the summer months and SCE&#39;s rate design, operating revenue during the third quarter of each year is generally higher than the other quarters. However, as discussed above, SCE earnings are not affected by changes in retail electricity sales. See &#34;Overview of Ratemaking Process&#34; above. \n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES\n\nWildfires in SCE&#39;s territory, including those where SCE&#39;s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire&#39;s ignition, have caused loss of life and substantial damage in recent years. Multiple factors have contributed to increased wildfire activity and faster progression of wildfires across SCE&#39;s service territory and in other areas of California. These include the buildup of dry vegetation in areas severely impacted by years of historic drought, lack of adequate clearing of hazardous fuels by responsible parties, higher temperatures, lower humidity, increased incidence of dry lightning, and strong Santa Ana winds. At the same time that wildfire risk has been increasing in Southern California, residential and commercial development has occurred and is occurring in some of the highest-risk areas. Such factors can increase the likelihood and extent of wildfires. SCE has determined that approximately 27% of its service territory is in areas identified as high fire risk.\n\nCalifornia has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years due to climate change, and SCE&#39;s service territory remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity in 2023 and beyond. The worsening weather and fuel conditions across California increase the likelihood of wildfires, including those where SCE&#39;s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire&#39;s ignition. In response to worsening conditions and increased wildfire activity over the past several years, SCE has been focused on developing and implementing plans aimed at reducing the risk of SCE equipment contributing to the ignition of wildfires, from its 2018 Gris Safety and Resiliency Program to its WMPs. In addition, California has increased its investment in wildfire prevention and fire suppression capabilities.\n\nMultiple lawsuits related to wildfire events have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. For further information, see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides,&#34; &#34;Risk Factors&#34; and &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nRecovery of Wildfire-Related Costs \n\nPre-AB 1054 Cost Recovery \n\nCalifornia courts have previously found investor-owned utilities to be strictly liable for property damage, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility&#39;s facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. The rationale stated by these courts for applying this theory to investor-owned utilities is that property damages resulting from a public improvement, such as the distribution of electricity, can be spread across the larger community that benefited from such improvement through recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs in electric rates. However, in November 2017, the CPUC issued a decision denying SDG&#38;E&#39;s request to include in its rates uninsured wildfire-related costs arising from several 2007 wildfires, finding that SDG&#38;E did not meet the prudency standard because it did not prudently manage and operate its facilities prior to or at the outset of the 2007 wildfires. In July 2018, the CPUC denied both SDG&#38;E&#39;s application for rehearing on its cost recovery request and a joint application for rehearing filed by SCE and PG&#38;E limited to the applicability of inverse condemnation principles in the same proceeding. The California Court of Appeal, the California Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have denied SDG&#38;E&#39;s petitions for review of the CPUC&#39;s denial of SDG&#38;E&#39;s application. \n\n2019 Wildfire Legislation \n\nIn July 2019, AB 1054 was signed by the Governor of California and became effective immediately. The summary of the wildfire legislation below is based on SCE&#39;s interpretation of AB 1054.\n\nAB 1054 Prudency Standard \n\nUnder AB 1054, the CPUC must apply a revised standard when assessing the prudency of a utility in connection with a request for recovery of wildfire costs for wildfires ignited after July 12, 2019. Under AB 1054, the CPUC is required to find a utility to be prudent if the utility&#39;s conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. Prudent conduct under the AB 1054 standard is not limited to the optimum practice, method, or act to the exclusion of others, but rather encompasses a spectrum of possible practices, methods, or acts consistent with utility system needs, the interest of the ratepayers, and the requirements of governmental agencies. AB 1054 also clarifies that the CPUC may determine that wildfire costs may be recoverable, in whole or in part, by taking into account factors within and outside the utility&#39;s control, including humidity, temperature, and winds. Further, utilities with a valid safety certification will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility&#39;s conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to prove its conduct was prudent. If a utility does not have a valid safety certification, it will have the burden to prove, based on a preponderance of evidence, that its conduct was prudent. The new prudency standard will survive the termination of the Wildfire Insurance Fund.\n\nUtilities participating in the Wildfire Insurance Fund that are found to be prudent are not required to reimburse the fund for amounts withdrawn from the fund and can recover wildfire costs through electric rates if the fund has been exhausted.\n\nWildfire Insurance Fund \n\nAB 1054 provided for the Wildfire Insurance Fund to reimburse a utility for payment of third-party damage claims arising from certain wildfires that exceed, in aggregate in a calendar year, the greater of $1.0 billion or the insurance coverage required to be maintained under AB 1054. The Wildfire Insurance Fund was established in September 2019 and is available for claims related to wildfires ignited after July 12, 2019 that are determined by the responsible government investigatory agency to have been caused by a utility.\n\nSCE and SDG&#38;E collectively made their initial contributions totaling approximately $2.7 billion (SCE share is $2.4 billion) to the Wildfire Insurance Fund in September 2019. Upon its emergence from bankruptcy, on July 1, 2020, PG&#38;E made its initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion to the Wildfire Insurance Fund. PG&#38;E, SCE and SDG&#38;E are also collectively expected to make aggregate contributions of approximately $3.0 billion (SCE share is $950 million) to the Wildfire Insurance Fund through annual contributions to the fund over a 10-year period by no later than January 1 of each year, of which they have made three annual contributions totaling approximately $1.2 billion (SCE share is approximately $380 million). In addition to PG&#38;E&#39;s, SCE&#39;s and SDG&#38;E&#39;s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, PG&#38;E, SCE and SDG&#38;E are expected to collect $6.1 billion, $6.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, from their customers over a 15-year period through a dedicated rate component. The amount collected from customers may be directly contributed to the Wildfire Insurance Fund or used to support the issuance of up to $10.5 billion in bonds by the California Department of Water Resources, the proceeds of which would be contributed to the fund. In addition to funding contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, the amount collected from utility customers will pay for, among other things, any interest and financing costs related to any bonds that are issued by the California Department of Water Resources to support the contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund. \n\nSCE&#39;s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund will not be recoverable through electric rates and will be excluded from the measurement of SCE&#39;s CPUC-jurisdictional authorized capital structure. SCE will also not be entitled to cost recovery for any borrowing costs incurred in connection with its contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund. For information on the accounting impact of SCE&#39;s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8212;Initial and annual contributions to the wildfire insurance fund established pursuant to California Assembly Bill 1054 &#34; in this report.\n\nReimbursement from Wildfire Insurance Fund and AB 1054 Liability Cap \n\nParticipating investor-owned utilities will be reimbursed from the Wildfire Insurance Fund for eligible claims, subject to the fund administrator&#39;s review. SCE will reimburse the fund for any withdrawn amounts if SCE receives payment of such amounts under an indemnification agreement or from an insurance provider or other third-party. SCE will also be required to reimburse the fund for withdrawn amounts that the CPUC disallows, subject to the AB 1054 Liability Cap. If the utility has maintained a valid safety certification and its actions or inactions that resulted in the wildfire are not found to constitute conscious or willful disregard of the rights and safety of others, the aggregate requirement to reimburse the fund over a trailing three calendar year period is capped at 20% of the equity portion of the utility&#39;s transmission and distribution rate base in the year of the prudency determination. Based on SCE&#39;s forecasted weighted-average 2023 transmission and distribution rate base, excluding general plant and intangibles, and using the equity portion of SCE&#39;s CPUC authorized capital structure of 52%, SCE&#39;s requirement to reimburse the Wildfire Insurance Fund for eligible claims disallowed in 2023 would be capped at approximately $3.8 billion.\n\nSCE will not be allowed to recover borrowing costs incurred to reimburse the fund for amounts that the CPUC disallows. The Wildfire Insurance Fund and, consequently, the AB 1054 Liability Cap will terminate when the administrator determines that the fund has been exhausted.\n\nSafety Certification and Wildfire Mitigation Plan \n\nUnder AB 1054, SCE can obtain an annual safety certification upon the submission by September 14th of each year of certain required safety information, including an approved WMP. Under AB 1054, SCE is also required to submit a comprehensive WMP to the CPUC at least once every three years for review and approval. Each such comprehensive plan is now required to cover at least a three-year period. In addition, SCE anticipates updating its comprehensive three-year plans annually in the intervening years. \n\nSCE submitted its 2020 &#8211; 2022 WMP in February 2020 and most recently submitted updates to its plan in February 2022 to, among other things, report on implementation of its plan, describe new and ongoing wildfire mitigation activities and \n\nreport on its progress on remedying issues identified in an action statement issued by the OEIS in August 2021. In July 2022, the OEIS approved SCE&#39;s 2022 updates to its 2020 &#8211; 2022 WMP and the CPUC ratified the OEIS approval in August 2022. \n\nOn December 13, 2022, SCE obtained a safety certification that will be valid for 12 months. Notwithstanding its 12-month term, if SCE requested a new safety certification by September 14, 2023, then its current safety certification would remain valid until OEIS acts on SCE&#39;s request for a new safety certification. \n\nSCE expects to file its 2023 &#8211; 2025 WMP in March 2023.\n\nPublic Safety Power Shutoffs \n\nIn addition to the investments SCE is making as part of its WMP, SCE also uses Public Safety Power Shutoffs (&#34;PSPS&#34;) to proactively de-energize power lines as a last resort to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires during extreme weather events. SCE initiated PSPS 12 times in 2020 as part of its wildfire mitigation efforts resulting in an aggregate of approximately 268 million customer minutes interrupted. On a risk informed basis, SCE made efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS in 2021 as compared to 2020. SCE initiated PSPS ten times in 2021 resulting in approximately 222 million customer minutes interrupted. The 2021 events include a January 2021 event that resulted in approximately 118 million customer minutes interrupted. While SCE&#39;s wildfire mitigation efforts contributed to the reduction in use and impact of PSPS in 2021, the use of PSPS also depends on weather and fuel conditions. SCE initiated PSPS six times in 2022 resulting in approximately seven million customer minutes interrupted. As of February 16, 2023, SCE had not initiated any PSPS events in 2023. \n\nIn January 2021, the President of the CPUC sent SCE a letter expressing her concern regarding SCE&#39;s execution of PSPS in 2020 and notifying SCE that it must implement a PSPS action plan to reduce the impacts of PSPS on the customers and communities it serves. SCE has one item left to implement on its PSPS action plan. In June 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision which, among other things, will reduce future authorized revenue for the volumetric reductions in electricity sales resulting from PSPS events initiated after June 2021 until the CPUC determines that improvements in the PSPS program have been made.\n\nIn June 2022, the SED issued an Administrative Enforcement Order (&#34;AEO&#34;) against SCE proposing penalties of $10 million for alleged noncompliance with customer notification requirements related to PSPS events in 2020. In October 2022, the SED and SCE reached a settlement agreement under which SCE agreed to pay $7 million and complete certain corrective actions to resolve the AEO. SCE did not admit wrongdoing or liability as part of the settlement. SCE&#39;s obligations under the settlement agreement will commence after CPUC approval of the agreement is final and non-appealable. SCE has made and continues to make significant investments and progress in improving its PSPS protocols, including through increased automation of customer notifications. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nGreenhouse Gas Regulation\n\nEdison International recognizes that its industry and the global economy are in the midst of a profound transformation toward a low-carbon future as a response to climate change. SCE plans to be a key enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that benefit customers of the electric grid. See &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Electricity Industry Trends&#34; in the MD&#38;A. \n\nApproximately 66% of SCE&#39;s sources of utility-owned generation were carbon-free in 2022. SCE estimates that approximately 20% of power delivered to SCE&#39;s customers in 2022 came from SCE&#39;s own generating facilities, with approximately 9% nuclear, 3% large hydroelectric, less than 1% small hydroelectric, and less than 1% solar generation. Approximately 7% were natural gas sources. Since 2010, SCE has reported its annual GHG emissions from \n\nutility-owned generation each year to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency by March 31 of the following year. SCE&#39;s 2022 GHG emissions from utility-owned generation are estimated to be approximately 1,500,000 metric tons. \n\nCalifornia is committed to reducing its GHG emissions, improving local air quality and supporting continued economic growth. California&#39;s major initiatives for reducing GHG emissions include a law that targets the reduction of GHG emissions across the entire state economy to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and a California cap-and-trade program established by the California Air Resources Board (&#34;CARB&#34;). Other major policy measures include the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program established by CARB. In 2022, the California Climate Crisis Act declared the policy of the state to achiev e net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, but no later than 2045, to achieve and maintain net negative greenhouse gas emissions thereafter, and to ensure that by 2045, statewide anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to at least 85% below the 1990 levels. Edison International is committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2045, in alignment with economywide climate actions planned by California. This commitment covers the power SCE delivers to customers and Edison International&#39;s enterprise-wide operations. \n\nIn the California cap-and-trade program, all covered GHG emitters, including SCE, are subject to an annually declining program &#34;cap&#34; on emissions designed to encourage entities to reduce emissions from their operations. Covered entities must remit a compliance instrument for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent gas emitted and can do so buying state-issued emission allowances at auction or purchasing them in the secondary allowance market. From 2013 to 2020, GHG emitters could have met up to 8% of their cap-and-trade obligations by procuring GHG offset credits from verified offset programs, such as reforestation, that have recognized effects on reducing atmospheric GHGs. The offset usage limit has decreased to 4% for 2021 &#8211; 2025 emissions and will then increase to 6% for 2026 &#8211; 2030 emissions. Starting with 2021 emissions, no more than one-half of the quantitative offset usage limit may be sourced from projects that do not provide direct environmental benefits in California. \n\nCalifornia has adopted RPS targets that require California retail sellers of electricity to provide certain percentages of energy sales from renewable resources defined in the statute, including 33% of retail sales by December 2020; 44% of retail sales by December 2024, 52% of retail sales by December 2027, and 60% of retail sales by December 2030. Approximately 35% of SCE&#39;s supply portfolio in 2020 came from renewable sources eligible under California&#39;s RPS, of which 32% was delivered to customers and 3% was sold for resale. As such, SCE met California&#39;s 2020 RPS target. Approximately 39% of SCE&#39;s supply portfolio in 2022 came from renewable sources eligible under California&#39;s RPS, of which 36% was delivered to customers and 3% was sold for resale. SCE&#39;s climate change objectives align with California&#39;s requirements, and SCE remains well-positioned to meet California&#8217;s 2030 and 2045 RPS targets. \n\nSeparate from RPS targets, California requires the following percentages of retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers must be from carbon-free resources by the following deadlines: 90% by December 31, 2035, 95% by December 31, 2040, and 100% by December 31, 2045. California also requires each state agency to ensure that carbon free resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SCE plans to propose for CPUC approval new programs to help state agency customers meet their accelerated 100% clear power needs. SCE estimates that approximately 48% of SCE&#39;s customer deliveries in 2022 came from carbon-free resources. SCE believes that it is well-positioned to meet California&#8217;s carbon-free requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the CPUC and the California Energy Commission adopted GHG emission performance standards that apply to California investor-owned and publicly owned utilities&#39; long-term arrangements for the purchase of electricity. The standards prohibit these entities, including SCE, from owning or entering into long-term financial commitments with generators, such as coal plants, that emit more GHG than a combined-cycle natural gas turbine generator. California also supports climate action to meet the December 2015 Paris Agreement. \n\nEdison International supports these California environmental initiatives and has undertaken analysis which, consistent with third-party analysis, shows that electrification across multiple sectors, including transportation and industrial sectors, is among the most cost-effective ways to achieve California&#39;s requirements and goals. Edison International and SCE believe that these initiatives will lead to increased electrification across the economy and SCE is investing in grid technologies and charging infrastructure to support California&#39;s goals. \n\nEnvironmental Risks\n\nClimate change has, and continues to, impact California. Southern California has warmed 3 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, snowpack has declined, and the Western United States and Northern Mexico are experiencing their driest period in at least 1,200 years. Severe droughts and windstorms contributed to the devastating wildfires that swept through parts of California in recent years, demonstrating the serious threat that weather extremes caused by climate change pose to California&#39;s communities and the environment. See &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides&#34; in the MD&#38;A and &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires.&#34; \n\nSevere weather events, including drought, increasingly severe windstorms and rising sea-levels, pose risks to SCE&#39;s infrastructure and SCE and Edison International are investing in building a more resilient grid to reduce climate- and weather-related vulnerabilities. See &#34; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Regulatory Proceedings&#8212;Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nIn May 2022, SCE provided its climate adaptability vulnerability assessment (&#8220;CAVA&#8221;) to the CPUC. The CAVA addresses the projected climate impacts of temperature, sea level, precipitation, wildfire, and cascading impacts (such as rain on snow or debris flow) on SCE in the 2030, 2050, and 2070 timeframes. SCE&#8217;s CAVA will inform planning related to SCE assets, operations, and services, with the goal of maintaining a resilient electric grid in the face of climate change and will inform future investment in the grid.\n\nFor more information on risks related to climate change, environmental regulation and SCE&#39;s business strategy, see &#34;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company&#8212;Operating Risks.&#34;\n\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\nPROPERTIES\n\nAs a holding company, Edison International does not directly own any significant properties other than the stock of its subsidiaries. The principal properties of SCE are described above under &#34;Business&#8212;SCE&#8212;Properties.&#34;\n\n"

      "text": " LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\n2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events\n\nMultiple lawsuits related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events naming SCE as a defendant have been filed by three categories of plaintiffs: individual plaintiffs, subrogation plaintiffs and public entity plaintiffs. A number of the lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant and some of the lawsuits were filed as purported class actions. The litigation could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters and number of plaintiffs.\n\nAs of February 16, 2023, SCE was aware of approximately 120 currently pending lawsuits, representing approximately 1,000 plaintiffs, related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires naming SCE as a defendant. Approximately 95 of the approximately 120 pending lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. One of the lawsuits was filed as a purported class action. The lawsuits, which have been filed in the superior courts of Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties allege, among other things, negligence, inverse \n\ncondemnation, trespass, private nuisance, and violations of the public utilities and health and safety codes. SCE and certain of the individual plaintiffs in the Thomas and Koenigstein Fire litigation have been pursuing settlements of claims under a mediation program adopted to promote an efficient and orderly settlement process. Some individual plaintiffs have opted to pursue trial outside of the settlement program.\n\nApproximately 30 of the approximately 120 pending lawsuits mentioned in the paragraph above allege that SCE has responsibility for the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires and that the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused the Montecito Mudslides, resulting in the plaintiffs&#39; claimed damages. Many of the Montecito Mudslides lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. In addition to other causes of action, some of the Montecito Mudslides lawsuits also allege personal injury and wrongful death. A bellwether jury trial previously scheduled for October 12, 2020 was vacated due to the wide-spread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs of February 16, 2023, SCE was aware of approximately 370 currently pending lawsuits, representing approximately 3,000 plaintiffs, related to the Woolsey Fire naming SCE as a defendant. Approximately 110 of the 370 lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant based on its ownership and alleged control of SCE. At least one of the lawsuits was filed as a purported class action. The lawsuits, which have been filed in the superior courts of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, personal injury, wrongful death, trespass, private nuisance, and violations of the public utilities and health and safety codes. SCE and certain of the individual plaintiffs in the Woolsey Fire litigation have been pursuing settlements of claims under a mediation program adopted to promote an efficient and orderly settlement process. Some individual plaintiffs may opt to pursue trial outside of the settlement program.\n\nThe Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and Montecito Mudslides lawsuits are being coordinated in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Woolsey Fire lawsuits have also been coordinated in the Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nFor further information, including regarding settlement activity related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides.&#34; \n\nEnvironmental Proceedings\n\nEach of Edison International and SCE have elected to disclose environmental proceedings described in Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation SK unless it reasonably believes that such proceeding will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of less than $1,000,000. \n\nMission Canyon \n\nSCE performed 1.6 miles of access road grading and vegetation clearing in the Mission Canyon area of Santa Barbara County in December 2019, resulting in debris moving downslope into a creek bed and other impacts in the area (the &#34;Mission Canyon Incident&#34;). Several state and federal environmental agencies and the County and City of Santa Barbara have investigated the unpermitted grading and discharges to the creek, and SCE has received Notices of Violation from the Army Corps of Engineers, the County of Santa Barbara, the California Department of Fish &#38; Wildlife and the Regional Water Quality Control Board. In December 2020, SCE and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney entered into a settlement regarding alleged criminal and civil violations related to the Mission Canyon Incident. Under the settlement, SCE pled no contest to a single misdemeanor charge for violation of the California Water Code and agreed to pay a $10,000 fine. SCE also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $3.5 million and is subject to an injunction compelling it to complete planned remediation work related to the Mission Canyon Incident and not commit similar violations for five years. It is presently unknown whether any regulatory agencies will impose additional fines or penalties on SCE with respect to the Mission Canyon Incident and, if so, in what amounts. SCE does not expect fines or penalties that are \n\nimposed in connection with the Mission Canyon Incident to be material. \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

We also have audited the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company&#39;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\n&#8203; \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nContingent Liability &#8211; 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events \n\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire, the Montecito Mudslides and the Woolsey Fire (collectively, the &#34;2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events&#34;) within the Company&#39;s service territory caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for SCE customers in the Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties. Numerous claims related to wildfire events have been initiated against the Company. The Company has incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid $7.6 billion under executed settlements, had $185 million to be paid under executed settlements, including $120 million to be paid under the SED executed Agreement, and had $934 million of estimated losses for remaining alleged and potential claims reflected on their consolidated balance sheets related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of $142 million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Each reporting period, management reviews its loss estimates for remaining alleged and potential claims related to wildfire events. The process for estimating losses associated with alleged and potential wildfire related claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including, but not limited to: estimates of known and expected claims by third parties based on currently available information, opinions of counsel regarding litigation risk, the status of and developments in the course of litigation, and prior experience litigating and settling wildfire litigation claims. As additional information becomes available, management&#39;s estimates and assumptions regarding the causes and financial impact of wildfire events may change. For instance, as a result of additional information, in 2022 management accrued additional estimated losses of $1.3 billion for claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of $76 million. The resulting net charge to earnings was $1.2 billion ($879 million after-tax). \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events contingent liability is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the probability of a loss being incurred and the best estimate of expected potential loss for these \n\ncontingencies related to assumptions and subjective factors based on currently available information and assessments, opinions regarding litigation risk, and prior experience with litigating and settling other wildfire cases. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#39;s conclusion related to these loss contingencies. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#39;s evaluation of loss contingencies associated with wildfires and mudslides. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, assessing the reasonableness of management&#39;s assessment regarding whether it is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable that a loss has been incurred, evaluating the assumptions and methods used by management in developing the best estimate of expected potential losses, including currently available information and assessments, opinions regarding litigation risk, and prior experience with litigating and settling other wildfire cases, and testing damage claim settlements. When assessing the assumptions related to the best estimate of expected potential losses, the assumptions used were evaluated for reasonableness considering (i) current damage claim settlements, (ii) past wildfire litigation history, and (iii) third-party source data. \n\n&#8203; \n\nRecoverability of Regulatory Assets That Are Not Currently Reflected In Rates \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#39;s accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which reflect the ratemaking policies of the CPUC and the FERC. Management applies authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises to the portion of its operations in which regulators set rates at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments in assets, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of electric utility revenue, these accounting principles require an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense by a non-regulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the cost is recoverable through future rates. As disclosed by management, management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost of the Company or other rate-regulated entities, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. As of December 31, 2022, $1.52 billion recorded in wildfire and drought restoration accounts and wildfire-related memorandum accounts represent wildfire and drought restoration costs that are probable of future recovery from customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company&#39;s recoverability of regulatory assets that are not currently reflected in rates is a critical audit matter is the significant judgment by management in determining the costs probable of recovery and reported as an asset on the balance sheet. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#39;s assessment of the recoverability of regulatory assets not currently reflected in rates.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company&#39;s regulatory accounting process, including controls over management&#39;s assessment of the probability of recovering regulatory assets not currently reflected in rates. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company&#39;s correspondence with regulators, evaluating management&#39;s assessment regarding the probability of recovery of the regulatory assets at the balance sheet date, evaluating the accounting and disclosure implications, and calculating regulatory assets balances based on provisions outlined in the rate orders. This evidence included reference to historical precedence of similar items and accounting treatment utilized by comparable companies under similar regulatory jurisdictions as well as evaluating progress in discussions between management and the regulator.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nLos Angeles, California \n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\n&#8203; \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Southern California Edison Company\n\n&#8203; \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern California Edison Company and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\n&#8203; \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#39;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nContingent Liability &#8211; 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events \n\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire, the Montecito Mudslides and the Woolsey Fire (collectively, the &#34;2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events&#34;) within the Company&#39;s service territory caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for SCE \n\ncustomers in the Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties.

As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of $142 million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Each reporting period, management reviews its loss estimates for remaining alleged and potential claims related to wildfire events. The process for estimating losses associated with alleged and potential wildfire related claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including, but not limited to: estimates of known and expected claims by third parties based on currently available information, opinions of counsel regarding litigation risk, the status of and developments in the course of litigation, and prior experience litigating and settling wildfire litigation claims. As additional information becomes available, management&#39;s estimates and assumptions regarding the causes and financial impact of wildfire events may change. For instance, as a result of additional information, in 2022 management accrued additional estimated losses of $1.3 billion for claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of $76 million. The resulting net charge to earnings was $1.2 billion ($879 million after-tax). \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events contingent liability is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the probability of a loss being incurred and the best estimate of expected potential loss for these contingencies related to assumptions and subjective factors based on currently available information and assessments, opinions regarding litigation risk, and prior experience with litigating and settling other wildfire cases. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#39;s conclusion related to these loss contingencies. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#39;s evaluation of loss contingencies associated with wildfires and mudslides. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, assessing the reasonableness of management&#39;s assessment regarding whether it is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable that a loss has been incurred, evaluating the assumptions and methods used by management in developing the best estimate of expected potential losses, including currently available information and assessments, opinions regarding litigation risk, and prior experience with litigating and settling other wildfire cases, and testing damage claim settlements. When assessing the assumptions related to the best estimate of expected potential losses, the assumptions used were evaluated for reasonableness considering (i) current damage claim settlements, (ii) past wildfire litigation history, and (iii) third-party source data. \n\nRecoverability of Regulatory Assets That Are Not Currently Reflected In Rates \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#39;s accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which reflect the ratemaking policies of the CPUC and the FERC. Management applies authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises to the portion of its operations in which regulators set rates at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments in assets, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of electric utility revenue, these accounting principles require an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense by a non-regulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the cost is recoverable through future rates. As disclosed by management, management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost of the Company or other rate-regulated entities, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. As of December 31, 2022, $1.52 billion recorded in wildfire and drought restoration accounts and wildfire-related memorandum accounts represent wildfire and drought restoration costs that are probable of future \n\nrecovery from customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company&#39;s recoverability of regulatory assets that are not currently reflected in rates is a critical audit matter is the significant judgment by management in determining the costs probable of recovery and reported as an asset on the balance sheet. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#39;s assessment of the recoverability of regulatory assets not currently reflected in rates.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company&#39;s regulatory accounting process, including controls over management&#39;s assessment of the probability of recovering regulatory assets not currently reflected in rates. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company&#39;s correspondence with regulators, evaluating management&#39;s assessment regarding the probability of recovery of the regulatory assets at the balance sheet date, evaluating the accounting and disclosure implications, and calculating regulatory assets balances based on provisions outlined in the rate orders. This evidence included reference to historical precedence of similar items and accounting treatment utilized by comparable companies under similar regulatory jurisdictions as well as evaluating progress in discussions between management and the regulator.\n\n&#8203;

\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization and Basis of Presentation\n\nEdison International is the ultimate parent holding company of Southern California Edison Company (&#34;SCE&#34;) and Edison Energy, LLC (&#34;Edison Energy Group&#34;). SCE is an investor-owned public utility primarily engaged in the business of supplying and delivering electricity to an approximately 50,000 square mile area of Southern California. Edison Energy Group is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison International and a holding company for Edison Energy, LLC (&#34;Edison Energy&#34;) which is engaged in the competitive business of providing decarbonization and energy solutions to commercial, institutional and industrial customers in North America and Europe. Edison Energy&#39;s business activities are currently not material to report as a separate business segment. These combined notes to the consolidated financial statements apply to both Edison International and SCE unless otherwise described. Edison International&#39;s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edison International, SCE, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. References to Edison International refer to the consolidated group of Edison International and its subsidiaries. References to &#34;Edison International Parent and Other&#34; refer to Edison International Parent and its competitive subsidiaries and &#34;Edison International Parent&#34; refer to Edison International on a stand-alone basis, not consolidated with its subsidiaries. SCE&#39;s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SCE, its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries and a variable interest entity of which SCE is the primary beneficiary, SCE Recovery Funding LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.\n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#34;GAAP&#34;), including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which reflect the ratemaking policies of the California Public Utility Commission (&#34;CPUC&#34;) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#34;FERC&#34;). SCE applies authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises to the portion of its operations in which regulators set rates at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments in assets, or rate base. Regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of electric utility revenue, these principles require an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense by a non-regulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that the cost is recoverable through future rates; and conversely the principles require recording of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and refundable to customers. In addition, SCE recognizes revenue and regulatory assets from alternative revenue programs, which enables the utility to adjust future rates in response to past activities or completed events, if certain criteria are met. SCE assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. See Note 11 for composition of regulatory assets and liabilities. \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been conformed to the current year&#39;s presentation, including separate presentation of common stock and preferred and preference stock dividends in SCE&#39;s consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\nCash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds. Generally, the carrying value of cash equivalents equals the fair value, as these investments have original maturities of three months or less. The cash equivalents were as follows: \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nEdison International\n\n&#8203; \n\nSCE\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMoney market funds\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nCash is temporarily invested until required for check clearing.

Since the customer base of SCE is concentrated in Southern California and exposes SCE to a homogeneous set of economic conditions, the allowance is measured on a collective basis on the historical amounts written-off, assessment of customer collectibility and current economic trends, including unemployment rates and likelihood of recession for the region. At December 31, 2022, this included the estimated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in June 2022, California&#39;s state assembly passed legislation to authorize, fund and implement the California Arrearage Payment Program (&#34;CAPP&#34;) 2022, which reduced customer arrearages for certain residential customers. The allowance for uncollectible accounts recorded against qualified arrearages was reduced by $ 83 million based on the receipt of CAPP in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe following table sets forth the changes in allowance for uncollectible accounts for SCE: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#8203; \n\nCustomers\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAll others\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal\n\nBalance at December 31, 2019 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nCurrent period provision for uncollectible accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncluded in operation and maintenance expenses in earning activities 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in operation and maintenance expenses in cost-recovery activities 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDeferred to regulatory memorandum accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 16 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 10 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 26 )\n\nBalance at December 31, 2020 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nCurrent period provision for uncollectible accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncluded in operation and maintenance expenses in earning activities 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in operation and maintenance expenses in cost-recovery activities 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDeferred to regulatory memorandum accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 6 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 8 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 14 )\n\nBalance at December 31, 2021&#179; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nCurrent period provision for uncollectible accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncluded in operation and maintenance expenses in earning activities 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in operation and maintenance expenses in cost-recovery activities 2,4 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDeferred to regulatory memorandum accounts 4 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 18 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 18 )\n\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 70 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 7 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 77 )\n\nBalance at December 31, 2022&#179; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Earning activities is one of SCE&#39;s disaggregated revenue sources. See Note 7 for further details. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 Cost-recovery activities is one of SCE&#39;s disaggregated revenue sources. See Note 7 for further details. This portion of costs from the allowance for uncollectible expenses is recovered through the residential uncollectibles balancing account. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 Approximately $ 7 million and $ 116 million of allowance for uncollectible accounts are included in long-term &#34;Receivables&#34; on SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4 Represents current year changes in the allowance for uncollectible accounts and excludes authorized recovery of previously deferred balances. ##TABLE_END \n\nInventory\n\nSCE&#39;s inventory is primarily composed of materials, supplies and spare parts, and generally stated at weighted average cost.\n\nEmission Allowances and Energy Credits\n\nSCE is allocated greenhouse gas (&#34;GHG&#34;) allowances annually which it is then required to sell into quarterly auctions. GHG proceeds from the auctions are recorded as a regulatory liability to be refunded to customers. SCE purchases GHG allowances in quarterly auctions or from counterparties to satisfy its GHG emission compliance obligations and recovers such costs of GHG allowances from customers. GHG allowances held for use are classified as &#34;Other current assets&#34; on the consolidated balance sheets and are stated, similar to an inventory method, at the lower of weighted average cost or market. SCE will evaluate GHG allowances for impairment upon a triggering event that would indicate SCE might not recover the full cost of an allowance. SCE had GHG allowances held for use of $ 87 million and $ 47 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. GHG emission obligations were $ 55 million and $ 34 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classified as &#34;Other current liabilities&#34; on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSCE is allocated low carbon fuel standard (&#34;LCFS&#34;) credits which it sells to market participants. Proceeds from the sales, net of selling fees and program administration expenses, are recorded in a balancing account to be refunded to eligible customers. SCE&#39;s net proceeds from the sale of these LCFS credits were $ 218 million and $ 193 million and are classified as &#34;Regulatory liabilities&#34; on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n\nSCE plant additions, including replacements and betterments, are capitalized. Direct material and labor and indirect costs such as construction overhead, administrative and general costs, pension and benefits, and property taxes are capitalized as part of plant additions. The CPUC authorizes a capitalization rate for each of the indirect costs which are allocated to each project based on either labor or total costs.\n\nEstimated useful lives authorized by the CPUC in the 2021 General Rate Case (&#34;GRC&#34;) and weighted average useful lives of SCE&#39;s property, plant and equipment, are as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nWeighted Average \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nEstimated Useful Lives\n\n&#160;\n\nUseful Lives\n\nGeneration plant\n\n&#8203; \n\n10 years to 55 years \n\n&#8203; \n\n39 years \n\nDistribution plant\n\n&#160;\n\n20 years to 67 years \n\n&#8203; \n\n50 years \n\nTransmission plant\n\n&#160;\n\n30 years to 65 years \n\n&#8203; \n\n53 years \n\nGeneral plant and other\n\n&#160;\n\n5 years to 60 years \n\n&#8203; \n\n20 years \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nDepreciation of utility property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line, remaining-life basis. SCE&#39;s depreciation expense was $ 2.5 billion, $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Depreciation expense stated as a percent of average original cost of depreciable utility plant was, on a composite basis, 4.2 %, 3.7 % and 3.6 % for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The original costs of retired property are charged to accumulated depreciation. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nNuclear fuel for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (&#34;Palo Verde&#34;) is recorded as utility plant (nuclear fuel in the fabrication and installation phase is recorded as construction in progress) in accordance with CPUC ratemaking procedures. Palo Verde nuclear fuel is amortized using the units of production method.\n\nAllowance for funds used during construction (&#34;AFUDC&#34;) represents the estimated cost of debt and equity funds that finance utility-plant construction and is capitalized during certain plant construction. AFUDC is recovered in rates through depreciation expense over the useful life of the related asset. AFUDC equity represents a method to compensate SCE for the estimated cost of equity used to finance utility plant additions and is recorded as part of construction in progress. AFUDC equity was $ 137 million, $ 118 million and $ 121 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is reflected in &#34;Other income.&#34; AFUDC debt was $ 53 million, $ 50 million and $ 53 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively and is reflected as a reduction of &#34;Interest expense.&#34;\n\nMajor Maintenance\n\nMajor maintenance costs for SCE&#39;s facilities and equipment are expensed as incurred.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nImpairments of long-lived assets are evaluated based on a review of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investments or assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount. Fair value is determined via market, cost and income-based valuation techniques, as appropriate.\n\nAccounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises also require recognition of an impairment loss if it becomes probable that the regulated utility will abandon a plant investment, or if it becomes probable that the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed, either directly or indirectly, for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made.\n\nIn September 2022, the CPUC approved the settlement agreement between SCE and The Utility Reform Network for SCE&#39;s Customer Service Re-platform (&#34;CSRP&#34;) proceeding filed in 2021 for expenditures incurred through April 2021. As a result of the settlement agreement, SCE recorded a $ 47 million ($ 34 million after-tax) impairment of property, plant and equipment, reflected in &#34;Impairment, net of other (income)&#34; in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nIn August 2021, as a result of adoption of 2021 GRC, SCE recorded $ 79 million ($ 47 million after-tax) in impairment charges related to disallowed historical capital expenditures of pole replacements the CPUC determined were performed prematurely in 2021. The impairment is included in &#34;Impairment, net of other (income)&#34; in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, SCE has $ 177 million and $ 186 million in assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in relation to restoration costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, respectively, which may not be recoverable. These assets would be impaired if the restoration costs are permanently disallowed by the CPUC in future cost recovery proceedings. For further details, see Note 12.\n\nInitial and annual contributions to the wildfire insurance fund established pursuant to California Assembly Bill 1054 (the &#34;Wildfire Insurance Fund&#34; and &#34;AB 1054&#34;) \n\nEdison International and SCE accounted for the contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund similarly to prepaid insurance. No period of coverage was provided in AB 1054, therefore expense is being allocated to periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Edison International and SCE had a $ 2.2 billion and a $ 2.4 billion long-term asset, respectively, as well as a $ 204 million current asset for both years, reflected as &#34;Wildfire Insurance Fund contributions&#34; in their consolidated balance sheets for the initial $ 2.4 billion contribution made during 2019 and the present value of annual contributions SCE committed to make to the Wildfire Insurance Fund, reduced by amortization. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, long-term liabilities of $ 536 million and $ 620 million, respectively, have been reflected in &#34;Other deferred credits and other long-term liabilities&#34; for the present value of unpaid contributions. Contributions were discounted to the present value using US treasury interest rates at the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund.\n\nIn 2022 and 2021, the asset was amortized based on an estimated period of coverage of 15 years . All expenses related to the contributions are being reflected in &#34;Wildfire Insurance Fund Expense&#34; in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the estimated period of coverage provided by the Wildfire Insurance Fund could lead to material changes in future expense recognition. In estimating the period of coverage, Edison International and SCE used Monte Carlo simulations based on historical data from wildfires caused by electrical utility equipment to estimate expected losses, using eight years (2014 &#8211; 2021) of available historical data in 2022 and seven years (2014 &#8211; 2020) of available historical data in 2021. The details of the operation of the Wildfire Insurance Fund and estimates related to claims by SCE, Pacific Gas &#38; Electric Company (&#34;PG&#38;E&#34;), and San Diego Gas &#38; Electric (&#34;SDG&#38;E&#34;) against the fund have been applied to the expected loss simulations to estimate the period of coverage of the fund. The most sensitive inputs to the estimated period of coverage are the expected frequency of wildfire events caused by investor-owned utility electrical equipment and the estimated costs associated with those forecasted events. Edison International and SCE evaluate all inputs annually, or upon claims being made from the fund for catastrophic wildfires, and the expected life of the insurance fund will be adjusted as required. Based on information available in the first quarter of 2023 regarding catastrophic wildfires during 2022, SCE reassessed its estimate of the life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. Using nine years of historical data (2014 &#8211; 2022) of wildfires caused by electrical utility equipment to create Monte Carlo simulations of expected losses, \n\nthe expected life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund remained 15 years from the date SCE committed to participate in the Wildfire Insurance Fund.\n\nEdison International and SCE will assess the Wildfire Insurance Fund contribution assets for impairment in the event that a participating utility&#39;s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire, based on the ability of SCE to benefit from the coverage provided by the Wildfire Insurance Fund in an amount equal to the recorded assets.\n\nNuclear Decommissioning and Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (&#34;ARO&#34;) is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, including a liability for the fair value of a conditional ARO, if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. When an ARO liability is initially recorded, SCE capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. For each subsequent period, the liability is increased for accretion expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.\n\nSCE has not recorded an ARO for assets that are expected to operate indefinitely or where SCE cannot estimate a settlement date (or range of potential settlement dates). As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for certain retirement activities, including certain hydroelectric facilities.\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in SCE&#39;s ARO liability:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBeginning balance\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,772 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,930 \n\nAccretion 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nRevisions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 77 )\n\nLiabilities settled\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 189 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 238 )\n\nEnding balance\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,754 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,772 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 An ARO represents the present value of a future obligation. Accretion is an increase in the liability to account for the time value of money resulting from discounting. ##TABLE_END \n\nAROs related to decommissioning of SCE&#39;s nuclear power facilities are based on site-specific studies conducted as part of each Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding (&#34;NDCTP&#34;) conducted before the CPUC. Revisions of an ARO are established for updated site-specific decommissioning cost estimates.\n\nThe ARO for decommissioning SCE&#39;s San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (&#34;San Onofre&#34;) and Palo Verde nuclear power facilities is $ 2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. The liability to decommission SCE&#39;s nuclear power facilities is based on a 2020 decommissioning study, filed as part of the 2021 NDCTP, for San Onofre Unit 1, 2 and 3 and a 2019 decommissioning study for Palo Verde, with revisions to the cost estimate in 2020. \n\nSCE records an ARO regulatory liability as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs and the recovery of costs through the ratemaking process. For further information, see Note 11.\n\nDecommissioning of San Onofre Unit 1 began in 1999 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from Unit 1 to dry cask storage in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (&#34;ISFSI&#34;) 1 was completed in 2005. Major decommissioning work for Unit 1 has been completed except for certain underground work. \n\nDecommissioning of San Onofre Units 2 and 3 began in June 2013 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from San Onofre Units 2 and 3 to dry cask storage in the two ISFSIs was completed in August 2020. In October 2019, the California Coastal Commission approved SCE&#39;s application for a Coastal Development Permit, the principal discretionary permit required to start major decommissioning activities at San Onofre Units 2 and 3. In August 2020, \n\nSCE commenced, and is currently conducting, major decommissioning activities in accordance with the terms of the permit. \n\nDecommissioning costs, which are recovered through customer rates over the term of each nuclear facility&#39;s operating license, are recorded as a component of depreciation expense, with a corresponding credit to the ARO regulatory liability. Due to regulatory recovery of SCE&#39;s nuclear decommissioning expense, prudently incurred costs for nuclear decommissioning activities do not affect SCE&#39;s earnings. Amortization of the ARO asset (included within the unamortized nuclear investment) and accretion of the ARO liability are deferred as decreases to the ARO regulatory liability account, resulting in no impact on earnings.\n\nSCE has collected in rates amounts for the future decommissioning of its nuclear assets and has placed those amounts in independent trusts. Amounts collected in rates in excess of the ARO liability are classified as regulatory liabilities.\n\nChanges in the estimated costs, timing of decommissioning or the assumptions underlying these estimates could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission. SCE currently estimates that it will spend approximately $ 6.3 billion through 2080 to decommission its nuclear facilities. This estimate is based on SCE&#39;s decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes, escalated at rates ranging from 2.3 % to 7.5 % (depending on the cost element) annually. These costs are expected to be funded from independent decommissioning trusts. SCE estimates annual after-tax earnings on the decommissioning funds of 1.6 % to 4.9 % dependent on asset class. If the assumed return on trust assets is not earned or costs escalate at higher rates, SCE expects that additional funds needed for decommissioning will be recoverable through future rates, subject to a reasonableness review. See Note 10 for further information.\n\nDue to regulatory recovery of SCE&#39;s nuclear decommissioning expense, prudently incurred costs for nuclear decommissioning activities do not affect SCE&#39;s earnings. SCE&#39;s nuclear decommissioning costs are subject to CPUC review through the triennial regulatory proceedings. SCE&#39;s nuclear decommissioning trust investments primarily consist of fixed income investments that are classified as available-for-sale and equity investments. Due to regulatory mechanisms, investment earnings and realized gains and losses have no impact on earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on decommissioning trust funds, including impairment, increase or decrease the trust assets and the related regulatory asset or liability and have no impact on electric utility revenue or decommissioning expense. SCE reviews each fixed income security for impairment on the last day of each month. If the fair value on the last day of the month is less than the amortized cost for that security, SCE impairs the disclosed amortized cost. If the fair value is greater or less than the carrying value for that security at the time of sale, SCE recognizes a related realized gain or loss, respectively.\n\nDeferred Financing Costs\n\nDebt premium, discount and issuance expenses incurred in connection with obtaining financing are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis. Under CPUC ratemaking procedures, SCE&#39;s debt reacquisition expenses are amortized over the remaining life of the reacquired debt or, if refinanced, the life of the new debt. SCE had unamortized losses on reacquired debt of $ 109 million and $ 121 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, reflected as long-term &#34;Regulatory assets&#34; in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, Edison International and SCE had debt issuance costs related to issuances of long-term debt of $ 178 million and $ 165 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 153 million and $ 143 million at December 31, 2021, respectively. These costs are recorded as an offset to long-term debt.\n\nAmortization of deferred financing costs charged to interest expense is as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nEdison International\n\n&#160;\n\nSCE\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmortization of deferred financing costs charged to interest expense\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized by Edison International and SCE when a performance obligation to transfer control of the promised goods is satisfied or when services are rendered to customers. This typically occurs when electricity is delivered to customers, which includes amounts for services rendered but unbilled at the end of a reporting period.\n\nSCE&#39;s Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nProvision of Electricity\n\nSCE principally generates revenue through supplying and delivering electricity to its customers. Rates charged to customers are based on tariff rates, approved by the CPUC and FERC. Starting with SCE&#39;s 2021 GRC, revenue will be authorized through quadrennial GRC proceedings, which are intended to provide SCE a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its CPUC-jurisdictional rate base. The CPUC sets an annual revenue requirement for the base year and the remaining three years are set by a methodology established in the GRC proceeding. Revenue was previously authorized by the CPUC in triennial GRC proceedings. As described above, SCE also earns revenue, with no return, to recover costs for power procurement, certain wildfire related expenses and other activities.\n\nRevenue is authorized by the FERC through a formula rate which is intended to provide SCE a reasonable opportunity to recover transmission capital and operating costs that are prudently incurred, including a return on its FERC-jurisdictional rate base. Under the operation of the formula rate, transmission revenue is updated to actual cost of service annually.\n\nFor SCE&#39;s electricity sales for both residential and non-residential customers, SCE satisfies the performance obligation of delivering electricity over time as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the delivered electricity.\n\nEnergy sales are typically on a month-to-month implied contract for transmission, distribution and generation services. Revenue is recognized over time as the energy is supplied and delivered to customers and the respective revenue is billed and paid on a monthly basis.\n\nCPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity sales and the price of energy procured so that SCE receives revenue equal to amounts authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies. As a result, the volume of electricity sold to customers and specific customer classes does not have a direct impact on SCE&#39;s financial results. See Note 7 for further information on SCE&#39;s revenue.\n\nSales and Use Taxes\n\nSCE bills certain sales and use taxes levied by state or local governments to its customers. Included in these sales and use taxes are franchise fees, which SCE pays to various municipalities (based on contracts with these municipalities) in order to operate within the limits of the municipality. SCE bills these franchise fees to its customers based on a CPUC-authorized rate. These franchise fees, which are required to be paid regardless of SCE&#39;s ability to collect from the customer, are accounted for on a gross basis. SCE&#39;s franchise fees billed to customers were $ 172 million, $ 147 million and $ 131 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. When SCE acts as an agent for sales and use tax, the taxes are accounted for on a net basis. Amounts billed to and collected from customers for these taxes are remitted to the taxing authorities and are not recognized as electric utility revenue.\n\nSCE&#39;s Alternative Revenue Programs\n\nThe CPUC and FERC have authorized additional, alternative revenue programs which adjust billings for the effects of broad external factors. These alternative revenue programs allow SCE to recover costs that SCE has been authorized to pass on to customers, including costs of certain operations and maintenance activities, costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs. In general, revenue is recognized for these alternative revenue programs at the time the costs are incurred. SCE begins recognizing revenues for these programs when a program has been established by an order from either the CPUC or FERC that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, the amount of revenue for the period is objectively determinable and probable of recovery and the revenue will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period.\n\nPower Purchase Agreements\n\nSCE enters into power purchase agreements (&#34;PPAs&#34;) in the normal course of business. A power purchase agreement may be considered a variable interest in a variable interest entity (&#34;VIE&#34;). If SCE is the primary beneficiary in the VIE, SCE should consolidate the VIE. None of SCE&#39;s PPAs resulted in consolidation at December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 3 for further discussion of PPAs that are considered variable interests.\n\nA PPA may also contain a lease for accounting purposes. See &#34;Leases&#34; below and Note 12 and Note 13 for further discussion of SCE&#39;s PPAs. A PPA that does not contain a lease may be classified as a derivative which is recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. These PPAs may be eligible for an election to designate as a normal purchase or sale, which is accounted for on an accrual basis as an executory contract. \n\nPPAs that do not meet the above classifications are accounted for on an accrual basis.\n\nDerivative Instruments\n\nSCE records derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value unless otherwise exempted from derivative treatment as normal purchases or sales. The normal purchases and sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business.\n\nRealized gains and losses from SCE&#39;s derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and, therefore, SCE&#39;s fair value changes have no impact on purchased power expense or earnings. SCE does not use hedge accounting for derivative transactions due to regulatory accounting treatment.\n\nWhere SCE&#39;s derivative instruments are subject to a master netting agreement and certain criteria are met, SCE presents its derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis on its consolidated balance sheets. In addition, derivative positions are offset against margin and cash collateral deposits. The results of derivative activities are recorded as part of cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 6 for further information on derivative instruments.\n\nLeases\n\nA lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified assets for a period of time in exchange for consideration. An entity controls the use when it has a right to obtain substantially all of the benefits from the use of the identified asset and has the right to direct the use of the asset. SCE determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. For all classes of underlying assets, except battery storage assets which were first contracted in 2020 and for which each component will be separately accounted for, SCE includes both the lease and non-lease components as a single component and accounts for it as a lease. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. SCE calculates and uses the rate implicit in the lease if the information is readily available or if not available, SCE uses its incremental borrowing rate in \n\ndetermining the present value of lease payments. Incremental borrowing rates are comprised of underlying risk-free rates and secured credit spreads relative to first mortgage bonds with like tenors of lease term durations. Lease right-of-use (&#34;ROU&#34;) assets are based on the liability, subject to adjustments, such as lease incentives. The ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. SCE excludes variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease liabilities, other than those that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments. SCE&#39;s lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. SCE elected to exclude from the balance sheet short-term lease contracts of one year or less.\n\nSCE enters into power purchase agreements that may contain leases. This occurs when a power purchase agreement designates a specific power plant, SCE obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the plant and has the right to direct the use of the plant. SCE also enters into a number of agreements to lease property and equipment in the normal course of business, primarily related to vehicles, office space and other equipment. See Note 13 for further discussion of SCE&#39;s contracts that are classified as operating and finance leases.\n\nEdison International Parent and Other&#39;s leases primarily relate to Edison Energy Group. The leases for Edison International Parent and Other are immaterial to Edison International.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock options, performance shares, deferred stock units and restricted stock units have been granted under Edison International&#39;s long-term incentive compensation programs. For equity awards that are settled in common stock, Edison International either issues new common stock, or uses a third party to purchase shares from the market and deliver such shares for the settlement of the awards. Stock options, performance shares, deferred stock units and restricted stock units are settled in common stock. For awards that are otherwise settled entirely in common stock, Edison International substitutes cash awards to the extent necessary to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations or government levies.\n\nStock-based compensation expense is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based on estimated fair values. For equity awards paid in common stock, fair value is determined at the grant date. For equity awards that have market conditions defined in the grants, expense is recognized based on grant date fair value if the requisite service period is fulfilled. However, with respect to the portion of the performance shares payable in common stock that are subject to financial performance conditions defined in the grants, the number of performance shares expected to be earned is subject to revision and updated at each reporting period, with a related adjustment to compensation expense.\n\nFor awards granted to retirement-eligible participants, stock compensation expense is recognized on a prorated basis over the initial year. For awards granted to participants who become eligible for retirement during the requisite service period, stock compensation expense is recognized over the period between the date of grant and the date the participant first becomes eligible for retirement. Edison International and SCE estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest rather than account for forfeitures when they occur. Share-based payments may create a permanent difference between the amount of compensation expense recognized for book and tax purposes. The tax impact of this permanent difference is recognized in earnings in the period it is created. See Note 9 for further information.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \n\nThe Edison International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#34;ESPP&#34;), effective beginning July 2021, allows eligible employees to make purchases of Edison International&#8217;s common stock. The maximum aggregate numbers of shares that may be issued under the ESPP is 3,000,000 shares. Eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of between 1 % and 10 % of their compensation, up to a maximum of $ 25,000 , to purchase shares of common stock at 97 % of the market price on the last day of each six months offering period. The ESPP is considered noncompensatory and stock issuances under the ESPP are recorded directly in equity.\n\nSCE Dividends\n\nCPUC holding company rules require that SCE&#39;s dividend policy be established by SCE&#39;s Board of Directors on the same basis as if SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE&#39;s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both Edison International and SCE. In addition, the CPUC regulates SCE&#39;s capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders.\n\nThe common equity component of SCE&#39;s CPUC authorized capital structure is 52 % on a weighted average basis over the January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025 compliance period (&#34;Capital Structure Compliance Period&#34;). This is unchanged from the January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 compliance period. The CPUC authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on GAAP due to certain exclusions allowed by CPUC, including the impact of SCE&#39;s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund under AB 1054. For further information, see &#34;Business&#8212;SCE&#8212;Overview of Ratemaking Process&#34; and &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires.&#34; \n\nIn May 2020, the CPUC issued a decision on SCE&#39;s application to the CPUC for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows SCE to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. With these exclusions, SCE was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. The temporary exclusion lapsed on May 7, 2022. In April 2022, SCE filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. Under the CPUC&#39;s rules, SCE will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. While the exclusion is in place, SCE is required to notify the CPUC if an adverse financial event reduces SCE&#39;s spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the CPUC in the proceeding. The last spot equity ratio SCE filed with the CPUC in the proceeding did not exclude the then $ 1.8 billion net charge and was 45.2 % as of December 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of SCE&#39;s CPUC authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above 48 % on a weighted average basis over the applicable 37-month period). SCE&#39;s spot equity ratio on December 31, 2018 would have been 48.7 % had the $ 1.8 billion net charge at December 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore SCE will notify the CPUC if its spot ratio drops below 47.7 % in any quarter. For further information, see &#34;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies&#8212;Southern California Wildfires and Mudslides.&#34; \n\nSCE monitors its compliance with the CPUC&#39;s equity ratio requirement based on the weighted average of the common equity component of SCE&#39;s CPUC authorized capital structure over the Capital Structure Compliance Period using its actual capital structure from the beginning of the Capital Structure Compliance Period through the reporting date together with forecasted performance and expected financing activities for the remainder of the Capital Structure Compliance Period. SCE expects to be compliant with its CPUC authorized capital structure at the end of its current compliance period, December 31, 2025. \n\nSCE&#39;s ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of its outstanding series of preference stock. For further information see Note 14.\n\nAs a California corporation, SCE&#39;s ability to pay dividends is also governed by the California General Corporation Law. California law requires that for a dividend to be declared: (a) retained earnings must equal or exceed the proposed dividend, or (b) immediately after the dividend is made, the value of the corporation&#39;s assets must exceed the value of its liabilities plus amounts required to be paid, if any, in order to liquidate stock senior to the shares receiving the dividend. Additionally, a California corporation may not declare a dividend if it is, or as a result of the dividend would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. Prior to declaring dividends, SCE&#39;s Board of Directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, to ensure \n\nthat the California law requirements for the declarations are met. On February 23, 2023, SCE declared a dividend to Edison International of $ 350 million.\n\nThe timing and amount of future dividends are also dependent on a number of other factors including SCE&#39;s requirements to fund other obligations and capital expenditures, and its ability to access the capital markets and generate operating cash flows and earnings. If SCE incurs significant costs related to catastrophic wildfires and is unable to recover such costs through insurance, the Wildfire Insurance Fund (for fires after July 12, 2019), or from customers or is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, SCE may be limited in its ability to pay future dividends to Edison International and its preference shareholders.\n\nEdison International Dividend \n\nIn December 2022, Edison International declared a 5 % increase to the annual dividend rate from $ 2.80 per share to $ 2.95 per share. On February 23, 2023, Edison International declared a dividend of $ 0.7375 per share to be paid on April 30, 2023. Edison International intends to maintain its target payout ratio of 45 % &#8211; 55 % of SCE&#39;s core earnings. \n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nEdison International computes earnings per common share (&#34;EPS&#34;) using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security. Edison International&#39;s participating securities are stock-based compensation awards, payable in common shares, which earn dividend equivalents on an equal basis with common shares once the awards are vested. See Note 9 and Note 14 for further information.\n\nEPS attributable to Edison International common shareholders was computed as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions, except per-share amounts)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBasic earnings per share:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nNet income available to common shareholders\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nBasic earnings per share\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1.61 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2.00 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1.98 \n\nDiluted earnings per share:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nNet income available to common shareholders\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nIncome impact of assumed conversions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\nNet income available to common shareholders and assumed conversions\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncremental shares from assumed conversions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAdjusted weighted average shares &#8211; diluted\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDiluted earnings per share\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1.60 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2.00 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1.98 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIn addition to the participating securities discussed above, Edison International also may award stock options, which are payable in common shares and are included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. Stock option awards to purchase 5,839,549 , 10,239,501 , and 9,066,753 shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nEdison International and SCE estimate their income taxes for each jurisdiction in which they operate. This involves estimating current period tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of \n\nitems (such as depreciation) for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nIncome tax expense includes the current tax liability from operations and the change in deferred income taxes during the year. Interest income, interest expense, and penalties associated with income taxes are generally reflected in &#34;Income tax benefit&#34; on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nEdison International&#39;s eligible subsidiaries are included in Edison International&#39;s consolidated federal income tax and combined state tax returns. Edison International has tax-allocation and payment agreements with certain of its subsidiaries. Pursuant to an income tax-allocation agreement approved by the CPUC, SCE&#39;s tax liability is computed as if it filed its federal and state income tax returns on a separate return basis.\n\nBusiness Acquisition \n\nIn October 2022, Edison Energy acquired 100 % of Alfa Energy Ltd., an international energy and sustainability consultancy based in the United Kingdom, for total consideration of $ 22 million, including the estimated fair value of contingent consideration up to 14 million British pounds ( $ 17 million U.S. dollars at December 31, 2022) that the sellers will be entitled to if certain financial thresholds are achieved after 3 years . As a result of the acquisition, Edison Energy recognized goodwill of $ 16 million, which is included in &#34;Other long-term assets&#34; on Edison International&#39;s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. \n\nNew Accounting Guidance\n\nAccounting Guidance Adopted\n\nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#34;FASB&#34;) issued an accounting standards update to require business entities that account for transactions with a government by providing additional details about the transactions and their accounting impact. Edison International and SCE have adopted this standard on January 1, 2022 using the prospective adoption approach. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s annual disclosure. \n\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to defer the original sunset date for applying the reference rate reform relief in Accounting Standards Codification (&#34;ASC&#34;) 848 to December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2022. Edison International and SCE have adopted the standard as of December 1, 2022 prospectively. SCE has certain preference stocks, for which the distributions will be payable at a floating rate referenced to the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#34;LIBOR&#34;) from 2022. Upon adoption of this standard, if contract amendments are made where LIBOR is no longer valid, SCE expects to utilize the expedients in ASC 848 through the allowed period of December 31, 2024. \n\nNote 2. Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nSCE&#39;s utility property, plant and equipment included in the consolidated balance sheets is composed of the following:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDistribution\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n32,754 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n30,821 \n\nTransmission\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n18,106 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n17,016 \n\nGeneration\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,880 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,769 \n\nGeneral plant and other\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n6,121 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n6,108 \n\nAccumulated depreciation\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 12,260 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 11,407 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n48,601 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n46,307 \n\nConstruction work in progress\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,551 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,067 \n\nNuclear fuel, at amortized cost\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal utility property, plant and equipment\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n53,274 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n50,497 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nCapitalized Software Costs\n\nSCE capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software projects to property, plant and equipment. SCE amortizes capitalized software costs ratably over the expected lives of the software, primarily ranging from 5 to 7 years and commencing upon operational use. Capitalized software costs, included in general plant and other above, was $ 2.0 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, and accumulated amortization was $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.6 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for capitalized software was $ 344 million, $ 311 million and $ 218 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, amortization expense is estimated to be $ 342 million, $ 309 million, $ 262 million, $ 190 million and $ 110 million for 2023 through 2027, respectively.\n\nJointly Owned Utility Projects\n\nSCE owns undivided interests in transmission and generating assets for which each participant provides its own financing. SCE&#39;s proportionate share of these assets is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and included in the above table. SCE&#39;s proportionate share of expenses for each project is reflected in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe following is SCE&#39;s investment in each asset as of December 31, 2022:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nConstruction\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nPlant in\n\n&#160;\n\nWork in \n\n&#160;\n\nAccumulated\n\n&#160;\n\nNuclear Fuel \n\n&#160;\n\nNet Book \n\n&#160;\n\nOwnership \n\n&#160;\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#8203; \n\nService\n\n&#8203; \n\nProgress\n\n&#8203; \n\nDepreciation\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;(at amortized cost)\n\n&#8203; \n\nValue\n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest\n\n&#160;\n\nTransmission systems:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEldorado\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 56 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n%\n\nPacific Intertie\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n( 82 )\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\nGenerating station:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nPalo Verde (nuclear)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n2,180 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n( 1,653 )\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n%\n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,885 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 1,791 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,381 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIn addition to the jointly owned assets in the table above, SCE has ownership interests in jointly owned power poles with other companies.\n\nNote 3. Variable Interest Entities\n\nA VIE is defined as a legal entity that meets one of two conditions: (1) the equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk, or (2) the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lack any of the following three characteristics: decision-making rights, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The primary beneficiary is identified as the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct the activities of the \n\nVIE that most significantly impact the entity&#39;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE. Commercial and operating activities are generally the factors that most significantly impact the economic performance of such VIEs. Commercial and operating activities include construction, operation and maintenance, fuel procurement, dispatch and compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements.\n\nVariable Interest in VIEs that are Consolidated\n\nSCE Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary, consolidated by SCE. SCE Recovery Funding LLC is a VIE and SCE is the primary beneficiary. SCE Recovery Funding LLC was formed in 2021 for the purpose of issuing and servicing securitized bonds related to SCE&#39;s AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures.\n\nIn February 2022 and 2021, SCE Recovery Funding LLC issued $ 533 million and $ 338 million of securitized bonds, respectively, and used the proceeds to acquire SCE&#39;s right, title and interest in and to non-bypassable rates and other charges to be collected from certain existing and future customers in SCE&#39;s service territory, associated with the AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures (&#34;Recovery Property&#34;), until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The securitized bonds are secured by the Recovery Property and cash collections from the non-bypassable rates and other charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to SCE. For further details, see Note 5.\n\nThe following table summarizes the impact of SCE Recovery Funding LLC on SCE&#39;s and Edison International&#39;s consolidated balance sheets.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther current assets\n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nRegulatory assets: non-current\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nRegulatory liabilities: current\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther current liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nLong-term debt 1 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 The bondholders have no recourse to SCE. Balance is net of unamortized debt issuance costs. ##TABLE_END \n\nVariable Interest in VIEs that are not Consolidated\n\nPower Purchase Agreements\n\nSCE has PPAs that are classified as variable interests in VIEs, including agreements through which SCE provides the natural gas to fuel the plants, fixed price contracts for renewable energy, and resource adequacy agreements that, upon the seller&#39;s election, include the purchase of energy at fixed prices. SCE has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since it does not control the commercial and operating activities of these entities. Since payments for capacity are the primary source of income, the most significant economic activity for these VIEs is the operation and maintenance of the power plants. \n\nAs of the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheet that relate to involvement with VIEs that are not consolidated result from amounts due under the PPAs. Under these contracts, SCE recovers the costs incurred through demonstration of compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term power procurement plans. SCE has no residual interest in the entities and has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees or other commitments associated with these contracts other than the purchase commitments described in Note 12. As a result, there is no significant potential exposure to loss to SCE from its variable \n\ninterest in these VIEs. The aggregate contracted capacity dedicated to SCE from these VIE projects was 3,907 megawatts (&#34;MW&#34;) and 3,545 MW at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the amounts that SCE paid to these projects were $ 608 million and $ 673 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are recoverable in customer rates, subject to reasonableness review.\n\nUnconsolidated Trusts of SCE\n\nSCE Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V and Trust VI were formed in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, for the exclusive purpose of issuing the 5.10 %, 5.75 %, 5.375 %, 5.45 % and 5.00 % trust preference securities, respectively (&#34;trust securities&#34;). The trusts are VIEs. SCE has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as it does not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the trusts. SCE Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V and Trust VI issued to the public trust securities in the face amounts of $ 400 million, $ 275 million, $ 325 million, $ 300 million and $ 475 million (cumulative, liquidation amounts of $ 25 per share), respectively, and $ 10,000 of common stock each to SCE. The trusts invested the proceeds of these trust securities in Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K and Series L Preference Stock issued by SCE in the principal amounts of $ 400 million, $ 275 million, $ 325 million, $ 300 million and $ 475 million (cumulative, $ 2,500 per share liquidation values), respectively, which have substantially the same payment terms as the respective trust securities.\n\nThe Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K and Series L Preference Stock and the corresponding trust securities do not have a maturity date. Upon any redemption of any shares of the Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K or Series L Preference Stock, a corresponding dollar amount of trust securities will be redeemed by the applicable trust (see Note 14 for further information). The applicable trust will make distributions at the same rate and on the same dates on the applicable series of trust securities if and when the SCE board of directors declares and makes dividend payments on the related Preference Stock. The applicable trust will use any dividends it receives on the related Preference Stock to make its corresponding distributions on the applicable series of trust securities. If SCE does not make a dividend payment to any of these trusts, SCE would be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock. SCE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of the trust securities and trust distributions, if and when SCE pays dividends on the related Preference Stock.\n\nThe Trust II, Trust III, Trust IV, Trust V and Trust VI balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, consisted of investments of $ 220 million, $ 275 million, $ 325 million, $ 300 million and $ 475 million in the Series G, Series H, Series J, Series K and Series L Preference Stock, respectively, $ 220 million, $ 275 million, $ 325 million, $ 300 million and $ 475 million of trust securities, respectively, and $ 10,000 each of common stock.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the trusts&#39; income statements:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160; \n\nTrust II\n\n&#160;\n\nTrust III\n\n&#160;\n\nTrust IV\n\n&#160;\n\nTrust V\n\n&#160;\n\nTrust VI\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nDividend income\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nDividend distributions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDividend income\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nDividend distributions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2020\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDividend income\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nDividend distributions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (referred to as an &#34;exit price&#34;). Fair value of an asset or liability considers assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about nonperformance risk. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonperformance risk was not material for Edison International and SCE.\n\nAssets and liabilities are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value.\n\nLevel 1 &#8211; The fair value of Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s Level 1 assets and liabilities is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are available at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. This level includes exchange-traded equity securities, U.S. treasury securities, mutual funds and money market funds.\n\nLevel 2 &#8211; Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s Level 2 assets and liabilities include fixed income securities, primarily consisting of U.S. government and agency bonds, municipal bonds and corporate bonds, and over-the-counter derivatives. The fair value of fixed income securities is determined using a market approach by obtaining quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument.\n\nThe fair value of SCE&#39;s over-the-counter derivative contracts is determined using an income approach. SCE uses standard pricing models to determine the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Inputs to the pricing models include forward published or posted clearing prices from an exchange (Intercontinental Exchange) for similar instruments and discount rates. A primary price source that best represents trade activity for each market is used to develop observable forward market prices in determining the fair value of these positions. Broker quotes, prices from exchanges or comparison to executed trades are used to validate and corroborate the primary price source. These price quotations reflect mid-market prices (average of bid and ask) and are obtained from sources believed to provide the most liquid market for the commodity.\n\nLevel 3 &#8211; The fair value of SCE&#39;s Level 3 assets and liabilities is determined using the income approach through various models and techniques that require significant unobservable inputs. This level includes derivative contracts that trade infrequently such as congestion revenue rights (&#34;CRRs&#34;). Edison International Parent and Other does not have any Level 3 assets and liabilities.\n\nAssumptions are made in order to value derivative contracts in which observable inputs are not available. In circumstances where fair value cannot be verified with observable market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. Modeling methodologies, inputs, and techniques are reviewed and assessed as markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available and the fair value is adjusted when it is concluded that a change in inputs or techniques would result in a new valuation that better reflects the fair value of those derivative contracts. See Note 6 for a discussion of derivative instruments.\n\nSCE \n\nThe following table sets forth assets and liabilities of SCE that were accounted for at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy:\n\n&#8203;

Equity and treasury securities are classified as Level 1 as fair value is determined by observable market prices in active or highly liquid and transparent markets. The remaining fixed income securities are classified as Level 2. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on evaluated prices that reflect significant observable market information such as reported trades, actual trade information of similar securities, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bids, offers and relevant credit information. There are no securities classified as Level 3 in the nuclear decommissioning trusts.\n\nSCE&#39;s investment policies and CPUC requirements place limitations on the types and investment grade ratings of the securities that may be held by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. These policies restrict the trust from holding alternative investments and limit the trust funds&#39; exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets. With respect to equity and fixed income securities, the trustee obtains prices from third-party pricing services which SCE is able to independently corroborate as described below. The trustee monitors prices supplied by pricing services, including reviewing prices against defined parameters&#39; tolerances and performs research and resolves variances beyond the set parameters. SCE corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources obtained by SCE&#39;s investment managers. Differences outside established thresholds are followed-up with the trustee and resolved. For each reporting period, SCE reviews the trustee determined fair value hierarchy and overrides the trustee level classification when appropriate.\n\nEdison International Parent and Other\n\nEdison International Parent and Other assets measured at fair value and classified as Level 1 consisted of equity investments of $ 5 million and $ 12 million and money market funds of $ 137 million and $ 99 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Assets measured at fair value and classified as Level 2 consisted of short-term investments of $ 2 million and $ 6 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nFair Value of Debt Recorded at Carrying Value\n\nThe carrying value and fair value of Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) are as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCarrying \n\n&#8203; \n\nFair \n\n&#8203; \n\nCarrying \n\n&#8203; \n\nFair \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\nValue 1 \n\n&#160;\n\nValue 2 \n\n&#160;\n\nValue 1 \n\n&#160;\n\nValue 2 \n\nEdison International\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n29,639 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n26,824 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n25,247 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n27,718 \n\nSCE\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n26,258 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n23,469 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n22,110 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n24,375 \n\n##TABLE_END 1 Carrying value is net of debt issuance costs.\n\n2 &#160; The fair value of Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s short-term and long-term debt is classified as Level 2 . \n\nNote 5.

Derivative Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to commodity price risk. These risks are managed in part by entering into forward commodity transactions, including options, swaps and futures. To mitigate credit risk from counterparties in the event of nonperformance, master netting agreements are used whenever possible and counterparties may be required to pledge collateral depending on the creditworthiness of each counterparty and the risk associated with the transaction.\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity price risk represents the potential impact that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular commodity. SCE&#39;s electricity price exposure arises from energy purchased from and sold to wholesale markets as a result of differences between SCE&#39;s load requirements and the amount of energy delivered from its generating facilities and PPAs. SCE&#39;s natural gas price exposure arises from natural gas purchased for the Mountainview power plants, Peaker plants and Qualifying Facilities contracts where pricing is based on a monthly natural gas index and PPAs in which SCE has agreed to provide the natural gas needed for generation, referred to as tolling arrangements.\n\nCredit and Default Risk\n\nCredit and default risk represent the potential impact that can be caused if a counterparty were to default on its contractual obligations and SCE would be exposed to spot markets for buying replacement power or selling excess power. In addition, SCE would be exposed to the risk of non-payment of accounts receivable, primarily related to the sales of excess power and realized gains on derivative instruments.\n\nCertain power and gas contracts contain master netting agreements or similar agreements, which generally allow counterparties subject to the agreement to offset amounts when certain criteria are met, such as in the event of default. The objective of netting is to reduce credit exposure. Additionally, to reduce SCE&#39;s risk exposures counterparties may be required to pledge collateral depending on the creditworthiness of each counterparty and the risk associated with the transaction.\n\nCertain power and gas contracts contain a provision that requires SCE to maintain an investment grade rating from the major credit rating agencies that have credit ratings for SCE, referred to as a credit-risk-related contingent feature. If SCE&#39;s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, SCE may be required to post additional collateral to cover derivative liabilities and the related outstanding payables. The net fair value of all derivative liabilities with these credit-risk-related contingent features was less than $ 1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, for which SCE posted collateral of $ 24 million and no collateral to its counterparties for its derivative liabilities and related outstanding payables as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered on December 31, 2022, SCE would be required to post $ 58 million of collateral, most of which is related to outstanding payables.\n\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\n\nSCE presents its derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis on its consolidated balance sheets when subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements. Derivative positions are also offset against margin and cash collateral deposits. In addition, SCE has provided collateral in the form of letters of credit.

As a result, realized gains and losses do not affect earnings, but may temporarily affect cash flows. Due to expected future recovery from customers, unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and therefore also do not affect earnings. The remaining effects of derivative activities and related regulatory offsets are reported in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nThe following table summarizes the components of SCE&#39;s economic hedging activity:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nRealized gains\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nUnrealized gains (losses)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 75 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nNotional Volumes of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe following table summarizes the notional volumes of derivatives used for SCE&#39;s economic hedging activities:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEconomic Hedges\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nUnit of\n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\nCommodity\n\n&#160;\n\nMeasure\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nElectricity options, swaps and forwards\n\n&#160;\n\nGWh\n\n&#160;\n\n1,022 \n\n&#160;\n\n1,869 \n\nNatural gas options, swaps and forwards\n\n&#160;\n\nBcf\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCongestion revenue rights\n\n&#160;\n\nGWh\n\n&#160;\n\n44,028 \n\n&#160;\n\n33,216 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNote 7.

The annual revenue requirements are comprised of authorized operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure. Also, included in earnings activities are revenue or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue and regulatory charges or disallowances. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Cost-recovery activities &#8211; representing CPUC- and FERC- authorized balancing accounts, which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs, subject to a reasonableness review or compliance with upfront standards as well as non-bypassable rates collected for SCE Recovery Funding LLC. Cost-recovery activities include rates which provide recovery, subject to a reasonableness review of, among other things, fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs), certain operation and maintenance expenses, and repayment of bonds and financing costs of SCE Recovery Funding LLC.

The amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards recognized as part of deferred income taxes includes $ 121 million and $ 223 million related to Capistrano Wind for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in Capistrano&#39;s carryforwards is primarily due to a sale of the Capistrano Wind projects consummated in the third quarter of 2022. The tax impact of the sale and cancellation of debt is approximately $ 125 million. The tax attributes not utilized as of December 31, 2022 will be available for the Edison International consolidated group to utilize in the future. When the remaining Capistrano tax attributes are used in the future by Edison International, payments will be made to those entities under a tax allocation agreement. Under the tax allocation agreement, Edison International has recorded a corresponding liability as part of other long-term liabilities related to its obligation to make payments to Capistrano Wind when these tax benefits are realized.\n\n&#8203; \n\nEffective Tax Rate\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the federal statutory income tax rate to the income tax provision:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEdison International\n\n&#8203; \n\nSCE\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome from operations before income taxes\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\nProvision for income tax at federal statutory rate of 21 %\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nIncrease (decrease) in income tax from:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nState tax, net of federal benefit\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 70 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 47 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 61 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 57 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 33 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 52 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nProperty-related\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 219 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 233 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 320 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 219 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 233 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 320 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nChange related to uncertain tax position 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 147 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 15 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 37 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 19 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nWildfire related charges 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\nAverage rate assumption method (&#34;ARAM&#34;) adjustment 3 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\nCorporate-owned life insurance cash surrender value\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 9 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 8 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 8 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 9 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 8 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 8 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nOther\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 3 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 20 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 1 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 18 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 162 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 136 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 305 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 109 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 277 )\n\n&#8203; \n\nEffective tax rate\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 24.5 )\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n( 17.2 )\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n( 53.9 )\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n( 12.9 )\n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n1.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160;\n\n( 41.7 )\n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 In 2021, Edison International and SCE recognized tax benefits related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board &#34;FTB&#34; for tax years 2007 &#8211; 2012. See further discussion in Tax Disputes below. In 2020, Edison International and SCE recognized tax expense and benefit, respectively, primarily due to the re-measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the 2010 &#8211; 2012 California state tax filings currently under audit. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 Relates to the non-tax deductible portions of the SED Agreement (as defined in Note 12). See Note 12 for further discussion under 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 In July 2021, SCE received the IRS&#39; response to its private letter ruling request, regarding the scope of the deferred tax normalization requirements and the computations required to comply with the average rate assumption method. As a result, SCE&#39;s estimate changed and a cumulative true-up of $ 87 million reduction in tax benefits was recorded in the third quarter of 2021, for the period of January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021. ##TABLE_END \n\nThe CPUC requires flow-through ratemaking treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences which reverse over time. Flow-through items reduce current authorized revenue requirements in SCE&#39;s rate cases and result in a regulatory asset for recovery of deferred income taxes in future periods. The difference between the authorized amounts as determined in SCE&#39;s rate cases, adjusted for balancing and memorandum account activities, and the recorded flow-through items also result in increases or decreases in regulatory assets with a corresponding impact on the effective tax rate to the extent that recorded deferred amounts are expected to be recovered in future rates. For further information, see Note 11.\n\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\n\nAuthoritative guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires an enterprise to recognize, in its financial statements, the best estimate of the impact of a tax position by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The guidance requires the disclosure of all unrecognized tax benefits, which includes both the reserves recorded for tax positions on filed tax returns and the unrecognized portion of affirmative claims.\n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEdison International\n\n&#8203; \n\nSCE\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBalance at January 1,\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nTax positions taken during the current year:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncreases\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nTax positions taken during a prior year:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIncreases 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nDecreases 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 21 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 118 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 20 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 20 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 29 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 22 )\n\nSettlements with taxing authorities 3 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 4 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 5 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\nBalance at December 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Edison International recorded favorable tax positions in 2020 in connection with the Edison Mission Energy bankruptcy that required a revaluation of the reserve for uncertain tax positions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 Decrease in 2021 was related to re-measurement as a result of a settlement with the FTB for tax years 2007 &#8211; 2012. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 In 2021, Edison International reached a settlement with the FTB for tax years 2007 &#8211; 2012. ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, if recognized, $ 341 million of unrecognized tax benefits would impact Edison International&#39;s effective tax rate and $ 69 million of the unrecognized tax benefits would impact SCE&#39;s effective tax rate.\n\nTax Disputes\n\nTax years that remain open for examination by the IRS and FTB are 2019 &#8211; 2021 and 2013 &#8211; 2021, respectively.\n\nAccrued Interest and Penalties\n\nThe total amount of accrued interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEdison International\n\n&#8203; \n\nSCE\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAccrued interest and penalties\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe net after-tax interest and penalties recognized in income tax (benefit) expense are:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEdison International\n\n&#8203; \n\nSCE\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNet after-tax interest and penalties tax (benefit) expense\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 41 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n( 2 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNote 9.

Employees hired by the participating companies on or after December 31, 2017 are no longer eligible to participate in the pension plan. In lieu of that, an additional non-contributory employer contribution is deposited into the Edison 401(k) Savings Plan. SCE recognizes pension expense for its nonexecutive plan as calculated by the actuarial method used for ratemaking. The expected contributions (all by the employer) for Edison International and SCE are approximately $ 35 million and $ 8 million, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2023. Annual contributions made by SCE to most of SCE&#39;s pension plans are anticipated to be recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThe funded position of Edison International&#39;s pension is sensitive to changes in market conditions. Changes in overall interest rate levels significantly affect the company&#39;s liabilities, while assets held in the various trusts established to fund Edison International&#39;s pension are affected by movements in the equity and bond markets. Due to SCE&#39;s regulatory recovery treatment, a regulatory asset is recorded equal to the unfunded status and a regulatory liability is recorded equal to the funded status. See Note 11 for further information.\n\nInformation on pension plan assets and benefit obligations for continuing and discontinued operations is shown below.\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203;

Eligibility for a company contribution toward the cost of these benefits in retirement depends on a number of factors, including the employee&#39;s years of service, age, hire date, and retirement date. Employees hired on or after December 31, 2017 are no longer eligible for retiree healthcare benefits. In lieu of those benefits, Edison International will provide a health reimbursement account of $ 200 per month available only after meeting certain age and service year requirements. Under the terms of the Edison International Welfare Benefit Plan (&#34;PBOP Plan&#34;), each participating employer (Edison International or its participating subsidiaries) is responsible for the costs and expenses of PBOP Plan benefits with respect to its employees and former employees that exceed the participants&#39; share of contributions. A participating employer may terminate the PBOP Plan benefits with respect to its employees and former employees, as may SCE (as PBOP Plan sponsor), and, accordingly, the participants&#39; PBOP Plan benefits are not vested benefits.\n\nThe expected contributions (substantially all of which are expected to be made by SCE) for PBOP benefits are $ 8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Annual contributions related to SCE employees made to SCE plans are anticipated to be recovered through CPUC-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to the total annual expense for these plans.\n\nSCE has three voluntary employees&#39; beneficiary association trusts (&#34;VEBA Trusts&#34;) that can only be used to pay for retiree health care benefits of SCE and its subsidiaries. Once funded into the VEBA Trusts, neither SCE nor Edison International can subsequently recover remaining amounts in the VEBA Trusts. Participants of the PBOP Plan do not have a beneficial interest in the VEBA Trusts. The VEBA Trust assets are sensitive to changes in market conditions. Changes in overall interest rate levels significantly affect the company&#39;s liabilities, while assets held in the various trusts established to fund Edison International&#39;s other postretirement benefits are affected by movements in the equity and bond markets. Due to SCE&#39;s regulatory recovery treatment, the funded status is offset by a regulatory liability.\n\nInformation on PBOP Plan assets and benefit obligations is shown below:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203;

Plan assets are invested using a combination of asset classes and may have active and passive investment strategies within asset classes. Target allocations for 2022 pension plan assets were 19.1 % for U.S. equities, 10.9 % for non-U.S. equities, 55 % for fixed income and 15 % for opportunistic and/or alternative investments. Target allocations for 2022 PBOP plan assets (except for Represented VEBA which is 95 % for fixed income and 5 % for U.S. and non-U.S. equities) are 44 % for U.S. and non-U.S. equities, 50 % for fixed income and 6 % for opportunistic and/or alternative investments. Edison International employs multiple investment management firms. Investment managers within each asset class cover a range of \n\ninvestment styles and approaches. Risk is managed through diversification among multiple asset classes, managers, styles and securities. Plan asset classes and individual manager performances are measured against targets. Edison International also monitors the stability of its investment managers&#39; organizations.\n\nAllowable investment types under CPUC investment guidelines include:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; United States equities: common and preferred stocks of large, medium, and small companies which are predominantly United States-based. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Non-United States equities: equity securities issued by companies domiciled outside the United States and in depository receipts which represent ownership of securities of non-United States companies. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Fixed income: fixed income securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government, non-United States governments, government agencies and instrumentalities including municipal bonds, mortgage backed securities and corporate debt obligations. A portion of the fixed income positions may be held in debt securities that are below investment grade. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Opportunistic, alternative and other investments: Opportunistic investments in short to intermediate term market opportunities. Investments may have fixed income and/or equity characteristics and may be either liquid or illiquid. Alternative investments are limited partnerships that invest in non-publicly traded entities. Other investments are diversified among multiple asset classes such as global equity, fixed income currency and commodities markets. Investments are made in liquid or illiquid instruments within and across markets. The investment returns are expected to approximate the plans&#39; expected investment returns. ##TABLE_END \n\nAsset class portfolio weights are permitted to range within plus or minus 5 %. Where approved by the fiduciary investment committee, futures contracts are used for portfolio rebalancing and to reallocate portfolio cash positions. Where authorized, a few of the plans&#39; investment managers employ limited use of derivatives, including futures contracts, options, options on futures and interest rate swaps in place of direct investment in securities to gain efficient exposure to markets. Derivatives are not used to leverage the plans or any portfolios.\n\nDetermination of the Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets\n\nThe overall expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is based on the long-term target asset allocation for plan assets and capital markets return forecasts for asset classes employed. A portion of the PBOP trust asset returns is subject to taxation, so the expected long-term rate of return for these assets is determined on an after-tax basis.\n\nCapital Markets Return Forecasts\n\nSCE&#39;s capital markets return forecast methodologies primarily use a combination of historical market data, current market conditions, proprietary forecasting expertise, complex models to develop asset class return forecasts and a building block approach. The forecasts are developed using variables such as real risk-free interest, inflation and asset class specific risk premiums. For equities, the risk premium is based on an assumed average equity risk premium of 5 % over cash. The forecasted return on private equity and opportunistic investments are estimated at a 4 % premium above public equity, reflecting a premium for higher volatility and lower liquidity. For fixed income, the risk premium is based on a comprehensive modeling of credit spreads.\n\nFair Value of Plan Assets\n\nThe PBOP Plan and the Southern California Edison Company Retirement Plan Trust assets include investments in equity securities, U.S. treasury securities, other fixed-income securities, common/collective funds, mutual funds, other investment entities, foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, and partnership/joint ventures. Equity securities, U.S. treasury securities, mutual and money market funds are classified as Level 1 as fair value is determined by observable, \n\nunadjusted quoted market prices in active or highly liquid and transparent markets. The fair value of the underlying investments in equity mutual funds are based on stock-exchange prices. The fair value of the underlying investments in fixed-income mutual funds and other fixed income securities including municipal bonds are based on evaluated prices that reflect significant observable market information such as reported trades, actual trade information of similar securities, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bids, offers and relevant credit information. Foreign exchange and interest rate contracts are classified as Level 2 because the values are based on observable prices but are not traded on an exchange. Futures contracts trade on an exchange and therefore are classified as Level 1. No investment is classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Common/collective funds and partnerships are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (&#34;NAV&#34;) and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Other investment entities are valued similarly to common/collective funds and are therefore classified as NAV. The Level 1 registered investment companies are either mutual or money market funds. The remaining funds in this category are readily redeemable and classified as NAV and are discussed further at note 8 to the pension plan trust investments table below.\n\nEdison International reviews the process/procedures of both the pricing services and the trustee to gain an understanding of the inputs/assumptions and valuation techniques used to price each asset type/class. The trustee and Edison International&#39;s validation procedures for pension and PBOP equity and fixed income securities are the same as the nuclear decommissioning trusts. For further discussion, see Note 4. The values of Level 1 mutual and money market funds are publicly quoted.

Edison International may grant stock options and other awards related to, or with a value derived from, its common stock to directors and certain employees. Options generally expire 10 years after the grant date and vest over a period of three or four years of continuous service in equal annual increments, except for awards granted to retirement-eligible participants, which vest on an accelerated basis.\n\nThe fair value for each option granted was determined as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury STRIPS (separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities) whose maturity corresponds to the option&#39;s expected term on the measurement date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of Edison International&#39;s common stock for the length of the option&#39;s expected term for 2022.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\nIncluded in SCE&#39;s regulatory assets and liabilities are regulatory balancing accounts. CPUC-authorized balancing account mechanisms require SCE to refund or recover any differences between forecasted and actual costs. The CPUC has authorized balancing accounts for specified costs or programs such as fuel, purchased power, demand-side management programs, wildfire related costs, nuclear decommissioning and public purpose programs. Certain of these balancing accounts include a return on rate base of 7.68 % in both 2022 and 2021. The CPUC authorizes the use of a balancing account to recover from or refund to customers differences in revenue resulting from actual and forecasted electricity sales. \n\nAmounts included in regulatory assets and liabilities are generally recorded with corresponding offsets to the applicable income statement accounts. \n\nRegulatory Assets\n\nSCE&#39;s regulatory assets included on the consolidated balance sheets are:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nRegulatory balancing and memorandum accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,400 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,591 \n\nPower contracts \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nOther\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal current\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,497 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,778 \n\nLong-term:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred income taxes, net of liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,178 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,770 \n\nPower contracts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nUnamortized investments, net of accumulated amortization\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nRegulatory balancing and memorandum accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,589 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,897 \n\nEnvironmental remediation\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nRecovery assets\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal long-term\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n8,181 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n7,660 \n\nTotal regulatory assets\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n10,678 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n9,438 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIn accordance with the accounting standards applicable to rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets that are probable of future recovery from customers and has recorded regulatory assets for these incremental costs \n\nat December 31, 2022. While SCE believes such costs are probable of future recovery, there is no assurance that SCE will collect all amounts currently deferred as regulatory assets.\n\nSCE&#39;s regulatory assets related to power contracts primarily represent derivative contracts that were designated as normal purchases and normal sales contracts. The liabilities for these power contracts are amortized over the remaining contract terms, approximately 1 to 4 years . For further information, see Note 1.\n\nSCE&#39;s regulatory assets related to deferred income taxes represent tax benefits passed through to customers. The CPUC requires SCE to flow through certain deferred income tax benefits to customers by reducing electricity rates, thereby deferring recovery of such amounts to future periods. Based on current regulatory ratemaking and income tax laws, SCE expects to recover its regulatory assets related to deferred income taxes over the life of the assets that give rise to the accumulated deferred income taxes, approximately from 1 to 60 years . For further information, see Note 8.\n\nSCE has long-term unamortized investments which include nuclear assets related to Palo Verde and the beyond the meter program. Nuclear assets related to Palo Verde and the beyond the meter program are expected to be recovered by 2046 and 2031, respectively, and both earned returns of 7.68 % in 2022 and 2021.\n\nSCE&#39;s net regulatory asset related to its unamortized loss on reacquired debt will be recovered over the original amortization period of the reacquired debt over periods ranging from 10 to 40 years or the life of the new issuance if the debt is refunded or refinanced.\n\nSCE&#39;s regulatory assets related to environmental remediation represent a portion of the costs incurred at certain sites that SCE is allowed to recover through customer rates. See &#34;Environmental Remediation&#34; discussed in Note 12.\n\nRecovery assets represent the balance associated with the AB 1054 Excluded Capital Expenditures Related Recovery Properties and prudently incurred financing costs securitized with issuance of the associated bond. The recovery period is until 2046, when the bonds and interest are paid in full.

The regulatory liabilities are generally expected to be refunded to customers over the lives of the assets and liabilities that gave rise to the deferred income taxes.\n\nSCE&#39;s regulatory liabilities related to recoveries in excess of ARO liabilities represents the cumulative differences between ARO expenses and amounts collected in rates primarily for the decommissioning of the SCE&#39;s nuclear generation facilities. Decommissioning costs recovered through rates are primarily placed in nuclear decommissioning trusts. This regulatory liability also represents the deferral of realized and unrealized gains and losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments. See Note 10 for further discussion.\n\nSCE&#39;s regulatory liabilities related to pension and other post-retirement plans represent the overfunded net gains and prior service costs of the plans. This amount will be refunded through rates over time to customers. See &#34;Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions&#34; discussion in Note 9.\n\nNet Regulatory Balancing and Memorandum Accounts\n\nBalancing accounts track amounts that the CPUC or FERC have authorized for recovery. Balancing account over and under collections represent differences between cash collected in current rates for specified forecasted costs and such costs that are actually incurred. Undercollections are recorded as regulatory balancing account assets. Overcollections are recorded as regulatory balancing account liabilities. With some exceptions, SCE seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis or at other designated times to recover or refund the balances recorded in its balancing accounts. Memorandum accounts are authorized to track costs for potential future recovery.\n\nRegulatory balancing and memorandum accounts that SCE does not expect to collect or refund in the next 12 months are reflected in the long-term section of the consolidated balance sheets. Regulatory balancing and memorandum accounts that do not have the right of offset are presented gross in the consolidated balance sheets. Under and over collections in balancing accounts and amounts recorded in memorandum accounts typically accrue interest based on a three-month commercial paper rate published by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe following table summarizes the significant components of regulatory balancing and memorandum accounts included in the above tables of regulatory assets and liabilities:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAsset (liability)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nEnergy resource recovery account\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,580 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nPortfolio allocation balancing account \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 73 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 183 )\n\nNew system generation balancing account\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 63 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nPublic purpose programs and energy efficiency programs\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 1,577 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 1,066 )\n\nBase revenue requirement balancing account\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,108 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nGRC wildfire mitigation balancing accounts 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nGreenhouse gas auction revenue and low carbon fuel standard revenue\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 289 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 298 )\n\nFERC balancing accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 123 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nWildfire and drought restoration accounts 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nWildfire-related memorandum accounts 3 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,168 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,456 \n\nCOVID-19-related memorandum accounts\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCustomer service re-platform memorandum account\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTax accounting memorandum account and pole loading balancing account\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nExcess bond and power charge balancing account\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n( 56 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\nOther\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 26 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 62 )\n\nAsset\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,289 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,287 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 The 2021 GRC decision approved the establishment of the vegetation management balancing account (&#34;VMBA&#34;) to track vegetation management expenses up to 115 % of amounts authorized, the Wildfire Risk Mitigation balancing account (&#34;WRMBA&#34;) to track the costs of SCE&#39;s Wildfire Covered Conductor Program up to 110 % of amounts authorized and the risk management balancing account to track the authorized costs of wildfire insurance. The amount recorded to these balancing accounts represents the difference between costs tracked in the balancing accounts and authorized revenues for those costs recorded to the base revenue requirement balancing account. If spending is less than authorized, SCE will refund those amounts to customers. If spending is within the specified threshold, if any, for each balancing account, SCE will recover those costs from customers. Amounts above the specified threshold, or above amounts authorized if a higher threshold was not established, for each balancing account may be eligible for deferral to wildfire-related memorandum accounts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 The wildfire and drought restoration accounts regulatory assets represent restoration costs that are recorded in a Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account (&#34;CEMA&#34;). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 The wildfire-related memorandum accounts regulatory assets represent wildfire-related costs that are probable of future recovery from customers, subject to a reasonableness review. The Fire Hazard Prevention Memorandum Account (&#34;FHPMA&#34;) was used to track costs related to fire safety and to implement fire prevention corrective action measures in extreme and very high fire threat areas. The Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account (&#34;WEMA&#34;) is used to track incremental wildfire insurance costs and uninsured wildfire-related financing, legal and claims costs related to the post-2018 wildfires that SCE believes are probable of recovery. See Note 12 for further details. The Wildfire Mitigation Plan Memorandum Account (&#34;WMPMA&#34;) is used to track costs incurred to implement SCE&#39;s wildfire mitigation plan that are not currently reflected in SCE&#39;s revenue requirements. The Fire Risk Mitigation Memorandum Account (&#34;FRMMA&#34;) is used to track costs related to the reduction of fire risk that are incremental to costs approved for recovery in SCE&#39;s GRCs that are not tracked in any other wildfire-related memorandum account. The balance also includes vegetation management spending in excess of the 115 % threshold for the VMBA described above. ##TABLE_END \n\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nPower Purchase Agreements\n\nSCE entered into various agreements to purchase power, electric capacity and other energy products. At December 31, 2022, the undiscounted future expected minimum payments for the SCE PPAs (primarily related to renewable energy \n\ncontracts), which were approved by the CPUC and met other critical contract provisions (including completion of major milestones for construction), were as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n3,106 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,596 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,409 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,401 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,221 \n\nThereafter\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n18,000 \n\nTotal future commitments 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n30,733 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Certain power purchase agreements are treated as operating leases. For further discussion, see Note 13. ##TABLE_END \n\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2022, SCE has executed contracts (including capacity reduction contracts) that have not met the critical contract provisions that would increase contractual obligations by $ 29 million in 2023, $ 123 million in 2024, $ 171 million in 2025, $ 182 million in 2026, $ 186 million in 2027 and $ 1,864 million thereafter, if all critical contract provisions are completed. These obligations include long-term lease contracts commencing in 2023 with total future minimum lease payments of $ 393 million.\n\nCosts incurred for PPAs were $ 5.1 billion in 2022, $ 4.7 billion in 2021 and $ 3.8 billion in 2020, which include costs associated with contracts with terms of less than one year.\n\nOther Commitments\n\nThe following summarizes the estimated minimum future commitments for SCE&#39;s other commitments:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThereafter\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\nOther contractual obligations\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nCosts incurred for other commitments were $ 58 million in 2022, $ 62 million in 2021 and $ 80 million in 2020. Other commitments include fuel supply contracts for Palo Verde which require payment only if the fuel is made available for purchase. Also included are commitments related to maintaining reliability and expanding SCE&#39;s transmission and distribution system.\n\nThe table above does not include asset retirement obligations, which are discussed in Note 1.\n\nIndemnities\n\nEdison International and SCE have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnity agreements which are issued in the normal course of business.\n\nEdison International and SCE have agreed to provide indemnifications through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These are primarily indemnifications against adverse litigation outcomes in connection with underwriting agreements, indemnities for specified environmental liabilities and income taxes with respect to assets sold or other contractual arrangements. Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s obligations under these agreements may or may not be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances Edison International and SCE may have recourse against third parties. Edison International and SCE have not recorded a liability related to these indemnities. The overall maximum amount of the obligations under these indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\nContingencies\n\nIn addition to the matters disclosed in these Notes, Edison International and SCE are involved in other legal, tax, and regulatory proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Edison International and SCE believe the outcome of each of these other proceedings will not materially affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nSouthern California Wildfires and Mudslides \n\nCalifornia has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years due to climate change and wildfires in SCE&#39;s territory, including those where SCE&#39;s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire&#39;s ignition, have caused loss of life and substantial damage in recent years. SCE&#39;s service territory remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity.\n\nNumerous claims related to wildfire events have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. Edison International and SCE have incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events (defined below), which are described below. In addition, SCE&#39;s equipment has been, and may further be, alleged to be associated with wildfires that have originated in Southern California subsequent to 2018. \n\nLiability Overview\n\nThe extent of legal liability for wildfire-related damages in actions against utilities depends on a number of factors, including whether the utility substantially caused or contributed to the damages and whether parties seeking recovery of damages will be required to show negligence in addition to causation. California courts have previously found utilities to be strictly liable for property damage along with associated interest and attorneys&#39; fees, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility&#39;s facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. If inverse condemnation is held to be inapplicable to SCE in connection with a wildfire, SCE still could be held liable for property damages and associated interest if the property damages were found to have been proximately caused by SCE&#39;s negligence. If SCE were to be found negligent, SCE could also be held liable for, among other things, fire suppression costs, business interruption losses, evacuation costs, clean-up costs, medical expenses, and personal injury/wrongful death claims. Additionally, SCE could potentially be subject to fines and penalties for alleged violations of CPUC rules and state laws investigated in connection with the ignition of a wildfire. \n\nFinal determinations of legal liability for wildfire events, including determinations of whether SCE was negligent, would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation processes and settlements may be reached before determinations of legal liability are ever made. Even when investigations are still pending or legal liability is disputed, an assessment of likely outcomes, including through future settlement of disputed claims, may require estimated losses to be accrued under accounting standards. Each reporting period, management reviews its loss estimates for remaining alleged and potential claims related to wildfire events. The process for estimating losses associated with alleged and potential wildfire related claims requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including, but not limited to: estimates of known and expected claims by third parties based on currently available information, opinions of counsel regarding litigation risk, the status of and developments in the course of litigation, and prior experience litigating and settling wildfire litigation claims. As additional information becomes available, management&#39;s estimates and assumptions regarding the causes and financial impact of wildfire events may change. Actual losses incurred may be higher or lower than estimated based on several factors, including the uncertainty in estimating damages that have been or may be alleged. \n\n2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events\n\nWildfires in SCE&#39;s territory in December 2017 and November 2018 caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for SCE customers. The investigating government agencies, the Ventura County Fire Department (&#34;VCFD&#34;) and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (&#34;CAL FIRE&#34;), have determined that the largest of the 2017 fires in SCE&#39;s territory originated on December 4, 2017, in the Anlauf Canyon area of Ventura County (the investigating agencies refer to this fire as the &#34;Thomas Fire&#34;), followed shortly thereafter by a second fire that originated near Koenigstein Road in the City of Santa Paula (the &#34;Koenigstein Fire&#34;). The December 4, 2017 fires eventually burned substantial acreage in both Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. According to CAL FIRE, the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires, collectively, burned over 280,000 acres, destroyed or damaged an estimated 1,343 structures and resulted in two confirmed fatalities. The largest of the November 2018 fires in SCE&#39;s territory, known as the &#34;Woolsey Fire,&#34; originated in Ventura County and burned acreage in both Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. According to CAL FIRE, the Woolsey Fire burned almost 100,000 acres, destroyed an estimated 1,643 structures, damaged an estimated 364 structures and resulted in three confirmed fatalities. Four additional fatalities are alleged to have been associated with the Woolsey Fire.\n\nAs described below, multiple lawsuits related to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and the Woolsey Fire have been initiated against SCE and Edison International. Some of the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires lawsuits claim that SCE and Edison International have responsibility for the damages caused by debris flows and flooding in Montecito and surrounding areas in January 2018 (the &#34;Montecito Mudslides&#34;) based on a theory alleging that SCE has responsibility for the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires and further alleging that the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused the Montecito Mudslides. According to Santa Barbara County initial reports, the Montecito Mudslides destroyed an estimated 135 structures, damaged an estimated 324 structures, and resulted in 21 confirmed fatalities, with two additional fatalities presumed. One of the presumed fatalities has been confirmed. \n\nThe Thomas Fire, the Koenigstein Fire, the Montecito Mudslides (defined below) and the Woolsey Fire are each referred to as a &#34;2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Event,&#34; and, collectively, referred to as the &#34;2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events.&#34; \n\nIn 2022, SCE accrued estimated losses of $ 1.3 billion for claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of $ 76 million. The resulting net charge to earnings was $ 1.2 billion ( $ 879 million after-tax). \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid $ 7.6 billion under executed settlements, had $ 185 million to be paid under executed settlements, including $ 120 million to be paid under the SED Agreement (as defined below), and had $ 934 million of estimated losses for remaining alleged and potential claims reflected on their consolidated balance sheets related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through FERC electric rates of $ 142 million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. \n\nThe estimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events do not include an estimate of potential losses related to certain alleged and potential claims made by the California Governor&#39;s Office of Emergency Service (&#34;Cal OES&#34;) seeking recovery on behalf of itself and 30 state and local government entities that did not pursue their own suits against SCE, but sustained damage in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and received funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#34;FEMA&#34;) that was dispersed by the Cal OES. As of the filing of this report SCE has not concluded that losses related to FEMA funds disbursed by Cal OES are probable. \n\nEdison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. Due to the number of uncertainties and \n\npossible outcomes related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation, Edison International and SCE cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred. \n\nEstimated losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation are based on a number of assumptions and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Actual losses incurred may be higher or lower than estimated based on several factors, including the uncertainty in estimating damages that have been or may be alleged. For instance, SCE will receive additional information with respect to damages claimed as the claims mediation processes progress. Other factors that can cause actual losses incurred to be higher or lower than estimated include the ability to reach settlements and the outcomes of settlements reached through the ongoing claims mediation processes, uncertainties related to the sufficiency of insurance held by plaintiffs, uncertainties related to the litigation processes, including whether plaintiffs will ultimately pursue claims, uncertainty as to the legal and factual determinations to be made during litigation, including uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, the complexities associated with fires that merge and whether inverse condemnation will be held applicable to SCE with respect to damages caused by the Montecito Mudslides, and the uncertainty as to how these factors impact future settlements.\n\nThe CPUC and FERC may not allow SCE to recover uninsured losses through electric rates if it is determined that such losses were not reasonably or prudently incurred. SCE will seek rate recovery of prudently incurred losses and related costs realized in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in excess of available insurance, other than for any obligations under the SED Agreement (as defined below). See &#34;Loss Estimates for Third Party Claims and Potential Recoveries from Insurance and through Electric Rates&#34; below for additional information.\n\nExternal Investigations and Internal Review \n\nThe VCFD and CAL FIRE have jointly issued reports concerning their findings regarding the causes of the Thomas Fire and the Koenigstein Fire. The reports did not address the causes of the Montecito Mudslides. SCE has also received a non-final redacted draft of a report from the VCFD regarding Woolsey Fire (the &#34;Redacted Woolsey Report&#34;). SCE cannot predict when the VCFD will release its final report regarding the Woolsey Fire. The VCFD and CAL FIRE findings do not determine legal causation of or assign legal liability for the Thomas, Koenigstein or Woolsey Fires; final determinations of legal causation and liability would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation. \n\nThe CPUC&#39;s Safety and Enforcement Division (&#34;SED&#34;) conducted investigations to assess SCE&#39;s compliance with applicable rules and regulations in areas impacted by the Thomas, Koenigstein and Woolsey Fires. As discussed below, in October 2021, SCE and the SED executed the SED Agreement (as defined below) to resolve the SED&#39;s investigations into the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. \n\nThe California Attorney General&#39;s Office has completed its investigation of the Thomas Fire and the Woolsey Fire without pursuing criminal charges. \n\nSCE&#39;s internal review into the facts and circumstances of each of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events is complex and time consuming. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation processes. \n\nThomas Fire\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the VCFD and CAL FIRE jointly issued a report concluding, after ruling out other possible causes, that the Thomas Fire was started by SCE power lines coming into contact during high winds, resulting in molten metal falling to the ground. However, the report does not state that their investigation found molten metal on the ground. At this time, based on available information, SCE has not determined whether its equipment caused the Thomas Fire. Based on publicly available radar data showing a smoke plume in the Anlauf Canyon area emerging in advance of the report&#39;s indicated start time, SCE believes that the Thomas Fire started at least 12 minutes prior to any issue involving SCE&#39;s \n\nsystem and at least 15 minutes prior to the start time indicated in the report. SCE is continuing to assess the extent of damages that may be attributable to the Thomas Fire. \n\nKoenigstein Fire\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the VCFD and CAL FIRE jointly issued a report finding that the Koenigstein Fire was caused when an energized SCE electrical wire separated and fell to the ground along with molten metal particles and ignited the dry vegetation below. SCE believes that its equipment was associated with the ignition of the Koenigstein Fire. SCE is continuing to assess the extent of damages that may be attributable to the Koenigstein Fire.\n\nMontecito Mudslides\n\nSCE&#39;s internal review includes inquiry into whether the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires proximately caused or contributed to the Montecito Mudslides, whether, and to what extent, the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires were responsible for the damages in the Montecito area and other factors that potentially contributed to the losses that resulted from the Montecito Mudslides. Many other factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions and insufficiently or improperly designed and maintained debris basins, roads, bridges and other channel crossings, could have proximately caused, contributed to or exacerbated the losses that resulted from the Montecito Mudslides. \n\nAt this time, based on available information, SCE has not been able to determine whether the Thomas Fire or the Koenigstein Fire, or both, were responsible for the damages in the Montecito area. In the event that SCE is determined to have caused the fire that spread to the Montecito area, SCE cannot predict whether, if fully litigated, the courts would conclude that the Montecito Mudslides were caused or contributed to by the Thomas and/or Koenigstein Fires or that SCE would be liable for some or all of the damages caused by the Montecito Mudslides. \n\nWoolsey Fire\n\nSCE&#39;s internal review into the facts and circumstances of the Woolsey Fire is ongoing. SCE has reported to the CPUC that there was an outage on SCE&#39;s electric system in the vicinity of where the Woolsey Fire reportedly began on November 8, 2018. SCE is aware of witnesses who saw fire in the vicinity of SCE&#39;s equipment at the time the fire was first reported. While SCE did not find evidence of downed electrical wires on the ground in the suspected area of origin, it observed a pole support wire in proximity to an electrical wire that was energized prior to the outage. \n\nThe Redacted Woolsey Report states that the VCFD investigation team determined that electrical equipment owned and operated by SCE was the cause of the Woolsey Fire. Absent additional evidence, SCE believes that it is likely that its equipment was associated with the ignition of the Woolsey Fire. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of CAL FIRE and others during the course of its internal review and the Woolsey Fire litigation process, including SCE equipment that has been retained by CAL FIRE. \n\nLitigation \n\nMultiple lawsuits related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events naming SCE as a defendant have been filed by three categories of plaintiffs: individual plaintiffs, subrogation plaintiffs and public entity plaintiffs. A number of the lawsuits also name Edison International as a defendant and some of the lawsuits were filed as purported class actions. The litigation could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters and number of plaintiffs.\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the Los Angeles Superior Court denied Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s challenge to the application of inverse condemnation to SCE with respect to the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and, on February 26, 2019, the California Supreme Court denied SCE&#39;s petition to review the Superior Court&#39;s decision. In April 2022, following a stipulated judgment entered against SCE in the TKM litigation, SCE filed an appeal related to inverse condemnation in the California Court of Appeal.\n\nIn January 2019, SCE filed a cross-complaint against certain local public entities alleging that failures by these entities, such as failure to adequately plan for flood hazards and build and maintain adequate debris basins, roads, bridges and other channel crossings, among other things, caused, contributed to or exacerbated the losses that resulted from the Montecito Mudslides. These cross-claims in the Montecito Mudslides litigation were not released as part of the Local Public Entity Settlements (as defined below).\n\nSettlements \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, SCE paid $ 360 million to a number of local public entities to resolve those parties&#39; collective claims arising from the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events (the &#34;Local Public Entity Settlements&#34;). \n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, Edison International and SCE entered into an agreement (the &#34;TKM Subrogation Settlement&#34;) under which all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs&#39; in the Thomas Fire, Koenigstein Fire and Montecito Mudslides litigation (the &#34;TKM Subrogation Plaintiffs&#34;) collective claims arising from the Thomas Fire, Koenigstein Fire or Montecito Mudslides have been resolved. Under the TKM Subrogation Settlement, SCE paid the TKM Subrogation Plaintiffs an aggregate of $ 1.2 billion in October 2020 and also agreed to pay $ 0.555 for each dollar in claims to be paid by the TKM Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders on or before July 15, 2023, up to an agreed upon cap.\n\nIn January 2021, Edison International and SCE entered into an agreement (the &#34;Woolsey Subrogation Settlement&#34;) under which all of the insurance subrogation plaintiffs&#39; in the Woolsey Fire litigation (the &#34;Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs&#34;) collective claims arising from the Woolsey Fire have been resolved. Under the Woolsey Subrogation Settlement, SCE paid the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs an aggregate of $ 2.2 billion in March and April 2021. SCE has also agreed to pay $ 0.67 for each dollar in claims to be paid by the Woolsey Subrogation Plaintiffs to their policy holders on or before July 15, 2023, up to an agreed upon cap.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, SCE has also entered into settlements with approximately 9,500 individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, SCE entered into settlements with individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation under which it agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately $ 300 million, $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, to those individual plaintiffs. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022 SCE entered into settlements with individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation under which it agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately $ 700 million, $ 400 million, $ 350 million and $ 280 million, respectively, to those individual plaintiffs. The statutes of limitations for individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events have expired.\n\nEdison International and SCE did not admit wrongdoing or liability as part of any of the settlements described above. Other claims and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events remain. SCE continues to explore reasonable settlement opportunities with other plaintiffs in the outstanding 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events litigation.\n\nSED Agreement \n\nIn October 2021, SCE and the SED executed an agreement (the &#34;SED Agreement&#34;) to resolve the SED&#39;s investigations into the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and three other 2017 wildfires for, among other things, aggregate costs of $ 550 million. The $ 550 million in costs comprised of a $ 110 million fine to be paid to the State of California General Fund, $ 65 million of shareholder-funded safety measures, and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery in CPUC-jurisdictional rates for $ 375 million of third-party uninsured claims payments. The SED Agreement provides that SCE may, on a permanent basis, exclude from its ratemaking capital structure any after-tax charges to equity or debt borrowed to finance costs incurred under the SED Agreement. The SED Agreement also imposes other obligations on SCE, including reporting requirements and safety-focused studies. SCE&#39;s obligations under the SED \n\nAgreement commenced on August 15, 2022, when CPUC approval of the SED Agreement became final and non-appealable. SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in the SED Agreement.\n\nLoss Estimates for Third Party Claims and Potential Recoveries from Insurance and through Electric Rates \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s balance sheets include fixed payments to be made under executed settlement agreements and accrued estimated losses of $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. The following table presents changes in estimated losses since December 31, 2021:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2021 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,734 \n\nIncrease in accrued estimated losses \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,296 \n\nAmounts paid\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 1,911 )\n\nBalance at December 31, 2022 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,119 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 At December 31, 2021, $ 131 million in current liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets consists of settlements executed in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. At December 31, 2021, the $ 1,733 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets includes Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s best estimate of expected losses for the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events of $ 1,603 million and other wildfire-related claims estimates of $ 130 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 At December 31, 2022, $ 121 million in current liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets consists of $ 65 million of settlements executed and $ 56 million of a short term payables under the SED Agreement in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. At December 31, 2022, the $ 1,687 million included in deferred credits and other liabilities, wildfire-related claims, on Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets includes Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events of $ 934 million, $ 64 million of a long term payables under the SED Agreement and other wildfire-related claims estimates of $ 689 million. ##TABLE_END \n\nFor the years-ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Edison International&#8217;s and SCE&#8217;s income statements include charges for the estimated losses, net of expected recoveries from insurance and FERC customers, related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nCharge for wildfire-related claims\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,296 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,265 \n\nExpected revenue from FERC customers\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 76 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 67 )\n\nTotal pre-tax charge\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,220 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,198 \n\nIncome tax benefit\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 341 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 304 )\n\nTotal after-tax charge\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nFor events that occurred in 2017 and early 2018, principally the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires and Montecito Mudslides, SCE had $ 1.0 billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage, subject to a self-insured retention of $ 10 million per occurrence. For the Woolsey Fire, SCE had an additional $ 1.0 billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage, subject to a self-insured retention of $ 10 million per occurrence. \n\nIn total, through December 31, 2022, SCE has accrued estimated losses of $ 8.8 billion, has paid or is obligated to pay approximately $ 7.8 billion in settlements, including $ 120 million to be paid under the SED Agreement, and has recovered $ 2.0 billion from its insurance carriers in relation to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. \n\nRecovery of SCE&#39;s losses realized in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. Under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. SCE utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. The only directly comparable precedent in which a California investor-owned utility has sought recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs is San Diego Gas &#38; Electric&#39;s (&#34;SDG&#38;E&#34;) requests for cost recovery related to 2007 wildfire activity, where the FERC allowed recovery of all FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the CPUC rejected recovery of all CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that SDG&#38;E did not meet the CPUC&#39;s prudency standard. As a result, while SCE does not agree with the CPUC&#39;s decision, it believes that the CPUC&#39;s interpretation and application of the prudency standard to SDG&#38;E creates substantial uncertainty regarding how that standard will be applied to an investor-owned utility in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to July 12, 2019. SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including judicial, legislative and regulatory decisions, including any CPUC decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard when making determinations regarding recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs. While the CPUC has not made a determination regarding SCE&#39;s prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events, SCE is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs are probable of recovery through electric rates. SCE would record a regulatory asset at the time it obtains sufficient information to support a conclusion that recovery is probable. \n\nThrough the operation of its FERC Formula Rate, and based upon the precedent established in SDG&#38;E&#39;s recovery of FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs, SCE believes it is probable it will recover its FERC-jurisdictional wildfire and mudslide related costs and has recorded total expected recoveries of $ 376 million within the FERC balancing account. This was the FERC portion of the total estimated losses accrued. As of December 31, 2022, collections have reduced the regulatory assets remaining in the FERC balancing account to $ 142 million.\n\nIn July 2019, SCE filed a CEMA application with the CPUC to seek recovery of, among other things, approximately $ 60 million of capital expenditures and capital related expenses incurred to restore service to customers and to repair, replace and restore buildings and SCE&#39;s facilities damaged or destroyed as a result of six 2017 fires, primarily the Thomas and Koenigstein Fires. In August 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision which denied without prejudice SCE&#39;s application to recover a revenue requirement of $ 8 million for all six 2017 wildfires on the basis that SCE did not demonstrate that it was prudent in relation to the Thomas and Rye fires and had failed to segregate the costs attributable to the other four fires. Of the $ 8 million revenue requirement that was denied, $ 6 million was for the Thomas and Rye fires. CAL FIRE has determined that the Thomas and Rye fires were caused by SCE equipment. The decision allows SCE to submit additional applications with the CPUC to recover the costs associated with the Thomas and Rye fires, does not specify a deadline for any such applications, and directs that SCE must prove it was prudent in relation to the Thomas and/or Rye fires, as applicable, in any such future applications. As required by the final decision with respect to the other four fires, SCE filed supplemental testimony in November 2021 segregating the restoration costs attributable to each such fire. In June 2022, the CPUC approved SCE&#39;s entire request with respect to the other four fires. As of December 31, 2022, SCE has $ 177 million in assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in relation to restoration costs related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events which may not be recoverable. These assets would be impaired if the restoration costs are permanently disallowed by the CPUC in future cost recovery proceedings. SCE expects to seek to recover costs incurred for reconstructing its system and restoring service to structures that were damaged or destroyed by the Thomas, Koenigstein and Woolsey Fires in future applications with the CPUC. \n\nPost-2018 Wildfires\n\nSeveral wildfires have significantly impacted portions of SCE&#39;s service territory after 2018 (the wildfires that originated in Southern California after 2018 where SCE&#39;s equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire&#39;s ignition are referred to collectively as the &#34;Post-2018 Wildfires&#34;). \n\nIn 2022, SCE accrued estimated losses of $ 572 million for claims related to the Post-2018 Wildfires, against which SCE has recorded expected recoveries from insurance of $ 399 million and expected recoveries through electric rates of $ 162 million. The resulting net charge to earnings was $ 11 million ( $ 8 million after-tax). \n\nThrough December 31, 2022, SCE has recorded total estimated losses (established at the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses) of $ 696 million, and expected recoveries from insurance of $ 473 million and expected recoveries through electric rates of $ 166 million related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. The after-tax net charges to earnings recorded through December 31, 2022 have been $ 41 million . Expected recoveries from insurance recorded for the Post-2018 Wildfires are supported by SCE&#8217;s insurance coverage for multiple policy years. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, SCE had paid $ 13 million under executed settlements related to the Post-2018 Wildfires. After giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through December 31, 2022, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s estimated losses (established at the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses) for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the Post-2018 Wildfires was $ 682 million. As of the same date, SCE had assets for expected recoveries through insurance of $ 473 million and through electric rates of $ 166 million on their consolidated balance sheets related to the Post-2018 Wildfires.\n\nExpected recoveries from insurance recorded for the Post-2018 Wildfires are supported by SCE&#39;s insurance coverage for multiple policy years. While Edison International and SCE may incur material losses in excess of the amounts accrued for certain of the Post-2018 Wildfires, Edison International and SCE expect that any losses incurred in connection with any such fire will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, and expect that any such losses after expected recoveries from insurance and through electric rates will not be material.\n\n2019 Saddle Ridge Fire \n\nThe &#34;Saddle Ridge Fire,&#34; originated in Los Angeles County in October 2019 and burned approximately 9,000 acres, destroyed an estimated 19 structures, damaged an estimated 88 structures, and resulted in one fatality and injuries to 8 fire fighters. In an unsigned and undated report that SCE received in December 2022, the Los Angeles Fire Department stated with respect to the Saddle Ridge Fire that the cause of ignition was unintentional, the form of heat was undetermined, the item first ignited was undetermined and the material type first ignited was undetermined. The Los Angeles Fire Department report noted that no other competent ignition sources other than SCE&#8217;s transmission lines were found in the specific origin area of the Saddle Ridge Fire. SCE has been advised that the Los Angeles Fire Department investigation of the Saddle Ridge Fire remains open. Based on pending litigation and without considering insurance recoveries, it is reasonably possible that SCE will incur a material loss in connection with the Saddle Ridge Fire, but the range of reasonably possible losses that could be incurred cannot be estimated at this time. SCE has not accrued a charge for potential losses relating to the Saddle Ridge Fire.\n\n2020 Bobcat Fire \n\nThe &#34;Bobcat Fire&#34; was reported in the vicinity of Cogswell Dam in Los Angeles County in September 2020. The United States Forest Service (&#34;USFS&#34;) has reported that the Bobcat Fire burned approximately 116,000 acres in Los Angeles County, destroyed an estimated 87 homes, 1 commercial property and 83 minor structures, damaged an estimated 28 homes and 19 minor structures, and resulted in injuries to 6 firefighters. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at $ 80 million. While SCE&#8217;s investigation remains ongoing, SCE&#8217;s information reflects that a camera in the vicinity of Cogswell Dam captured the initial stages of a fire with the first observed smoke approximately six minutes before a SCE circuit in the area experienced an anomaly (a relay). An investigation into the cause of the Bobcat Fire is being led by the USFS, and the USFS has taken a specific section of an SCE overhead conductor in the vicinity of Cogswell Dam into possession as part of its investigation. SCE understands that the USFS has also taken three tree branches in the area into possession. The SED is also conducting an investigation of the Bobcat Fire. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal \n\nreviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued material charges for potential losses relating to the Bobcat Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Bobcat Fire and is subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred.\n\n2022 Coastal Fire \n\nThe &#34;Coastal Fire&#34; originated in Orange County in May 2022 and burned approximately 200 acres. The Orange County Fire Authority (&#34;OCFA&#34;) has reported that the Coastal Fire destroyed 20 residential structures and damaged 11 residential structures. Two firefighters also reportedly sustained minor injuries. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at approximately $ 3 million. While SCE&#39;s investigation remains ongoing, SCE&#39;s information reflects that a SCE circuit in the area experienced an anomaly (a relay) approximately 2 minutes prior to the reported time of the fire. An investigation into the cause of the Coastal Fire is being led by the OCFA. The OCFA has retained SCE equipment in connection with its investigation. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued material charges for potential losses relating to the Coastal Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Coastal Fire and is subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred.\n\n2022 Fairview Fire \n\nThe &#34;Fairview Fire&#34; originated in Riverside County in September 2022 and burned approximately 28,000 acres. CAL FIRE has reported that the Fairview Fire destroyed 22 residential structures, damaged 5 residential structures, and destroyed or damaged 17 minor structures. CAL FIRE also reported 2 civilian fatalities, 1 civilian injury and 2 injuries to responding fire personnel. In addition, fire authorities have estimated suppression costs at $ 39 million. While SCE&#39;s investigation remains ongoing, SCE&#39;s information reflects that a SCE circuit in the area experienced an anomaly (relay) approximately 8 minutes prior to the reported start time of the fire. An investigation into the cause of the Fairview Fire is being led by the CAL FIRE. CAL FIRE has retained SCE equipment in connection with its investigation. SCE expects to obtain and review additional information and materials in the possession of third parties during the course of its internal reviews and the litigation process. SCE has accrued material charges for potential losses relating to the Fairview Fire. The accrued charges correspond to the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred in connection with the Fairview Fire and is subject to change as additional information becomes available. While Edison International and SCE may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued, they cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred.\n\nLoss Estimates for Third Party Claims and Potential Recoveries from Insurance and through Electric Rates \n\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets include accrued estimated losses of $ 682 million and $ 123 million, respectively, for the Post-2018 Wildfires. \n\nThe following table presents changes in estimated losses since December 31, 2021:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nIncrease in accrued estimated losses \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nAmounts paid\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 13 )\n\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nFor the years-ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s income statements include charges for the estimated losses, net of expected recoveries from insurance and customers, related to the Post-2018 Wildfires as follows, respectively:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nEdison International: \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCharge for wildfire-related claims 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nExpected insurance recoveries 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 390 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\nExpected revenue from CPUC and FERC customers\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 162 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\nTotal pre-tax charge\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 6 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 2 )\n\nTotal after-tax charge\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYears ended December 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nSCE:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCharge for wildfire-related claims 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nExpected insurance recoveries\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 399 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\nExpected revenue from CPUC and FERC customers\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 162 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212;\n\nTotal pre-tax charge\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome tax benefit\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 3 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 2 )\n\nTotal after-tax charge\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Includes estimated co-insurance payments recorded as operations and maintenance expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 In the third quarter of 2022. Edison Insurance Services, Inc. (&#34;EIS&#34;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edison International, paid $ 9 million insurance, which was included in the insurance recovery of SCE but was excluded in Edison International. ##TABLE_END \n\nRecovery of SCE&#39;s losses realized in connection with the Post-2018 Wildfires in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. The CPUC and FERC may not allow SCE to recover uninsured losses through electric rates if it is determined that such losses were not reasonably or prudently incurred. Under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, SCE defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. SCE utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. As discussed above, there is evidence of a California investor-owned utility seeking recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs and FERC allowing recovery of all FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the CPUC rejected recovery of all CPUC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that the utility did not meet the CPUC&#39;s prudency standard. This evidence was prior to the adoption of AB 1054 on July 12, 2019, after which date AB 1054 clarified that the CPUC must find a utility to be prudent if the utility&#39;s conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. Further, utilities with a valid safety certification at the time of the relevant wildfire will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the utility&#39;s conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to prove its conduct was prudent. Each of the Post-2018 Wildfires was ignited after July 12, 2019, and SCE has held a valid safety certificate since July 15, 2019. While a California investor-owned utility has not yet sought recovery for uninsured claims and other costs related to wildfires ignited after the adoption of AB 1054 , SCE believes that for fires ignited after July 12, 2019, and investor-owned utilities holding a safety certificate at the time of the fire, the CPUC will apply a standard of review similar to that applied by the FERC which presumes all costs requested by an investor-owned utility are reasonable and prudent unless serious doubt as to \n\nthe reasonableness of the utility&#8217;s conduct is raised. As such, SCE has concluded , at this time, that both uninsured CPUC-jurisdictional and uninsured FERC-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the Post-2018 Wildfires, other than for those already authorized for inclusion in electric rates, are probable of recovery through electric rates. As of December 31, 2022, SCE has recorded total expected recoveries related to the Post-2018 Wildfires of $ 152 million within the WEMA and risk management balancing account and $ 14 million within the FERC balancing account. SCE will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including regulatory decisions, including any CPUC decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard under AB 1054, and, for each applicable fire, evidence that could cast serious doubt as to the reasonableness of SCE&#39;s conduct relative to that fire.\n\nWildfire Insurance Coverage\n\nSCE has approximately $ 1.0 billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage for events that may occur during the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023, subject to up to $ 100 million of self-insured retention and co-insurance per fire, which results in aggregate net coverage of approximately $ 937 million. Of this coverage, approximately $ 102 million is provided by EIS and approximately $ 835 million is provided by other commercial insurance carriers (commercial insurance carriers other than EIS are referred to herein as &#34;Third-Party Commercial Insurers&#34;). SCE has approximately $ 1.0 billion of wildfire-specific insurance coverage for events that occurred during the period July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, subject to up to $ 100 million of self-insured retention and co-insurance per fire, as well as additional co-insurance of up to $ 63 million for the policy year, which resulted in net coverage of approximately $ 875 million provided by Third-Party Commercial Insurers and $ 28 million provided by EIS for part of the policy year.\n\nSCE believes that its insurance coverage for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 period meets its obligation to maintain reasonable insurance coverage under AB 1054. Edison International and SCE record a receivable for insurance recoveries when recovery of a recorded loss is determined to be probable.\n\nSCE&#39;s wildfire insurance expense for the July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy period will be approximately $ 450 million, of which $ 357 million is paid to Third-Party Commercial Insurers. SCE&#39;s wildfire insurance expense for the July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 policy period was approximately $ 437 million, of which $ 413 million was paid to Third-Party Commercial Insurers. The difference between the Third-Party Commercial Insurer cost and total cost in both policy years was paid in premiums to EIS. Wildfire insurance premiums paid for the July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 policy periods are being recovered through customer rates. See Note 18 for further information.\n\nWhile SCE&#39;s cost of obtaining wildfire insurance coverage from Third-Party Commercial Insurers was lower in 2022 compared to 2021, SCE&#39;s cost of obtaining wildfire insurance coverage in recent years is significantly higher than costs incurred prior to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events due to, among other things, the number of significant wildfire events throughout California and the application of inverse condemnation to investor-owned utilities. While SCE is required to maintain reasonable insurance coverage under AB 1054, SCE may not be able to obtain a reasonable amount of wildfire insurance, at a reasonable cost, from Third-Party Commercial Insurers for future policy periods.\n\nEnvironmental Remediation\n\nSCE records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and/or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated. SCE reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly, by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. These estimates include costs for site investigations, remediation, operation and maintenance, monitoring and site closure. Unless there is a single probable \n\namount, SCE records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs (reflected in &#34;Other long-term liabilities&#34;) at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, SCE&#39;s recorded estimated minimum liability to remediate its 26 identified material sites (sites with a liability balance as of December 31, 2022, in which the upper end of the range of the costs is at least $ 1 million) was $ 256 million, including $ 164 million related to San Onofre. In addition to these sites, SCE also has 15 immaterial sites with a liability balance on December 31, 2022 for which the total minimum recorded liability was $ 3 million. Of the $ 259 million total environmental remediation liability for SCE, $ 241 million has been recorded as a regulatory asset. SCE expects to recover $ 37 million through an incentive mechanism that allows SCE to recover 90 % of its environmental remediation costs at certain sites (SCE may request to include additional sites in this mechanism), and $ 204 million through proceedings that allow SCE to recover up to 100 % of the costs incurred at certain sites through customer rates. SCE&#39;s identified sites include several sites for which there is a lack of currently available information, including the nature and magnitude of contamination, and the extent, if any, that SCE may be held responsible for contributing to any costs incurred for remediating these sites. Thus, no reasonable estimate of cleanup costs can be made for these sites.\n\nThe ultimate costs to clean up SCE&#39;s identified sites may vary from its recorded liability due to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, such as: the extent and nature of contamination; the scarcity of reliable data for identified sites; the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods; developments resulting from investigatory studies; the possibility of identifying additional sites; and the time periods over which site remediation is expected to occur. SCE believes that, due to these uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that cleanup costs at the identified material sites and immaterial sites could exceed its recorded liability by up to $ 121 million and $ 9 million, respectively. The upper limit of this range of costs was estimated using assumptions least favorable to SCE among a range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\nSCE expects to clean up and mitigate its identified sites over a period of up to 40 years. Remediation costs for each of the next 5 years are expected to range from $ 9 million to $ 28 million. Costs incurred for years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 7 million, $ 9 million and $ 7 million, respectively, and were included in the &#34;Operation and maintenance&#34; expense on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nBased upon the CPUC&#39;s regulatory treatment of environmental remediation costs incurred at SCE, SCE believes that costs ultimately recorded will not materially affect its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. There can be no assurance, however, that future developments, including additional information about existing sites or the identification of new sites, will not require material revisions to estimates.\n\nNuclear Insurance\n\nFederal law limits public offsite liability claims for bodily injury and property damage from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately $ 13.7 billion for Palo Verde and $ 560 million for San Onofre. As of January 1, 2021, SCE and other owners of San Onofre and Palo Verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available ($ 450 million) through a Facility Form issued by American Nuclear Insurers (&#34;ANI&#34;). In the case of San Onofre, the balance is covered by a US Government indemnity. In the case of Palo Verde, the balance is covered by a loss sharing program among nuclear reactor licensees. If a nuclear incident at any licensed reactor in the United States, which is participating in the loss sharing program, results in claims and/or costs which exceed the primary insurance at that plant site, all participating nuclear reactor licensees could be required to contribute their share of the liability in the form of a deferred premium.\n\nThe ANI Facility Form coverage includes broad liability protection for bodily injury or offsite property damage caused by the nuclear energy hazard at San Onofre or Palo Verde, or while radioactive material is in transit to or from San Onofre or Palo Verde. The Facility Form, however, includes several exclusions. First, it excludes onsite property damage \n\nto the nuclear facility itself and onsite cleanup costs, but as discussed below SCE maintains separate Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (&#34;NEIL&#34;) property damage coverage for such events. Second, tort claims of onsite workers are excluded, but SCE also maintains an ANI Master Worker Form policy that provides coverage for non-licensee workers. This program provides a shared industry aggregate limit of $ 450 million. Industry losses covered by this program could reduce limits available to SCE. Third, offsite environmental costs arising out of government orders or directives, including those issued under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA, are excluded, with minor exceptions from clearly identifiable accidents.\n\nSCE withdrew from participation in the secondary insurance pool for San Onofre for offsite liability insurance effective January 5, 2018. Based on its ownership interests in Palo Verde, SCE could be required to pay a maximum of approximately $ 65 million per nuclear incident for future incidents. However, it would have to pay no more than approximately $ 10 million per future incident in any one year. SCE could be required to pay a maximum of approximately $ 255 million per nuclear incident and a maximum of $ 38 million per year per incident for liabilities arising from events prior to January 5, 2018, although SCE is not aware of any such events. If the public liability limit above is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by Congress. This could include an additional assessment on all licensed reactor operators as a measure for raising further federal revenue.\n\nSCE is a member of NEIL, a mutual insurance company owned by entities with nuclear facilities. NEIL provides insurance for nuclear property damage, including damages caused by acts of terrorism up to specified limits, and for accidental outages for active facilities. The amount of nuclear property damage insurance purchased for San Onofre and Palo Verde exceeds the minimum federal requirement of $ 50 million and $ 1.1 billion, respectively. These policies include coverage for decontamination liability. Additional outage insurance covers part of replacement power expenses during an accident-related nuclear unit outage. The accidental outage insurance at San Onofre has been canceled as a result of the permanent retirement, but that insurance continues to be in effect at Palo Verde.\n\nIf NEIL losses at any nuclear facility covered by the arrangement were to exceed the accumulated funds for these insurance programs, SCE could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments of up to approximately $ 30 million per year. Insurance premiums are charged to operating expense.\n\nNote 13. Leases\n\nLeases as Lessee\n\nSCE enters into various agreements to purchase power, electric capacity and other energy products that may be accounted for as leases when SCE has dispatch rights that determine when and how a plant runs. SCE also leases property and equipment primarily related to vehicles, office space and other equipment. The terms of the lease contracts included in the table below are primarily 2 to 20 years for PPA leases, 3 to 72 years for office leases, and 5 to 13 years for the remaining other operating leases. Finance leases are immaterial to the periods presented.\n\nThe following table summarizes SCE&#39;s future lease payments for operating leases as of December 31, 2022:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nPPA Operating\n\n&#8203; \n\nOther Operating\n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\nLeases 1 \n\n&#160;\n\nLeases 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2024\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2025\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2026\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2027\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nThereafter\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal lease payments\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,416 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nAmount representing interest\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nLease liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,189 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Excludes expected purchases from most renewable energy contracts, which do not meet the definition of a lease payment since renewable power generation is contingent on external factors. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 Excludes escalation clauses based on consumer price or other indices and residual value guarantees that are not considered probable at the commencement date of the lease. ##TABLE_END \n\nThe timing of SCE&#39;s recognition of the lease expense conforms to ratemaking treatment for SCE&#39;s recovery of the cost of electricity and is included in purchased power for operating leases.

Equity\n\nCommon Stock Issuances\n\nEdison International continued to settle its ongoing common stock requirements of various internal programs through issuance of new common stock. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 1,253,049 shares of common stock were issued as stock compensation awards for net cash receipts of $ 57 million, 273,642 shares of new common stock were issued in lieu of distributing $ 18 million to shareholders opting to receive dividend payments in the form of additional common stock, 157,000 shares of common stock were purchased by employees through the 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for net cash receipts of $ 10 million as dividend payments, 109,750 shares of common stock were issued related to optional cash investments of $ 7 million and 36,912 shares of common stock were issued to employees through the ESPP for net cash receipts of $ 2 million . \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 629,092 shares of common stock were issued as stock compensation awards for net cash receipts of $ 25 million, 522,400 shares of common stock were purchased by employees through the 401(k) defined contribution savings plan for net cash receipts of $ 30 million, 293,031 shares of new common stock were issued in lieu of distributing $ 17 million to shareholders opting to receive dividend payments in the form of additional common stock and 26,475 shares of common stock were issued related to optional cash investments of $ 2 million . Starting July 2021, the 401(k) defined contribution savings plan no longer offered Edison International&#39;s stock as an investment option to employees. Subsequent to the change, stock issued through the 401(k) defined contribution savings plan were dividend payments made in the form of additional common stock. \n\nAt-the-Market Program\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, Edison International filed a prospectus supplement and executed several distribution agreements with certain sales agents to establish an &#34;at-the-market&#34;(&#34;ATM&#34;) program under which it may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $ 500 million. As of December 31, 2022, no sales had occurred and Edison International has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available under the ATM program. \n\nPreferred Stock Issuances \n\nIn 2021, Edison International issued 1,250,000 shares of 5.375 % Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and 750,000 shares of its 5.00 % Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, each with a liquidation value of $ 1,000 per share. The dividends are payable on a semi-annual basis, commencing September 15, 2021 and March 15, 2022, respectively. The dividend rate will be reset every five years beginning on March 15, 2026 and March 15, 2027, respectively, to equal the then-current five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of 4.698 % and 3.901 %, respectively. The net proceeds of $ 2.0 billion were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes, including making a total of $ 900 million equity contributions to SCE.\n\nEdison International may, at its option, redeem its preferred stock in whole or in part during certain periods of time prior to each of the dividend reset dates at a price equal to $ 1,000 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. Edison International may also, at its option, redeem the preferred stocks in whole but not in part at a price equal to $ 1,020 per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends within a certain period of time following any change in the criteria rating agencies use that would have adverse effects on the equity credit attributed by rating agencies to the preferred stocks. \n\nThe preferred stocks rank senior to Edison International&#39;s common stock with respect to dividends rights and distribution rights upon liquidation. The preferred stocks are not subject to any mandatory sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or other similar provisions. Holders of the shares of the preferred stocks do not have the right to require Edison International to repurchase or redeem shares of the preferred stocks.\n\nPreferred and Preference Stock of Utility\n\nSCE&#39;s authorized shares are: $ 100 cumulative preferred &#8211; 12 million shares, $ 25 cumulative preferred &#8211; 24 million shares and preference with no par value &#8211; 50 million shares. There are no dividends in arrears for the preferred or preference shares.\n\nDuring 2020, SCE redeemed $ 120 million of cumulative preferred stock consisting of all of the outstanding shares of the 4.32 % Series, 4.08 % Series, 4.24 % Series and the 4.78 % Series at a price of $ 28.75 , $ 25.50 , $ 25.80 and $ 25.80 , respectively. SCE recorded a $ 9 million loss on the redemption of the preferred stock as an adjustment to net income available to common stockholders. No preferred shares were issued or redeemed in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Accrued capital expenditures will be included as an investing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flow in the period paid.\n\nNote 18. Related-Party Transactions\n\nEdison International and SCE provide and receive various services to and from its subsidiaries and affiliates. Services provided to Edison International by SCE are priced at fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead cost). Specified administrative services performed by Edison International or SCE employees, such as payroll and employee benefit programs, are shared among all affiliates of Edison International. Costs are allocated based on one of the following formulas: percentage of time worked, equity in investment and advances, number of employees, or multi-factor (operating revenue, operating expenses, total assets and number of employees). Edison International allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to SCE and other subsidiaries using established allocation factors.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, SCE purchased wildfire liability insurance for premiums of $ 273 million, $ 185 million, and $ 176 million respectively, from Edison Insurance Services, Inc. (&#34;EIS&#34;), a wholly-\n\nowned subsidiary of Edison International. EIS fully reinsured the exposure for these policies through the commercial reinsurance market, with reinsurance limits and premiums equal to those of the insurance purchased by SCE, except for a contract for a premium of $ 93 million for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023 under which EIS provided insurance protection to SCE. SCE recorded the premium as insurance expense and recorded an equal amount of revenue due to customer funding through regulatory cost recovery mechanisms, therefore there was no earnings impact on SCE&#39;s consolidated statements of income. EIS recorded the premium as insurance revenue. On the Edison International consolidated statements of income, the EIS insurance revenue is eliminated with SCE&#39;s insurance expense, therefore the SCE customer revenues increased the earnings of Edison International.\n\nThe related-party transactions included in SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets for wildfire-related insurance purchased from EIS and related expected insurance recoveries were as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n(in millions)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPrepaid insurance 1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\nLong-term insurance receivable due from affiliate\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Reflected in &#34;Prepaid expenses&#34; on SCE&#39;s consolidated balance sheets. ##TABLE_END \n\nThe expense for wildfire-related insurance premiums paid to EIS were $ 213 million, $ 192 million, and $ 189 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\n"

In addition, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Edison International and SCE in the reports that Edison International and SCE file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s management, including Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nManagement&#39;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s respective management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), for Edison International and its subsidiaries and SCE, respectively. Under the supervision and with the participation of their respective principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their respective internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on their evaluations under the COSO framework, Edison \n\nInternational&#39;s and SCE&#39;s respective management concluded that Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s respective internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. Edison International&#39;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this filing, which is incorporated herein by this reference. This annual report does not include an attestation report of SCE&#39;s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management&#39;s report for SCE is not subject to attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in Edison International&#39;s or SCE&#39;s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Edison International&#39;s or SCE&#39;s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nJointly Owned Utility Plant\n\nEdison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s respective scope of evaluation of internal control over financial reporting includes their Jointly Owned Utility Projects.\n\n"

SCE serves approximately 5 million customers in its service area. SCE&#39;s total number of customers by class were as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in thousands)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nResidential\n\n&#160;\n\n4,541 \n\n&#160;\n\n4,499 \n\n&#160;\n\n4,531 \n\nCommercial\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIndustrial\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPublic authorities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAgricultural and other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n5,244 \n\n&#160;\n\n5,201 \n\n&#160;\n\n5,183 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIn 2022, SCE&#39;s total operating revenue of $17.2 billion was derived as follows: 41.9% commercial customers, 39.9% residential customers, 4.0% public authorities, 3.0% industrial customers, 4.0% agricultural and other, and 7.2% other operating revenue.\n\nCPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity sales and the price of energy procured so that SCE has the opportunity to receive revenue equal to amounts authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies. As a result, the volume of electricity sold to customers does not have a direct impact on SCE&#39;s financial results. See &#34;SCE&#8212;Overview of Ratemaking Process&#8212;CPUC&#34; and &#34;&#8212;FERC&#34; for further information.\n\nEdison Energy &#8211; Energy Service Provider\n\nEdison Energy which is engaged in the competitive business of providing decarbonization and energy solutions to commercial, institutional and industrial customers in North America and Europe. Edison Energy aims to provide energy solutions that address cost, carbon and complex choices for their customers. To date, investments in Edison Energy are not material to be reported as a business segment.\n\nRegulation of Edison International as a Holding Company\n\nAs a public utility holding company, Edison International is subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Public Utility Holding Company Act primarily obligates Edison International and its utility subsidiaries to provide access to their books and records to the FERC and the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. \n\nEdison International is not a public utility and its capital structure is not regulated by the CPUC. The 1988 CPUC decision authorizing SCE to reorganize into a holding company structure, however, imposed certain obligations on Edison International and its affiliates. These obligations include a requirement that SCE&#39;s dividend policy continue to be established by SCE&#39;s Board of Directors as though SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE&#39;s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of Edison International and SCE. The CPUC has also promulgated Affiliate Transaction Rules, which, among other requirements, prohibit holding companies from (1) being used as a conduit to provide non-public information to a utility&#39;s affiliates and (2) causing or abetting a utility&#39;s violation of the rules, including providing preferential treatment to its affiliates. \n\nHuman Capital\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Edison International had an aggregate of 13,388 employees (excluding interns and employees on leaves of absence), of which 12,831 were full-time employees of SCE or its subsidiaries. In addition to employees, SCE&#39;s workforce includes a significant number of contract workers who support SCE&#39;s operations. Among these contract \n\nworkers are Safety Tier 1 Contractors. SCE estimates, based on contractors&#39; self-reported hours worked and a 2,080-hour work year, that there were approximately 10,000 full-time equivalent Safety Tier 1 Contractors supporting SCE operations (other than for decommissioning activities at San Onofre) during 2022. All Safety Tier 1 Contractors engaged in decommissioning activities at San Onofre are managed by the DGC. In addition to Safety Tier 1 Contractors, SCE also uses other contract workers to support its transmission and distribution, vegetation management, information technology and customer service activities.\n\nApproximately 3,900 of SCE&#39;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (&#34;IBEW&#34;). In February 2023, the IBEW membership ratified new collective bargaining agreements for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. In addition, a substantial number of SCE&#39;s contract workers are also unionized.\n\nEdison International focuses on various human capital measures and objectives in managing its business, including measures and objectives related to safety, diversity, equity and inclusion and workforce continuity.\n\nSafety \n\nSafety is the first of Edison International&#39;s core values. Edison International is committed to building and maintaining a safe environment for its employees, contract workers, customers and the public. Over the past several years, Edison International&#39;s efforts to improve workforce safety have included increased focus on, and investment in, maturing a culture of safety ownership among its workforce that empowers employees and contract workers to own their safety, support their team members&#39; safety and contribute to a safe work environment.\n\nEdison International makes efforts to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries and reduce all injuries. For instance, all full-time employees are provided with regular safety-related training, particularly for those who work in proximity to high-voltage electrical equipment and other high-risk activities. SCE implemented more safety requirements for both prime contractors and subcontractors in 2021 and continues to prioritize safety. \n\nEdison International uses employee safety culture assessments to measure its progress relative to improving its safety culture. Edison International also uses various measures to assess safety performance, including, without limitation, fatalities and serious injury rates for employees and contract workers. The following represents data for 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nEmployee work-related fatalities 1 \n\nEmployee EEI Serious Injuries 1 \n\nEmployee EEI SIF Rate 1,2 \n\n0.087\n\nEmployee DART Rate 1,3 \n\n1.16\n\nSafety Tier 1 Contractor work-related fatalities 4 \n\nSafety Tier 1 Contractor EEI Serious Injuries 4 \n\nSafety Tier 1 Contractor EEI SIF Rate 2,4 \n\n0.06\n\nSafety Tier 1 Contractor DART Rate 3,4 \n\n0.25\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1 \n\nExcludes employees of Alfa Energy Ltd., an entity acquired by Edison Energy in October 2022. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 \n\nEEI SIF Rate is calculated by multiplying the total number of 2022 EEI SIF incidents (classified by SCE on or before January 13, 2023) by 200,000 and then dividing by the total number of reported hours worked. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 \n\nDART Rate is calculated by multiplying the number of 2022 DARTs (reported to SCE on or before January 10, 2023 for Safety Tier 1 Contractors and classified as a DART by SCE on or before January 13, 2023 for employees) by 200,000 and then dividing by the total number of reported hours worked. The 2022 DART Rates will change based on information received by SCE after January 10, 2023 for Safety Tier 1 Contractors and after January 13, 2023 for employees. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START 4 \n\nExcludes contractors managed by the DGC engaged by SCE to undertake a significant scope of decommissioning activities at San Onofre . \n\n##TABLE_END Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nEdison International is committed to developing a team that reflects the broad diversity of the customers and communities it serves. At Edison International, on average, employees in the same role receive equal pay for equal work. Similar to broader society, when looking at gender or race/ethnicity-specific groups across Edison International without regard to role, female employees and Black and Hispanic employees do not receive comparable pay to male and White employees, respectively, due to lower representation of female, Black and Hispanic employees in higher paying jobs. Edison International is committed to working towards increasing diversity in its higher paying jobs. \n\nThe table below provides Edison International&#39;s employee diversity data 1 as of December 31, 2022:\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\nEmployees 2 \n\n&#8203; \n\nLeaders 3 \n\n&#8203; \n\nExecutives 4 \n\n&#8203; \n\nFemales\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\nRacially/ethnically diverse\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\nRacially/ethnically or gender diverse\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1 \n\nCalculated using the guidelines SCE uses to calculate the diversity data it reports to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Excludes employees of Alfa Energy Ltd., an entity acquired by Edison Energy in October 2022. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2 \n\nExcludes interns and employees on a leave of absence. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3 \n\n&#34;Leaders&#34; represents all non-executive manager and supervisor level employees. \n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4 \n\n&#34;Executives&#34; represents all officers and all director level employees. \n\n##TABLE_END To support Edison International&#39;s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Executives and Leaders are offered training and tools to promote diverse representation throughout their teams. In addition, Edison International evaluates whether hiring processes include diverse candidates and diverse sets of decision makers. In addition to measuring diversity, Edison International also uses various other measures to assess success of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, including without limitation, monitoring hiring, promotion and turnover rates for diverse employees.\n\nWorkforce Continuity \n\nEdison International is committed to identifying and developing the talents of its workforce and takes a variety of steps to increase employee engagement and provide employees opportunities for growth. Employees are provided with training opportunities, including an onboarding program, technical training, required ethics and compliance training and optional trainings to support career development. SCE estimates that over 95% of active SCE employees completed all assigned training required to be completed in 2022 as part of SCE&#39;s enterprise-wide training program. Employees may also be required to take additional trainings based on their job function.\n\nEmployees receive competitive compensation packages which include a wide selection of health plans, a 401(k) savings plan with a company match, wellness programs and initiatives, tuition reimbursement, competitive vacation/holiday program, professional development, volunteer programs, employee assistance program, and a philanthropy and matching contribution program.\n\nEdison International uses various measures to assess employee engagement and satisfaction, including, without limitation, conducting regular employee engagement surveys and monitoring turnover. Edison International Parent and SCE&#39;s combined Turnover Rate was 7.6% and 7.5% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nExecutives engage in succession planning for leadership positions within the organization. Edison International&#39;s and SCE&#39;s Boards of Directors also engage in succession planning and talent development discussions for senior officers.\n\nEdison International&#39;s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report and Sustainability Report are available at http://www.edison.com/sustainability. The reports and any other information contained on, or connected to, this website are not deemed part of, and are not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K . \n\nInsurance\n\nEdison International maintains a property and casualty insurance program for itself and its subsidiaries and excess liability insurance covering liabilities to third parties for bodily injury or property damage resulting from operations. These policies are subject to specific retentions, sub-limits and deductibles, which are comparable to those carried by other utility companies of similar size. Catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and storms, that do not impact Edison directly have had an impact, and can have future impacts, on insurance markets overall.\n\nWhile SCE maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damage experienced.\n\nSCE also has separate insurance programs for nuclear property and liability, workers compensation and wildfires. For further information on nuclear and wildfire insurance, see &#34;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Contingencies.&#34;\n\nSCE\n\nRegulation\n\nCPUC \n\nThe CPUC has the authority to regulate, among other things, retail rates, utility distribution-level equipment and assets, energy purchases on behalf of retail customers, SCE capital structure, rate of return, issuance of securities, disposition of utility assets and facilities, oversight of nuclear decommissioning funding and costs, and aspects of the transmission system planning, site identification and construction, including safety and environmental mitigation. The CPUC can assess penalties on any public utility that violates or fails to comply with its rules and requirements, of up to $100,000, for each offense, which could be assessed daily for a continuing violation. In November 2020, the CPUC adopted a new Enforcement Policy authorizing the staff of the CPUC to draft proposed Administrative Consent Orders and Administrative Enforcement Orders, both of which can include fines and serve as alternatives to issuance of a citation or formal investigation proceeding, for CPUC consideration and approval. \n\nFERC \n\nThe FERC has the authority to regulate wholesale rates as well as other matters, including unbundled transmission service pricing, rate of return, accounting practices, and licensing of hydroelectric projects. The FERC also has jurisdiction over a portion of the retail rates and associated rate design.\n\nCAISO \n\nThe CAISO operates a wholesale energy market primarily in California through which competing electricity generators offer their electricity output to market participants, including electricity retailers. SCE has placed its transmission system under the operational control of the CAISO. \n\nMajor transmission projects required for reliability, economic and other policy reasons are identified and approved through the CAISO&#39;s annual transmission planning process. Depending on the nature of the project identified, it may be assigned to SCE or set for competitive bid. \n\nThe CAISO is conducting transmission planning studies to identify transmission needed to meet a 46 million metric ton GHG emissions target by 2030 set by the CPUC for California&#39;s electricity sector to support California&#39;s target of reducing overall GHG emissions statewide by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. \n\nNERC \n\nThe FERC assigned administrative responsibility to the NERC to establish and enforce reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards, which protect the bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cyber security assets, including supervisory control and data acquisition systems for the electric grid. The reliability standards define the requirements for planning and operating the bulk power system. Compliance with these standards is mandatory. As of the date of this filing, the maximum penalty that may be levied for violating a NERC reliability or critical infrastructure protection standard is approximately $1.5 million per violation, per day.\n\nSCE has formal cyber security and physical security programs that cover SCE&#39;s information technology and operational technology systems, including customer data. Program staff is engaged with industry groups as well as public-private initiatives to reduce risk and to strengthen the security and reliability of SCE&#39;s systems and infrastructure.\n\nOEIS \n\nEffective July 1, 2021, the OEIS became the successor to the CPUC&#39;s Wildfire Safety Division (&#34;WSD&#34;), and was vested with the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the WSD, as well as other statutory authority. OEIS is responsible for, among other things, approving and overseeing compliance with WMPs. As part of overseeing WMP compliance, OEIS can issue notices of violation and recommend that the Commission pursue an enforcement action against an electrical corporation for noncompliance with its approved WMP. Other OEIS tasks include conducting safety culture assessments, approving executive compensation structures, and issuing safety certifications.\n\nNuclear Power Plant Regulation\n\nThe NRC has jurisdiction with respect to the safety of San Onofre and Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants through licensing, oversight and inspection, performance assessment, and enforcement of its requirements. In June 2013, SCE decided to permanently retire and decommission San Onofre. The NRC regulates the decommissioning of San Onofre. For further information, see &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Decommissioning of San Onofre&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nOther Regulatory Agencies\n\nThe construction, planning and project site identification of SCE&#39;s transmission lines and substation facilities require the compliance with various laws and approval of many governmental agencies in addition to the CPUC and FERC. These include various state regulatory agencies depending on the project location; the CAISO; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other environmental, land management and resource agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the California Coastal Commission; and the State Water Resources Control Board. In addition, to the extent that SCE transmission line projects pass through lands owned or controlled by Native American tribes, consent and approval from the affected tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are also necessary for the project to proceed.\n\nCompliance with Government Regulations \n\nSCE incurs significant costs to comply with government regulations. These costs, which include operation and maintenance expenses and capital expenses, including without limitation: costs incurred to maintain wildfire insurance coverage required under AB 1054; comply with environmental regulations, including licensing requirements, regulations governing California&#39;s renewable energy standards and regulations governing the decommissioning of SONGS; land use and construction regulations; privacy and cybersecurity regulations; and Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. SCE also incurs operation and maintenance expenses and capital expenses to comply with requirements set forth in various regulatory decisions, including, costs incurred to implement its approved capital projects and safety programs such as its WMPs.\n\nMost costs incurred by SCE to comply with government regulations are authorized in its CPUC and FERC general rate cases and, are therefore, recovered through electric rates. To the extent SCE incurs costs to comply with government regulations above those that are authorized, or prior to obtaining authorization, for recovery through rates (for instance certain costs incurred in line with SCE&#39;s obligations under its WMPs and tracked in wildfire mitigation-related memorandum accounts), SCE will seek recovery of such costs through electric rates. There is no assurance that SCE will be allowed to fully recover these costs. For further information on wildfire mitigation and wildfire insurance costs, see &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Regulatory Proceedings&#8212;Wildfire Related Regulatory Proceedings.&#34;\n\nSCE earns a rate of return on its authorized capital expenditures included in its rate base. Approximately $1.6 billion of spending by SCE on wildfire risk mitigation capital expenditures made after August 1, 2019 are not included in rate base under the terms of AB 1054.\n\nOverview of Ratemaking Process\n\nCPUC \n\nRevenue authorized by the CPUC through GRC proceedings is intended to provide SCE a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investments in generation and distribution assets and general plant (also referred to as &#34;rate base&#34;) on a forecast basis. Revenue is authorized through quadrennial GRC proceedings where the CPUC sets an annual revenue requirement for the base year which is made up of the operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the authorized cost of capital (discussed below). In the GRC proceedings, the CPUC also generally approves the level of capital spending on a forecast basis. Following the base year, the revenue requirements for the remaining three years will be set by a methodology established in the GRC proceeding, which has generally, among other items, included annual allowances for escalation in operation and maintenance costs and additional changes in capital-related investments. \n\nSCE&#39;s 2021 GRC has authorized revenue requirements for 2021, 2022 and 2023 of $6.9 billion, $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion. In 2022, SCE made additional filings in the 2021 GRC proceeding seeking a revenue requirement of $8.6 billion for 2024. For further discussion of the 2021 GRC, see &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212; SCE&#8212;Regulatory Proceedings&#8212; 2021 General Rate Case Track 4&#34; in the MD&#38;A. SCE expects to file its 2025 GRC application with the CPUC in May 2023, for the four-year period of 2025 &#8211; 2028.\n\nBy May 15 in the year preceding each GRC application filing date, SCE is required to file a Risk Assessment and Mitigation Phase (&#34;RAMP&#34;) application with the CPUC to provide information about SCE&#39;s assessment of its key safety risks and its proposed programs and spending for mitigating those risks. SCE filed its RAMP application for the 2025 GRC in May 2022.The information developed during the RAMP informs SCE&#39;s proposed projects and funding requests in the subsequent phase of the GRC.\n\nThe CPUC regulates SCE&#39;s cost of capital, including its capital structure and authorized rates of return. SCE&#39;s currently authorized capital structure is 43% long-term debt, 5% preferred equity and 52% common equity. SCE&#39;s currently \n\nauthorized cost of capital for 2023, 2024 and 2025 consists of: cost of long-term debt of 4.39%, cost of preferred equity of 6.50% and ROE of 10.05% and includes an adjustment mechanism set by the CPUC that could adjust authorized cost of capital between SCE&#39;s cost of capital proceedings. Based on the capital structure and cost factors discussed above, SCE&#39;s weighted average return on rate base will be 7.44% for 2023. The CPUC also continued the cost of capital adjustment mechanism for 2023, 2024, and 2025, but opened a second phase in the proceeding to consider proposed changes to the mechanism. The benchmark value for the mechanism for SCE beginning in 2023 is the 12-month, October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, average Moody&#8217;s Baa utility bond yield of 4.37%. Under the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, if the difference between the benchmark and the average of the same index for the 12-month period to September 30, 2023 exceeds 100-basis points, SCE&#39;s CPUC-authorized ROE would be adjusted by half the amount of the difference (up or down) and SCE&#39;s costs of long-term debt and preferred equity would also be adjusted to reflect the then current embedded costs and projected interest rates effective January 1, 2024. For further information see &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Cost of Capital Applications.&#34; \n\nCPUC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity sales so that SCE receives revenue equal to amounts authorized. Differences between amounts collected and authorized levels are either collected from or refunded to customers, and, therefore, such differences do not impact operating revenue. Accordingly, SCE is neither benefited nor burdened by the volume of retail electricity sales.\n\nCost-recovery balancing accounts track the difference between actual expenditures associated with the account, revenue authorized for recovery by the CPUC (authorized revenue requirement), and the actual revenues collected within customer rates to cover those specific expenditures. These balancing accounts are used to track and recover, among other things, SCE&#39;s decoupled costs of fuel and purchased power, as well as certain operation and maintenance expenses. SCE earns no return on these activities and although differences between forecasted and actual costs do not impact earnings, such differences do impact cash flows and can change rapidly. SCE also has capital-related balancing accounts on which it earns a return, such as the pole loading balancing account. Costs tracked in balancing accounts are not subject to after-the-fact reasonableness review unless the balancing accounts are one-way balancing accounts or otherwise subject to a cost cap. SCE uses balancing accounts for cost recovery of authorized wildfire insurance expenses, WCCP expenditures up to 110% of authorized WCCP amounts and up to 115% of authorized vegetation management expenses. SCE also has memorandum accounts, which track costs above authorized levels eligible for cost recovery upon a future reasonableness review. Under the 2021 GRC final decision SCE can seek recovery of wildfire insurance expenses above authorized levels, WCCP amounts above 110% of authorized levels and vegetation management expenses above 115% of authorized levels through reasonableness review applications. These incremental amounts are tracked in memorandum accounts.\n\nSCE&#39;s cost-recovery mechanism for its fuel and purchased power-related costs is facilitated in three main balancing accounts, the ERRA, the PABA, and the NSGBA. For all three accounts, SCE sets rates based on an annual forecast of the costs that it expects to incur during the subsequent year. In addition, the CPUC has established a &#34;trigger&#34; mechanism for the ERRA and the PABA. The trigger mechanism requires SCE to request an expeditious rate change if the sum of the ERRA balance and the bundled service customers&#39; pro-rata share of the PABA balance exceeds 4% of SCE&#39;s prior year generation rate revenue and SCE does not expect the aggregate overcollection or undercollection to fall below 5% of SCE&#39;s prior year generation rate revenue within 120 days. For 2023, SCE estimates the 4% and 5% trigger amounts to be approximately $216 million and $270 million, respectively. \n\nFor 2022, the 4% and 5% trigger amounts were approximately $200 million and $250 million, respectively. See &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Regulatory Proceedings&#8212;ERRA Proceeding&#34; for information regarding SCE filing an application to advice the CPUC that SCE&#8217;s undercollections had exceeded the trigger amount as of September 30, 2022. \n\nThe majority of fuel and purchased power procurement-related costs eligible for recovery through cost-recovery rates are pre-approved by the CPUC through specific decisions and a procurement plan with predefined standards that establish the eligibility for cost-recovery. If such costs are subsequently found to be non-compliant with this procurement plan, then this could negatively impact SCE&#39;s earnings and cash flows. In addition, the CPUC retrospectively reviews outages associated with utility-owned generation and SCE&#39;s power procurement contract administration activities through the annual ERRA review proceeding. A CPUC finding that SCE was unreasonable or imprudent with respect to its utility-owned generation outages and contract administration activities, could negatively impact SCE&#39;s earnings and cash flows. The ERRA review proceeding is also used as a venue to review costs in various memorandum and balancing accounts including the Pole Loading and Deteriorated Pole Programs Balancing Account.\n\nA California law adopted in 2022 has directed the CPUC to develop a definition of energy affordability and to use energy affordability metrics to guide the development of any protections, incentives, discounts, or new programs to assist residential customers facing hardships or disconnections due to electricity or gas bills and to assess the impact of proposed rate increases on different types of residential customers.\n\nFERC \n\nTransmission capital and operating costs that are prudently incurred, including a return on its net investment in transmission assets, are recovered through revenue authorized by the FERC. Since 2012, SCE has used a formula rate to determine SCE&#39;s FERC transmission revenue requirement, including its construction work in progress (CWIP) revenue requirement. Under operation of the formula rate, transmission revenue will be updated to actual cost of service annually. The transmission revenue requirement and rates are updated each December, to reflect a forecast of costs for the upcoming rate period, as well as a true up of the transmission revenue to actual costs incurred by SCE in the prior calendar year on its formula rate.\n\nThe FERC ROE is currently 10.3%. For further information on the FERC formula rates, related transmission revenue requirements and rate changes, see &#34;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;SCE&#8212;Regulatory Proceedings&#8212;2023 FERC Formula Rate Annual Update&#34; in the MD&#38;A.\n\nRetail Rates Structure and Residential Rate Design\n\nTo develop retail rates, the authorized revenue requirements are allocated among all customer classes (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and street lighting) on a functional basis (i.e., generation, distribution, transmission, etc.). Specific rate components are designed to recover the authorized revenue allocated to each customer class. \n\nSCE has a two-tier residential rate structure. The first tier is priced at below-average cost and is intended to cover the customer&#39;s essential electricity needs. The second tier is priced at 25% more than the first tier. The CPUC has ordered a transition from tiered to t ime-of-use ( &#34; TOU &#34; ) rates for most residential customers unless they opt to stay on the tiered rate structure. Under a TOU rate structure, rates are based on the time of day and the season. TOU rates are typically lower early in the day, overnight, and on the weekends when energy resources are less in demand. SCE completed a multi-year transition of most customers to TOU rates in June 2022, and, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 60 percent of residential customers are on TOU rates. To recover a portion of the fixed costs of serving no- or low-usage residential customers, SCE assesses both fixed charges of less than $1 per month, and a minimum charge of $10 per month ($5 for low-income customers). There is currently an open proceeding pending at the CPUC where the CPUC is considering establishing an income-graduated fixed charge for residential rates for customers of all investor-owned \n\nelectric utilities. For information on residential rates for customers with renewable generation systems, see &#34;&#8212;Competition&#34; below. \n\nPurchased Power and Fuel Supply\n\nSCE obtains the power, energy, and local grid support needed to serve its customers primarily from purchases from external parties. SCE estimates that approximately 20% of power delivered to SCE&#39;s customers in 2022 came from SCE&#39;s own generating facilities.\n\nNatural Gas Supply\n\nSCE requires natural gas to meet contractual obligations for power tolling agreements (power contracts in which SCE has agreed to provide or pay for the natural gas used to generate electricity) and to fuel its Mountainview and peaker plants, which are generation units that operate in response to wholesale market signals related to power prices and reliability needs. The physical natural gas purchased by SCE is sourced in competitive interstate markets at trading points on the SoCalGas local distribution company system and the El Paso pipeline. SoCalGas is the primary provider of intrastate pipeline transportation service to the gas-fueled generation stations that SCE controls. In 2015 &#8211; 2016, SoCalGas experienced a significant natural gas fuel leak at its Aliso Canyon underground gas storage facility. As a result, there continue to be limitations on the use and capability of the facility, and the current available inventory at the Aliso Canyon facility is limited to 60% of maximum capacity. To date, SCE has found that gas storage-use restrictions combined with SoCalGas pipeline maintenance constraints contributed to increased electricity costs for customers but did not impact grid reliability. However, there is no certainty that these restrictions or pipeline constraints will not impact grid reliability in the future. Price increases faced by customers would not affect SCE&#39;s earnings because SCE expects recovery of these costs through the ERRA balancing account or other CPUC approved procurement plans. However, these higher prices may impact cash flow due to the timing of those recoveries. For more information on cost-recovery mechanisms, see &#34;&#8212;Overview of Ratemaking Process&#34; above. SCE is actively monitoring legislative and regulatory processes that are addressing pipeline and electric grid operations impacted by the Aliso Canyon leak, including an Order Instituting Investigation issued by the CPUC in February 2017 to consider the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon facility. SCE has also made additional procurement efforts to alleviate the impact of the partial closure of Aliso Canyon, including accelerating existing contracts for new capacity, procuring energy storage from third-parties, contracting for design, build, and transfer of utility-owned storage, procuring additional demand response and contracting for firm gas transportation capacity.\n\nCAISO Wholesale Energy Market\n\nThe CAISO operates a wholesale energy market primarily in California through which competing electricity generators offer their electricity output to market participants, including electricity retailers. The CAISO schedules power in hourly increments with hourly prices through a day-ahead market in California and schedules power in fifteen-minute and five-minute increments with fifteen-minute and five-minute prices through two real-time markets that cover California and portions of six neighboring states through the Energy Imbalance Market. Both markets optimize energy procurement, ancillary service procurement, unit commitment and congestion management. SCE participates in the day-ahead and real-time markets for the sale of its own generation and generation under contract purchases for its load requirements. In February 2023 the CAISO Board and the Western Energy Imbalance Market (&#34;Western EIM&#34;) Governing Body approved a proposal for an Extended Day-Ahead Market (&#34;EDAM&#34;) which, if approved by the FERC, will give utilities in the Western EIM the option of joining a centralized day-ahead market run by the CAISO. The EDAM, if adopted, will give utilities an opportunity to lock in energy prices a day in advance, and thereby substantially avoid volatility in the real-time energy market.\n\nThe CPUC&#39;s Resource Adequacy program imposes resource adequacy requirements on load-serving entities like SCE that are designed to provide sufficient resources to the CAISO to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the grid in real time. The CPUC has adopted a central procurement structure in SCE&#39;s distribution service area for local resource adequacy that transfers the responsibility for procuring local resource adequacy from other local load-serving entities to SCE, as a central procurement entity (&#34;CPE&#34;) for its distribution service area, starting with the 2023 resource adequacy compliance year. Under this structure, while SCE will procure local resource adequacy to meet the local resource adequacy requirement for its distribution service area, other load-serving entities can also procure their own local resources. Load-serving entities that procure their own local resources can: (i) sell the capacity to SCE, (ii) utilize the resources, or (iii) voluntarily show the resources to meet their own needs, thereby reducing the amount of local resource adequacy the CPE will need to procure and reducing the total CPE procurement costs shared by all load-serving entities in that distribution service area. In June 2022, the CPUC reformed the resource adequacy framework by adopting SCE&#39;s proposed &#34;24-hour slice of day&#34; structure, which addresses the large variations in renewable generation that result in costly over procurement if utilities assess resource need based on periods longer than one hour.\n\nFollowing state-wide rotating outages in August 2020 that impacted a significant number of SCE&#39;s customers, the CPUC has taken action towards ensuring reliable electric service in the event that an extreme heat events occur during summer. In June 2021, the CPUC issued a decision requiring at least an aggregate of 11,500 MW of additional net qualifying renewable or zero-emitting capacity to be procured collectively by all of the load-serving entities subject to CAISO. The aggregate additional capacity is required by 2026, with 2,000 MW required by 2023, an additional 6,000 MW required by 2024, an additional 1,500 MW required by 2025, and an additional 2,000 MW required by 2026. SCE&#39;s allocation of the requirements is 705 MW by 2023, 2,114 MW by 2024, 529 MW by 2025 and 705 MW by 2026, for a total of 4,052 MW. In January 2023, the CPUC issued a Proposed Decision which, if adopted, would require all of the load-serving entities subject to CAISO to collectively procure an additional 4,000 MW of net qualifying renewable or zero-emitting capacity by 2028. SCE&#39;s allocation of the addition 4,000 MW is 1,410 MW. SCE continues to actively pursue and execute various actions to procure addition capacity. For instance, in January 2023, the CPUC approved SCE entering into four lithium-ion battery storage contracts with a total capacity of approximately 619 MW, which are expected to provide approximately 562 MW of capacity towards SCE&#8217;s allocation of the 11,500 MW requirement. The contracts range from 10-15 years and the projects are expected to be in service in 2023 and 2024. \n\nIn July 2021, California&#39;s Governor issued an Emergency Proclamation related to accelerating construction of new resources ahead of possible summer 2022 shortfalls. Subsequently, the CPUC opened a Phase 2 of its emergency reliability rulemaking proceeding to ensure there is adequate supply and demand management to achieve electrical system reliability in 2022 and 2023. In October 2021, SCE contracted for the construction of utility owned storage at three sites in SCE&#39;s service territory with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 MW, which SCE has been advised will be in-service prior to June 2023. See &#34;Management Overview&#8212;Capital Program&#8212;Utility Owned Storage Projects&#34; in the MD&#38;A. In December 2021, the CPUC issued a final decision in Phase 2 of its emergency reliability rulemaking proceeding adopting several supply- and demand-side measures to help provide contingency resources with the goal of ensuring that there is adequate electric power in the event of an extreme weather event in the summers of 2022 or 2023, including directing the investor-owned utilities to continue their procurement efforts and endeavor to achieve an effective 20 to 22.5% planning reserve margin for the summers of 2022 and 2023.\n\nCompetition\n\nSCE faces retail competition in the sale of electricity to the extent that federal and California laws permit other sources to provide electricity and related services to retail customers within SCE&#39;s service area. While retail competition impacts customer rates it does not impact SCE&#39;s earnings activities because the volume of electricity sales is decoupled from authorized revenue. The increased retail competition is from governmental entities formed by cities, counties, and \n\ncertain other public agencies to generate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses, known as CCAs. While California law provides only limited opportunities for customers in SCE&#39;s service area to choose to purchase power directly from an Electric Service Provider, a limited, phased-in expansion of customer choice (&#34;Direct Access&#34;) for nonresidential customers was authorized beginning in 2009, and an additional limited expansion of Direct Access was authorized in 2018. When a customer who had previously taken bundled service from SCE converts to taking retail electricity service from an Electric Service Provider or a CCA, SCE remains that customer&#39;s transmission and distribution provider. Other forms of departing load include customer generation, and load that departs SCE service entirely to take electricity service from a publicly owned utility or a tribal utility.\n\nCalifornia law requires bundled service customers remain financially indifferent to departing load customers and to the mass return of departing load customers in the event of an Electric Service Provider or CCA&#39;s failure or other service termination. The CPUC has issued a series of decisions designed to avoid cost shifting in the context of departing load, including revising the PCIA methodology to effectively address the cost shifts to bundled service customers.\n\nInvestor-owned utilities serve as the default providers of last resort in their respective service areas and can be significantly impacted by the Electric Service Providers or CCAs failing or otherwise exiting the market. In March 2021, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to examine the risks of catastrophic failures by Electric Service Providers or CCAs on investor-owned utilities and the need for any changes in the regulatory framework to increase consumer protections and financial security requirements, among other measures.\n\nAs of year-end 2022, SCE had twelve CCAs serving customers in its service territory that represented approximately 27% of SCE&#39;s total service load. While one CCA deregistered and exited, two new CCAs implemented and two CCAs expanded in SCE&#39;s service territory in 2022. Two expanded CCAs have been approved by the CPUC to serve customers in SCE&#39;s service territory in 2023, however one of the implementations is likely to be deregistered. Based on recent load statistics, SCE anticipates that Direct Access and CCA load will be approximately 44% of its total service load by the end of 2023. \n\nCustomer-owned power generation and storage alternatives, such as rooftop solar facilities and battery systems, are increasingly used by SCE&#39;s customers as a result of technological developments, federal and state subsidies, and declining costs of such alternatives. Beginning in 2020, and subject to certain exceptions, all newly built homes in California are required to have solar installations.\n\nCalifornia legislation passed in 1995 encouraged private residential and commercial investment in renewable energy resources by requiring SCE and other investor-owned utilities to offer a NEM billing option to customers who install eligible power generation systems to supply all or part of their energy needs. NEM customers are interconnected to SCE&#39;s grid and credited for the net difference between the electricity SCE supplied to them through the grid and the electricity the customer exported to SCE over a 12-month period. SCE is required to credit the NEM customer for most of the power they sell back to SCE at the retail rate. Through the credit they receive, NEM customers effectively avoid paying certain grid-related costs. NEM customers are also exempted from some non-bypassable, standby and departing load charges and interconnection fees. Electric Service Providers and CCAs are not required by law to offer NEM rates.\n\nIn January 2016, the CPUC issued a decision adopting a new standard NEM tariff for customers with renewable generation systems. The changes that the CPUC decision made to the existing NEM tariff did not significantly impact the NEM subsidy. Specifically, the decision required customers that take service on SCE&#39;s NEM tariff after June 2017 to continue to be compensated at the retail rate, minus certain non-bypassable charges. NEM customers also continued to be exempted from standby and departing load charges but were required to pay a $75 interconnection fee and to select a time-of-use retail rate.\n\nThe effect of these types of competition on SCE generally is to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from SCE by retail customers. Customers who use alternative electricity sources typically continue to utilize and pay for SCE&#39;s transmission and distribution services, however, current NEM customers utilize, but do not pay the full cost for, those services. While changes in volume or rates generally do not impact SCE&#39;s earnings activities, decreased retail electricity sales by SCE has the effect of increasing utility rates because the costs of the distribution grid are not currently borne by all customers that benefit from its use. See &#34;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Southern California Edison Company&#8212;Competitive and Market Risks.&#34; \n\nIn August 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to develop a successor to the NEM tariffs. In December 2022, the CPUC issued final decision reducing the current NEM subsidy by decoupling export compensation from the retail rate. Under the final decision, the CPUC deferred consideration of whether to assess a grid participation charge to address the costs participating customers avoid by reducing the electricity they purchase from SCE and whether to adopt other mechanisms that would allow SCE to recover its cost of service and the costs of many public policy programs to another pending proceeding. The final decision also provides an enhanced subsidy for lower income customers and customers who pair rooftop solar with energy storage systems. The final decision does not apply to existing NEM customers until after they have completed twenty years on their existing NEM tariff, at which time they will move to the new, reduced tariff.\n\nIn the area of transmission infrastructure, SCE has experienced increased competition from independent transmission providers under the FERC&#39;s transmission planning requirements rules, effective in 2011, that removed the incumbent public utility transmission owners&#39; federally-based right of first refusal to construct certain new transmission facilities and mandated regional and interregional transmission planning. Regional entities, such as independent system operators, have processes for regional and interregional transmission planning and the competitive solicitation and selection of developers (including incumbent utilities) to build and own certain types of new transmission projects. The CAISO has held competitive solicitations pursuant to these rules and independent service providers were selected.\n\n"

Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying condensed financial statements of Edison International Parent should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Edison International and subsidiaries (&#34;Registrant&#34;) included in this Form 10-K. Edison International Parent&#39;s significant accounting policies are consistent with those of the Registrant, SCE and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.\n\nDividends Received\n\nEdison International Parent received cash dividends from SCE of $ 1.3 billion, $ 975 million and $ 1.3 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nDividend Restrictions\n\nCPUC holding company rules require that SCE&#39;s dividend policy be established by SCE&#39;s Board of Directors on the same basis as if SCE were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of SCE, as deemed to be necessary to meet SCE&#39;s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both Edison International and SCE. In addition, the CPUC regulates SCE&#39;s capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders.\n\nThe common equity component of SCE&#39;s CPUC authorized capital structure is 52 % on a weighted average basis over the January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025 compliance period. This is unchanged from the January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 compliance period. The CPUC authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on GAAP due to certain exclusions allowed by CPUC, including the impact of SCE&#39;s contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund under AB 1054. For further information, see &#34;Business&#8212;SCE&#8212;Overview of Ratemaking Process&#34; and &#34;Business&#8212;Southern California Wildfires.&#34; \n\nIn May 2020, the CPUC issued a decision on SCE&#39;s application to the CPUC for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows SCE to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 Wildfire/Mudslide Events. With these exclusions, SCE was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. The temporary exclusion lapsed on May 7, 2022. In April 2022, SCE filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. Under the CPUC&#39;s rules, SCE will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. While the exclusion is in place, SCE is required to notify the CPUC if an adverse financial event reduces SCE&#39;s spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the CPUC in the proceeding. The last spot equity ratio SCE filed with the CPUC in the proceeding did not exclude the then $ 1.8 billion net charge and was 45.2 % as of December 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of SCE&#39;s CPUC authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above 48 % on a weighted average basis over the applicable 37-month period). SCE&#39;s spot equity ratio on December 31, 2018 would have been 48.7 % had the $ 1.8 billion net charge at December 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore SCE will notify the CPUC if its spot ratio drops below 47.7 % in any quarter.
