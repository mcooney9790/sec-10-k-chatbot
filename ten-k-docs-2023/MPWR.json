(&#8220;MPS&#8221;) is a fabless company with a global footprint that provides high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic solutions. Incorporated in 1997, our three core strengths include deep system-level knowledge, strong semiconductor expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the areas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages enable us to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions found in storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to reduce energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life. We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur principal executive office is located in Kirkland, Washington. We have over 3,200 employees worldwide, with locations in Asia (primarily in China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan), Europe (primarily in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and the United States.\n\n&#160;\n\nIndustry Overview \n\n&#160;\n\nSemiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment. Within the semiconductor industry, components can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors or integrated circuits (&#8220;ICs&#8221;), in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs can be further divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal. Digital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes. Analog ICs, in contrast, handle real world signals such as temperature, pressure, light, sound, or speed. In addition, analog ICs also perform power management functions, such as regulating or converting voltages, for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems.\n\n&#160;\n\nAnalog and Mixed-Signal Markets. We focus on the market for high performance analog and mixed-signal ICs. High performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors, which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip, greater precision, better power efficiency and density, higher speed and lower heat and noise. There are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixed-signal IC markets from digital IC markets. These factors include longer product life cycles, numerous market segments, technology that is difficult to replicate, relative complexity of design and process technologies, importance of experienced design engineers, lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets. We have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above-average growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.\n\n&#160;\n\nEnd Markets and Applications \n\n&#160;\n\nWe design and develop our products for the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets, with the storage and computing market representing the largest portion of our revenue in 2022. The following table is a summary of the various end market applications for our products, and those markets&#8217; contribution as a percentage of our total revenue:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Percentage of Total Revenue \n\n&#160; End Markets \n\n&#160; Applications \n\n&#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; Storage and computing\n\n&#160; Storage applications, enterprise notebooks, computers and printers\n\n&#160; &#160; 25.3 % &#160; &#160; 21.2 % &#160; &#160; 21.4 % Enterprise Data\n\n&#160; Data center and workstation computing\n\n&#160; &#160; 14.0 % &#160; &#160; 9.6 % &#160; &#160; 8.6 % Automotive\n\n&#160; Infotainment, digital cockpits and connectivity applications\n\n&#160; &#160; 16.7 % &#160; &#160; 16.9 % &#160; &#160; 12.9 % Industrial\n\n&#160; Power sources, smart meters, security applications and industrial automation\n\n&#160; &#160; 12.2 % &#160; &#160; 15.3 % &#160; &#160; 14.2 % Communications\n\n&#160; 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications\n\n&#160; &#160; 14.0 % &#160; &#160; 13.6 % &#160; &#160; 16.8 % Consumer\n\n&#160; Home appliances, gaming consoles, smart TVs, mobile devices, lighting, monitors, stereos, set-top boxes and chargers\n\n&#160; &#160; 17.8 % &#160; &#160; 23.4 % &#160; &#160; 26.1 % ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProduct Families \n\n&#160;\n\nOur proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller, single-chip power management ICs. These technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. Our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy, power efficiency, quality and longevity, making them cost-effective and more sustainable relative to many competing solutions. Our key product families include the following:\n\n&#160;\n\nDirect Current ( &#8220; DC &#8221; ) to DC Products. DC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems, such as portable electronic devices, wireless LAN access points, computers and notebooks, monitors, infotainment applications and medical equipment. We believe that our DC to DC products are differentiated in the market, particularly with respect to their high degree of integration, high voltage operation, high load current, high switching speed, small footprint, and high energy efficiency. These features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components that need to be produced and consumed, a smaller form factor, more accurate regulation of voltages, lower power consumption and, ultimately, lower system cost, increased reliability and lower carbon emissions through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices. The DC to DC product family accounted for 95% of our total revenue in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n&#160;\n\nLighting Control Products. Lighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products. Lighting control ICs for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for LCD panels typically found in computers and notebooks, monitors, car navigation systems and televisions. Backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The Lighting Control product family accounted for 5% of our total revenue in each of 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn the future, we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate while fulfilling our customers&#8217; evolving needs, enter new market segments, gain market share, grow in regions outside of China, Taiwan and other Asian markets, expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\n\n&#160;\n\nCustomers, Sales and Marketing \n\n&#160;\n\nWe sell our products through third-party distributors, value-added resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), original design manufacturers (&#8220;ODMs&#8221;), electronic manufacturing service (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) providers and other end customers. Our third-party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us, which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers, including OEMs, ODMs or EMS providers. Our value-added resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of OEMs, and EMS providers typically provide manufacturing services for OEMs and other electronic product suppliers. \n\n&#160;\n\nSales to our largest distributor accounted for 24% of our total revenue in 2022, 26% in 2021, and 24% in 2020. In addition to our largest distributor, one distributor accounted for 19% of our total revenue in 2022, two distributors accounted for 15% and 10% of our total revenue in 2021, and one distributor accounted for 11% of our total revenue in 2020. No other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10% of our full-year, total revenue in any of the periods presented.\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the non-exclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products. These agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90 days from the date of invoice. In addition, we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have sales offices in China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and throughout Europe. Our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application. We maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers&#8217; engineers in the development of their systems&#8217; electronics containing our products.\n\n&#160;\n\nBecause our sales are primarily billed and payable in United States dollars, our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates. However, because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in Asia, changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 86%, 90% and 91%, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement, and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue. \n\n&#160;\n\nTypical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. We often build inventory in advance based on our forecast of future customer orders. This subjects us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast, which could lead to inventories in excess of demand. If excess inventory exists, it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount, take a significant write-down or dispose of it altogether, all of which would negatively affect our profit margins. In addition, in response to market conditions, we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products, which could result in insufficient inventory levels if we underestimate the demand for our products.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nResearch and Development \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have assembled a qualified team of engineers primarily in China, Taiwan, the United States, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, and Hungary, with core competencies in analog and mixed-signal design. Through our research and development efforts, we have developed a collection of intellectual property and know-how that we are able to leverage across our products and markets. These include the development of high efficiency power devices, the design of precision analog circuits and systems, expertise in mixed-signal design, and integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas: systems architecture, circuit design and implementation, and process technologies. In the area of systems architecture, we are exploring new ways of solving our customers&#8217; system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities. In the area of circuit design and implementation, our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products. In the area of process technologies, we are investing in research and development resources to provide leading-edge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits. We believe process technologies are key strategic components to our future growth. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur growth is fueled by our customers&#8217; need for our power efficient solutions. Consequently, we focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products in our research and development efforts in all three targeted areas. Our products are principally positioned as achieving lower power loss and enabling significant reductions in circuit board space and shrinking or eliminating many passive components that are otherwise needed by competitors&#8217; offerings. In addition, the life cycles of our products are typically over 10 years, reducing the manufacturing needs and associated carbon emissions associated with production of replacement products.\n\n&#160;\n\nPatents and Intellectual Property Matters \n\n&#160;\n\nWe rely on our proprietary technologies, which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,557 patents/applications issued or pending, of which 546 patents have been issued in the United States. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through December 2042. Our patents are material to our business, but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success. We also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees&#8217; commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. We also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate. We have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business. Despite precautions that we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the steps we take are adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims. Such litigation can be very costly and may divert our management resources. Further, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products. In the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be enjoined from selling selected products, could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers, or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties. If any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nManufacturing \n\n&#160;\n\nWe utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures. In contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies, which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners, we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf. This close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ICs.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in China, Taiwan and South Korea. Once our silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped to our facilities in Chengdu, China for wafer sort, which is a testing process performed to identify non-functioning dies. Our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in China and Malaysia. The assembled ICs are then sent either for final testing at our Chengdu facilities, or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur manufacturing facilities in Chengdu, China, enable us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs. We have expanded our product testing capabilities in these facilities and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nCompetition \n\n&#160;\n\nThe analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products, and our ability to meet our and customers&#8217; energy efficiency goals. Our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products and, in some cases, have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with several manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. We consider our primary competitors to include Analog Devices, Infineon Technologies, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Power Integrations, Renesas Electronics, ROHM Semiconductor, Semtech and Texas Instruments.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market. We believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell and on the basis of key competitive factors in our industry, particularly because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated with lower energy consumption, possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competitors. However, there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market. In addition, there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful, competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. While we are not immune from industry downturns, we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term.\n\n&#160;\n\nHistorically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this trend.\n\n&#160;\n\nGovernment Regulations \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to international, federal and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment; the treatment, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes; recycling and product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce, and the management of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. In recent years, these controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions have had, and we believe may continue to have, a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components.\n\n&#160;\n\nGovernment regulations can be complex and are subject to change in the future, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures and operating expenses, revenue, resource allocation, competitive position, or financial condition, though the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify. Refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws, international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the U.S. and China.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nHuman Capital \n\n&#160;\n\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixed-signal ICs, our engineers generally have many years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude. Analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key officers, managers, engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 3,247 employees primarily in Asia, Europe, South America and the United States, compared with 2,773 employees as of December 31, 2021.\n\n&#160;\n\nCompetition for talent in the semiconductor industry is strong, and compensation is critical to our recruiting and retention philosophy, especially given our rapid growth and our need to attract talented employees with a broad range of skills. Our total compensation packages are competitive, fair, and structured to encourage employees to invest in our future. Our employee benefits programs include a combination of supplemental benefits including paid time off for holidays and vacations, health insurance and other plan benefits.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer, and we make employment decisions based on merit and business needs. We are committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for all our workers. Our Worker Health and Safety Plan is certified to ISO 45001 standards, the world&#8217;s voluntary, international standard for occupational health and safety. We believe that certifying to these standards enables our company to provide safe and healthy workplaces by preventing work-related injury and health issues.\n\n&#160;\n\nAvailable Information \n\n&#160;\n\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that are filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge.

\n\n&#160;\n\nWe derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia and have significant operations in Asia, which may expose us to political, cultural, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe derive most of our revenue from customers located in Asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and value-added reseller agreements with parties located in Asia. As a result, we are subject to significant risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 86% of our revenue was from customers in Asia. There are risks inherent in doing business in Asia, and internationally in general, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nchanges in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements or restrictions, including tax and trade laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products, and government action to restrict our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products may require export licenses;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ntrade restrictions imposed by the U.S. related to goods imported from regions in China with records of forced labor and other human rights issues;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations impacting intercompany transactions;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies, which could affect the competitiveness of our products;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ntransportation delays and other supply chain issues;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nchanges in tax regulations in China that may impact our tax status in Chengdu, Hangzhou and other regions where we have significant operations;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ntariffs imposed by China and the U.S. that may impact our sales;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nmulti-tiered distribution channels that may diminish visibility to end customer pricing and purchase patterns;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ninternational political relationships and acts or threats of war;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nterrorism and threats of terrorism;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nepidemics and illnesses, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nadverse weather conditions or other natural disasters such as extreme heatwaves, affecting energy supply in our facilities in China and causing work stoppages;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nwork stoppages related to employee dissatisfaction;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\neconomic, social and political instability;\n\n&#160; &#160; &#8226;\n\nlonger accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivables;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nenforcing contracts generally; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nless effective protection of intellectual property and contractual arrangements.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nIf we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers, we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions, in particular changing economic conditions in China. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth, recession, stagflation, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, tighter credit, higher interest rates, higher unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect logistics or demand for our products. For example, in recent months, some of our customers have cancelled, decreased or delayed their existing and future orders with us. Volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability.\n\n&#160;\n\nDemand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the United States, Europe, China and the rest of Asia. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic disruptions, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic downturn or the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or subsequent economic recovery worldwide, in our industry, or in the different markets that we serve. We also may not accurately assess the impact of changing market and economic conditions on our business and operations. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn particular, since we have significant operations in China, our business development plans, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political, social and economic developments in China. A slowdown in economic growth in China could adversely impact our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and partners in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of the operations and financial condition. There is no guarantee that economic downturns, whether actual or perceived, any further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in China will not occur or persist in the future, that they will not be protracted, or that governments will respond adequately to control and reverse such conditions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nChina has continued to experience COVID-19 outbreaks, specifically in Shanghai and Chengdu where we have business operations and where many of our customers and suppliers are located. In response to the outbreaks, local governments have implemented, and may continue to implement, strict measures including quarantines, shutdowns and other business restrictions, which have resulted in logistics challenges throughout China. These strict measures, and the disruptions as a result thereof, did not have a material adverse impact on our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. However, the impact of any new outbreaks on our business and financial results for 2023 will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If governmental restrictions are re-imposed or additional measures are imposed to contain the spread of the virus, we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and reduced capacity available to us at some of our suppliers, all of which could limit our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to monitor the situation, assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and take actions to mitigate adverse consequences to the extent feasible.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in China, which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have manufacturing and testing facilities in China. We face the following risks, among others, with respect to our operations in China:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nchallenges to hire and maintain a qualified workforce;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nnatural disasters such as severe heatwaves or droughts, which could result in prolonged power shortages or water restrictions in our facilities;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nShutdowns or reduced operations due to COVID-19 outbreaks or government restrictions;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nchallenges to maintain appropriate and acceptable manufacturing controls; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nhigher than anticipated overhead and other costs of operation.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nIf we are unable to maintain our facilities in China at fully operational status with qualified workers, appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels, we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels, which would affect our gross margins. In addition, if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe and our manufacturing partners and suppliers are or will be subject to extensive Chinese government regulations, and the benefit of various incentives from Chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners and suppliers receive may be reduced or eliminated, which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in China. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have manufacturing and testing facilities in China and most of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are located in China. The Chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in China. Additionally, the Chinese government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in China. It exercises significant control over China&#8217;s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\n\n&#160;\n\nAny additional new regulations or the amendment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners and suppliers to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in China, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided, and continue to provide, various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in China. Such incentives include cash awards, tax rebates, reduced tax rates, favorable lending policies and other measures, some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners, suppliers and us with respect to our facilities in China. Any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\nUncertainties with respect to China &#8217; s legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in policies, laws and regulations in China could adversely affect our operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nChina&#8217;s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since China&#8217;s legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations and enforcement of these laws and regulations are not always uniform and involve uncertainties. In addition, any new or amended laws and regulations related to, among other things, foreign investment and manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to operate our business in China.\n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since China&#8217;s administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection than those that may be provided in other jurisdictions. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce contracts in China and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurthermore, China&#8217;s legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation may have occurred. Such unpredictability towards our contractual, property and procedural rights and any failure to quickly respond to changes in the regulatory environment in China could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations and proceed with our future business plans in China.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to export laws, trade policies and restrictions including international tariffs that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including, in certain cases, dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially limited our operations or our sales, but could materially limit them in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past, there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, U.S. laws and regulations and sanctions, or threat of sanctions, that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services to our customers may also encourage our customers to develop their own solutions to replace our products, or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. More specifically, there have been several rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that have taken effect in the past few years, some of which prompted retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting both countries&#8217; overall economic condition, as well as our business and financial results. If these tariffs continue or additional new tariffs are imposed in the future, they could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in China and the U.S.\n\n&#160;\n\nAdditionally, the imposition of tariffs is dependent upon the classification of goods under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff System (&#8220;HTS&#8221;) and the country of origin of the goods. Determination of the HTS and the origin of the goods is a technical matter that can be subjective in nature. Accordingly, although we believe our classifications of both HTS and origin are appropriate, there is no certainty that our assessment will be consistent with that of the U.S. government. If the U.S. government does not agree with our determinations, we could be required to pay additional amounts, including potential penalties.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe face political and other risks conducting business in Taiwan and Hong Kong, particularly due to their tense relationships with China. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have significant business operations in Taiwan, and many of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are located in Taiwan. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected by changes in governmental and economic policies in Taiwan, social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Taiwan due to its unique international political status. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established between Taiwan and China, we cannot assure that relations between Taiwan and China will not face political or economic uncertainties in the future. Any deterioration in the relations between Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in Taiwan, could disrupt our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, the Chinese government has promulgated new regulations impacting economic and political stability within Hong Kong where many of our customers are located. Due to the sensitive political climate these regulations created, there are increasing risks that the national security law may trigger sanctions or other forms of restrictions by foreign governments including the U.S., which could affect companies conducting business in Hong Kong. It is difficult for us to predict the impact, if any, the implementation of the national security law will have on our business, as such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\n&#160;\n\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies, including the Renminbi, may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nSeveral of our manufacturing and other suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in China for the foreseeable future. In connection with the global economic downturn, there has been an increased level of global currency fluctuation and volatility. If the value of the Renminbi rises against the U.S. Dollar, there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located outside of China, which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, our sales are primarily denominated in the U.S. Dollar. If the value of the U.S Dollar rises against other currencies, it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including intercompany transactions between the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Product Demand and Sales \n\n&#160;\n\nWe may not experience growth rates comparable to past years. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn the past, our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products. We are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods, including increased competition, loss of certain of our customers, unfavorable changes in our operations, reduced global electronics demand, a deterioration in market conditions including as a result of the global economic downturn, end-customer market downturn, market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products, and litigation. A material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nIf demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve, our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe that the application of our products in the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue. If we are not able to accurately predict new end markets to serve or if the demand for our products declines in our current major end markets, our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as technology evolves, the requirement to integrate the functionalities of various components, including our discrete semiconductor products, onto a single chip and/or onto other components of systems containing our products increases. Should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer, demand for our products could decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nDue to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\nBecause we provide components for end products and systems, demand for our products is influenced by our customers&#8217; end product demand. As a result, we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses. Our expenses and revenue depend on the timing, size, and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products, all of which are inherently difficult to forecast, as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems. In addition, demand for our products is influenced by our customers&#8217; ability to manage their inventory. Our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which, in itself, is inherently difficult to forecast, all of which may be exacerbated by the adverse effects of macroeconomic factors, including increased inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain disruptions, decreased economic output, fluctuations in currency rates, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. If our customers, including distributors, do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers&#8217; demand, our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis, and we may have difficulty forecasting our expenses and inventory levels, which could reduce our revenue, result in inventory write offs, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to, or better than, what we have experienced in the past, which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur success depends on our development and sale of products that are differentiated in the market, with gross margins that have historically been above industry averages. Should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future, and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. A fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets. Our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products, which could result in product obsolescence, decreased revenue, and/or a loss of market share to competitors.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us, such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past. Some of our new product lines require us to re-equip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past. If we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions, we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ntimely and efficient completion of process design and device structure improvements;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ntimely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly, and test processes;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe ability to secure and effectively utilize fabrication capacity in different geometries;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nproduct performance;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nproduct availability;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nproduct quality and reliability; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\neffective marketing, sales and service. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nTo the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements, and value-added resellers, and the loss of any one of these distributors, value-added resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe market our products through distribution arrangements and value-added resellers, and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include OEMs, ODMs and EMS providers. Receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible. Significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any such major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. While we could partner with other distributors or value-added resellers to replace any of our customers, the change in business partners could interrupt our operations and have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nMoreover, we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of OEMs and ODMs. Although we communicate with OEMs and/or ODMs in an attempt to achieve &#8220;design wins,&#8221; which are decisions by OEMs and/or ODMs to incorporate our products, we do not have purchase commitments from these end users. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the OEMs and/or ODMs will continue to incorporate our ICs into their products, even if we secure a design win. OEM technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly, and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had previous design wins. We cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large OEMs, that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the OEMs, or that the OEMs will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ICs. The loss of any significant customer, any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their OEM customers, the cancellation of a significant customer order, or the cancellation or delay of a customer&#8217;s or an OEM&#8217;s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur products must meet specifications, and undetected defects and failures may occur, which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance, energy efficiency and reliability that our products must meet. ICs as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments, which might require product replacement or recall. Further, our third-party manufacturing processes or changes thereto, or changes in the raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail. From time to time, we have experienced product quality, performance or reliability problems. Our standard warranty period is generally one to two years, which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures. If defects and failures occur in our products, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments, and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, product liability claims may be asserted by our customers. Although we currently have insurance, there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage or that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage. Our insurance providers could deny or challenge these claims, and as a result, reimbursement to us is not guaranteed or could be delayed. If coverage is denied, we may not have sufficient resources to pay for these claims. Furthermore, due to recent changes in the insurance industry, we may experience a significant increase in premiums and therefore decide to self-insure, which may not meet the expectations or requirements of certain customers. All of these factors could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBecause of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales. It generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype. Only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins. This sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. Volume production of products that use our ICs, if any, may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale. Sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nour customers usually complete an in-depth technical evaluation of our products before they place a purchase order;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe commercial adoption of our products by OEMs and ODMs is typically limited during the initial release of their product to evaluate product performance and consumer demand;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nour products must be designed into our customers&#8217; products or systems; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe development and commercial introduction of our customers&#8217; products incorporating new technologies are frequently delayed.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nAs a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue. The lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders, particularly as such customers are exposed to economic risks in connection with the global economic downturn. Our sales are made by purchase orders. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales. If customer cancellations or product changes occur, we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Supply and Manufacturing \n\n&#160;\n\nOur ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers. \n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements, their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity, particularly capacity in the geometries we require, at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us . For example, we believe the strong increase in industry-wide demand for electronic equipment for remote work arrangements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and will continue to result, in capacity shortages of our suppliers. As a result, this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth. In addition, an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us. Our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements. If our suppliers extend lead times, limit supplies or the types of capacity we require, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors, our revenue and gross margin may materially decline. In addition, if we experience supply delays or limitations, our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet their demand, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Delays in increasing third-party manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to our third-party suppliers &#8217; manufacturing capacity. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of third-party supply foundries, assembly shops, and testing facilities for our products. In order to facilitate such growth, we may need to enter into strategic transactions, investments and other activities, both with our current suppliers and with new suppliers. Such activities are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe costs and expense associated with such activities, including requirements to make long-term purchase commitments and upfront cash deposits to our suppliers;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe availability of modern foundries to be developed, acquired, leased or otherwise made available to us or our third-party suppliers;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe ability of foundries and our third-party suppliers to obtain the advanced equipment used in the production of our products;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ndelays in identifying and negotiating agreements with new foundries and suppliers; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nenvironmental, engineering or manufacturing qualification problems relating to existing or new foundry facilities, including delays in qualification of new foundries by our customers.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nThese and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our third-party supplier capacity. If our manufacturing costs increase, including as a result of inflationary pressure, or we experience supply constraints, we may be required to raise the prices for our products to remain profitable, which could result in a loss of customers.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe currently depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products. If any of our wafer suppliers are acquired, become insolvent or capacity constrained, or are otherwise unable to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs, our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have supply arrangements with certain suppliers for the production of wafers. Should any of our suppliers be acquired or become insolvent or capacity constrained, we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders, which would likely cause a decline in our revenue.\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile certain aspects of our relationships with these suppliers are contractual, many important aspects of our relationships depend on our suppliers&#8217; continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships. Our relationships could also be negatively impacted by changes in control or changes in the management team of the suppliers. In addition, the fabrication of ICs is a highly complex and precise process. Problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ICs on each wafer to be non-functional. This could potentially reduce yields and supply of our products. The failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressures resulting from worldwide supply chain constraints and other factors, have increased, and may continue to increase the prices we pay to our suppliers. As a result of the increased costs, we have raised, and may be required to further raise the prices of our products in order to remain profitable, which could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenue.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurther, as is common in the semiconductor industry, our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice. If our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers, we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by third-party subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by third-party subcontractors. Also, due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products. In addition, events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and supply chain disruptions may materially impact our assembly suppliers&#8217; ability to operate. Any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as expected, we may have insufficient or excess inventory, which could adversely impact our financial position. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we purchase our inventory from third-party manufacturers in advance of selling our products. We place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products. While most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels, we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers. Some of our customers and distributors may nevertheless cancel orders as a result of the impacts of the global economic downturn, their own specific business challenges or for other reasons. In the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of products within the timeframe that is required, we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customers&#8217; demands. In addition, a perceived negative trend in market conditions could lead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory. If we inaccurately assess market conditions for our products, we would have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands resulting in lost potential revenue. In the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders, unexpected order cancellations, injunctions due to patent litigation, import/export restrictions or product returns, we may have excess inventory which, if not sold, may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold. If any of these situations were to arise, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe price and availability of commodities (e.g., gold, copper and silicon) may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur products incorporate commodities such as gold, copper and silicon. An increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Industry Dynamics and Competition \n\n&#160;\n\nThe highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has resulted in significant and sometimes prolonged downturns, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nHistorically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and, at various times, has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand. These conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity, as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices. The industry may again experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future, which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products. Because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall. Any significant or prolonged downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs, strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company. In addition, companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors of multiple products for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products. We compete with domestic and non-domestic semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products, and, in some cases, may have a broader number of product offerings that enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. The number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably, or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, from time to time, governments may provide subsidies or make other investments that could give competitive advantages to many semiconductor companies. For example, in August 2022, the U.S. enacted the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (the &#8220;CHIPS Act&#8221;), which, among other things, provides funding to increase domestic production and research and development in the semiconductor industry. Because we operate a fabless business model, we do not believe we will be eligible for such investments from the U.S. government. Many of our competitors will benefit from the investments, which will help increase their production capacity, shorten their lead time and gain market share. These competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may face competition from customers developing products internally. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. Some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally. The future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers&#8217; acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products. Future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third-party sourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. Customers may continue to increase their use of internally developed components. They may also decide to develop or acquire components, technologies or products that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products. If our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative, if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products, or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Information Technology ( &#8220; IT &#8221; ) and Cybersecurity \n\n&#160;\n\nImplementation of enhanced enterprise resource planning ( &#8220; ERP &#8221; ) or other IT systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we may implement new ERP software solutions or upgrade existing systems. Implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including system downtime causing interruptions in business operations. In addition, transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources. Difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations and financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSystem security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and/or harm our reputation, and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price. \n\n&#160;\n\nExperienced hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, financial reporting or other critical functions.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data on our internal systems, network and servers, such as proprietary business and financial information, and confidential data pertaining to our customers, suppliers and business partners. Maintaining security of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy. We devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data. However, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions, any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Remote working arrangements and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have also heightened our potential exposure to cyberattacks, which could put the sensitive proprietary and financial information we store on our internal systems at risk. If any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our reputation and relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to risks of litigation and possible significant liability.\n\n&#160;\n\nPortions of our IT infrastructure may also experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales or a loss of customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n\n&#160;\n\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether through breach of our systems, breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or through employee error, theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations, related actions, and penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation and substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international laws, policies and other regulations regarding data protection. \n\n&#160;\n\nPrivacy, cyber security, and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in China and other countries. To address these issues, the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress promulgated the Cyber Security Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (the &#8220;Cyber Security Law&#8221;), which took effect on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data, among other things. On June 10, 2021, the National People&#8217;s Congress passed the Data Security Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (the &#8220;Data Security Law&#8221;), which became effective on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law is the first comprehensive data security legislation in China, which becomes a key supplement to the Cyber Security Law and aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection, storage, processing, use, provision, transaction and publication of any kind of data. Various Chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely. For example, the Personal Information Protection Law (&#8220;PIPL&#8221;), took effect on November 1, 2021. PIPL is aimed at protecting and controlling the use and transfer of personal data in China. Given its recent passage, there is significant uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and enforce the law, but it contains provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for failure to obtain required approval from China&#8217;s cyber and data protection regulators for cross-border transfers of personal data.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEffective May 25, 2018, the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221; ) implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221; ), a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current EU data protection law to non-European Union entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal data of EU subjects. The GDPR allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use, disclose or secure the personal data of EU subjects, including through a data security breach. In addition, an increasing number of states in the U.S. have enacted laws containing similar requirements to GDPR for businesses collecting or processing personal data. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which was significantly amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and sets forth comprehensive privacy and security obligations regarding the collection and processing of personal data of eligible California residents.\n\n&#160;\n\nThese regulatory requirements may increase our costs of compliance. Any failure to fully comply with the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law, PIPL, GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant fines and regulatory corrective actions, along with reputational damage or third-party lawsuits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, data security breaches experienced by us could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive commercial data, and the exposure of personal data (including sensitive personal data) of our employees, customers, suppliers and others. Such incidents could subject us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecution, and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Strategic Investments and Initiatives \n\n&#160;\n\nOur success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development. We may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development. We expect to continue investing heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. Increased investments in research and development will increase our operating expenses, which may negatively impact our operating results, and we may not achieve the return on these investments that we anticipate, or be able to reduce such expenses in a timely manner if we experience a downturn in sales. Also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase further. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. In order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire. In addition, acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders, reduce our cash balances, and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities. As a result of completing acquisitions, we could use a significant portion of our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders&#8217; percentage ownership, or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities. Such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons, including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry, the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust or other policies, laws or regulations. If we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies, businesses or assets include those associated with:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nunexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired companies or businesses;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nintegrating the acquired company&#8217;s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ncoordinating new product and process development;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nhiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ndifficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ndifficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe risk of undisclosed liabilities of the acquired businesses and potential legal disputes with founders or stockholders of acquired companies;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nour inability to commercialize acquired technologies;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nthe risk that the future business potential as projected is not realized and as a result, we may be required to take an impairment charge related to goodwill or acquired intangibles that would impact our profitability;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ndifficulties in assessing the fair value of earn-out arrangements;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ndiversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nAlternatively, third parties may be interested in acquiring us. We will continue to consider, evaluate and negotiate any such transactions as our board of directors deems appropriate and in the best interest of our stockholders. Such potential transactions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating, evaluating and negotiating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Financial Reporting \n\n&#160;\n\nThe complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nDue to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision, including the effects of the enactment of new tax laws, we engage third-party tax advisors to assist us in the calculation. If we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future, we could be subject to errors, which, if material, would result in us having to restate our financial statements. Restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations, damage our reputation, and/or have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items. In addition, we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) and tax authorities in various jurisdictions where we have business operations. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur international operations subject us to potentially significant tax consequences, which could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, branches and representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing, permanent establishment challenges and other local regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our positions were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, resulting in higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Additionally, our future worldwide tax rate and financial position may be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws, interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts, including in the EU and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n&#160;\n\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct, our business and operating results could be harmed. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. This, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and/or have a negative impact on our reputation and the trading price of our common stock, and could subject us to stockholder litigation. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Regulatory Compliance, Intellectual Property Protection and Litigation \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#160;&#8220; FCPA &#8221; ) and the U.K. Bribery Act. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under these laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We have significant operations in Asia, which place us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered &#8220;foreign officials&#8221; under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, resulting in an elevated risk of potential violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including restatements of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation or allegations of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading activities or technology transfers, we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the U.S. and other countries we conduct business in, including export control laws such as the Export Administration Act, the Export Administration Regulations and other laws, regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance.\n\n&#160;\n\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, including various EU member countries and countries in Asia. There can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs, possible delays in delivering products, and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the costs were to become prohibitive.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to increasing regulatory and reporting standards related to ESG matters, which could increase our expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\nRecently, there has been an increase in public awareness from regulators, investors and other key stakeholders focusing on ESG compliance efforts, including those related to environmental sustainability and social responsibility. For example, the SEC has proposed a new rule that would require public companies to provide detailed reporting of their climate-related risks, emissions, and net-zero transition plans, and many of our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other non-standard compliance requirements in their contracts with us. While we are fully committed to making our business sustainable and keeping our stakeholders engaged by maintaining strong ESG strategies, practices, processes, policies and disclosures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our goals, or that our compliance initiatives will be deemed sufficiently robust by regulators and other key stakeholders. Furthermore, our compliance efforts, including the collection, assessment and reporting of ESG data, are subject to evolving reporting standards and can be costly, complex and time-consuming. In addition, climate change concerns and the potential associated environmental impact could result in the proposal and passage of additional laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that may affect us, our suppliers and customers. Such laws and regulations could cause us to incur additional compliance costs, and failure to comply with the regulatory standards in a timely manner could result in penalties and fines. These operational, legal, compliance and other risks could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers, we could be prevented from selling many of our products and/or be required to pay substantial damages. An unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages, attorneys &#8217; fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings. If we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers, we could be ordered to pay monetary fines and/or damages. If we are found liable for willful patent infringement, damages could be significant. We and/or our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products. Moreover, our customers and end users could decide not to use our products, and our products and our customers&#8217; accounts payable to us could be seized. Finally, interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings. Even if resolved favorably, such proceedings can be very expensive and time consuming, and may divert management&#8217;s attention from other business operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nGiven our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise, our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter, which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition. \n\n&#160;\n\nHistorically, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding. It is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter, which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general. We may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings, which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses. If we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses, our stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nFuture legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves, and in some circumstances our key customers or suppliers, against additional infringement claims. Such litigation is very costly. Further, in connection with these legal proceedings, we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time, until such dispute is resolved. If our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts, our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses, we may have to cease production of certain products, design around such technologies, or pay royalty payments, any of which could harm our financial condition and our business. Our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings, which could divert management&#8217;s attention from focusing on our operations, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nFailure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products. We pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies, and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees&#8217; commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. Despite the precautions we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies, including through patents. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business. \n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Human Capital Management \n\n&#160;\n\nThe loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. We are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives, including Michael Hsing, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology. In addition, personnel with highly skilled analog and mixed-signal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future. If we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business, including design cycles, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we lose key personnel, the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources, and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to effectively integrate into the team.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf we fail to retain key employees in our sales, applications, finance and legal functions or to make continued improvements to our internal systems, our business may suffer. \n\n&#160;\n\nIf we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales, applications, financial and legal positions, maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business, our ability to operate effectively will suffer. The operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees, as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and, if they were to terminate their employment, our sales, operations and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock \n\n&#160;\n\nThe future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nactual or anticipated results of operations and financial performance, including our ability to accurately forecast future demand for our products;\n\n&#160;

These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If we fail to meet the expectations of these analysts, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n\n&#160;\n\nShort positions in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nHistorically, there have been &#8220;short&#8221; positions in our common stock. The anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline. Such stock price decreases could encourage further short-sales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price. This could lead to further increases in the existing short position in our common stock and cause decreases and volatility in our stock price. The volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder&#8217;s investment to decline rapidly. Additionally, if our stock price declines, it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and on the return achieved by our stockholders.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf we issue additional shares of stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition. We also issue restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) to employees, which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting. Any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may require additional regulatory compliance, such as stockholder approval.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\n&#160;\n\nThe effects of global pandemics such as COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe face various risks related to epidemics and pandemics, including the global outbreak of COVID-19 first identified in December 2019. Since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020, it has resulted in significant disruptions and uncertainties in the global economy and in the financial markets. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material and adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition, the ongoing effect of the pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on numerous evolving developments, including the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and the introduction of new variants, and the impact on our customers, employees, suppliers and other partners, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict at this time. Furthermore, due to the complexity and variability of COVID-19 policies and regulations imposed by different countries where we operate, we are subject to significant compliance efforts which could require additional resources and result in increased costs, or we may fail to be in compliance on a timely manner. A prolonged outbreak could negatively affect our business, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nunpredictability in demand, pricing and costs for our products, and losses of significant contracts or key customers as a result of a global economic downturn caused by the pandemic;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nour ability to accurately forecast our results of operation, including products sales and market demand for our products;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nreductions or delays in production levels, qualification activities with our customers, and valuation of our inventory due to changes in forecasted demand and our outlook on market conditions;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\ndisruptions to our distribution channels and supply chain in connection with the sourcing of materials from geographic areas that have been impacted by the pandemic;\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nincreased costs resulting from work-from-home and other measures we have enacted at certain of our locations around the world, and increased cyber security risks due to these remote working arrangements; and\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226;\n\nlosses on our investments due to defaults on payments by the issuers, write-offs of our accounts receivable due to defaults and insolvency, or significant delays in payments by our customers.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nWe have worked, and will continue to work, with our stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and employees, to address the continuing impact of this global pandemic. We will continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the pandemic, including limitations imposed by governmental authorities on our ability to return to normal operating practices. These effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur worldwide operations are subject to economic and geopolitical uncertainty, health risks, climate crises and other natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur offices in California and Washington, the production facilities of our third-party wafer suppliers, our IC testing and manufacturing facilities, a portion of our assembly and research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes. We do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Much of our revenue, as well as our manufacturers and assemblers, are concentrated in Asia, particularly in China. Such concentration increases the risk that earthquakes or other natural disasters, labor strikes, epidemics and pandemics, and/or health advisories could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2022, China experienced a severe heatwave during the summer months in the Sichuan province, which resulted in widespread power shortages, rolling backouts and temporary business shutdowns imposed by the local governments. Although we were able to successfully execute our contingency plan and our operations were not materially and adversely disrupted by the events, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the operational risks caused by extreme weather conditions or other events in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively. Any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruptions. System-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurthermore, worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The U.S. and other regions where we conduct business in have been and may continue to be affected by conflicts that could, among other things, disrupt our supply chain, and impact customer demands and component prices. For example, the U.S. and other countries have recently imposed economic sanctions and export control measures on Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine. Although such measures have not significantly affected our business or operations, future developments could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "

This discussion and analysis contain, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n&#160;\n\nDiscussions of 2020 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are omitted in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nOverview \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are a fabless company with a global footprint that provides high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic solutions. Incorporated in 1997, our three core strengths include deep system-level knowledge, strong semiconductor expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the areas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages enable us to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions found in storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to reduce energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life. We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. We are not immune from industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term. Historically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this trend.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths.\n\n&#160;\n\nFollowing the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. Typical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. These factors, combined with the fact that our customers can cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in Asia, where our products are incorporated into end-user products. Our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia was 86%, 90% and 91% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. We believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\n\n&#160;\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business \n\n&#160;\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world. Our primary focus is to continue to execute our business plan and mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position and operations, while actively taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, our suppliers and our customers. The pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our overall operating results or business operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2022, China has continued to experience outbreaks, specifically in Shanghai and Chengdu where we have business operations and where many of our customers and suppliers are located. Local governments have implemented, and may continue to implement, strict measures including quarantines, shutdowns and other business restrictions, which have resulted in logistics challenges throughout China. Although these strict measures and the disruptions, as a result thereof, did not have a material adverse impact on our operations in 2022, we will continue to monitor and evaluate future developments. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential effect of these measures on the global economy, the semiconductor industry and our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have worked, and are continuing to actively work, with our stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and employees, to address the impact of the pandemic. We will continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences to the extent feasible. A prolonged economic slowdown as a result of the pandemic, or otherwise, could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition for 2023 and beyond.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict \n\n&#160;\n\nAs the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to evolve, we are closely monitoring the impact of future developments on our business, supply chain, employees, customers and other business partners. Our total revenue in Russia has historically not been material and we have stopped shipping to customers in Russia. All accounts receivable balances from our customers in Russia have been paid. \n\n&#160;\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions and Recent Regulations \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring 2022, the semiconductor industry faced a number of macro-economic challenges including the impact of supply chain capacity constraints, wide swings in customer demand, rising inflation, increased interest rates, and fluctuations in currency rates. We remain cautious in light of changing macroeconomic conditions and will continue to monitor potential impact on our operations. The implications of macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position remain uncertain.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere also have been recent changes to export control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements. As of December 31, 2022 and through the date we filed this Annual Report, there have been a number of additional trade restrictions introduced. To date, those restrictions have had an immaterial impact on our revenue and operations. We will continue to monitor any changes to export control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements and are committed to complying with all applicable trade laws, regulations and other requirements.\n\n&#160;\n\nCybersecurity Risk Management \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are committed to protecting our IT assets, including computers, systems, corporate networks and sensitive data, from unauthorized access or attack. We have established an internal global IT policy handbook as well as IT security management control procedures designed to:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679;\n\nCreate information security awareness and define responsibilities among our employees and business partners;\n\n&#9679;\n\nImplement controls to identify IT risks and monitor the use of our systems and information resources;\n\n&#9679;\n\nEstablish key policies and processes to adequately and timely respond to security threats;\n\n&#9679;\n\nMaintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans; and\n\n&#9679;\n\nEnsure compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding the management of information security.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nWe require all new employees to attend an IT security training orientation. In addition, on a regular basis, our IT team updates training materials related to our policies and procedures and shares news and articles related to cybersecurity awareness, both of which are stored on our intranet and available to all employees. We also currently maintain an insurance policy that provides certain coverage for losses we incur due to data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur IT Steering Committee, which consists of our senior management and IT team, meets on a regular basis to review initiatives and projects to improve IT security, as well as resources and budgets for our cybersecurity compliance and education efforts. In 2021, we completed the ISO 27001 certification, a globally recognized information security standard.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of three independent members, is responsible for the oversight of our cybersecurity risk program. At least quarterly, the Audit Committee reviews reports and updates from our Chief Financial Officer and IT senior management about major risk exposures, their potential impact on our business operations, and management&#8217;s strategies to assess, monitor and mitigate those risks. The Audit Committee also provides updates of their oversight and findings to the Board of Directors. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe we have adequate resources and sufficient policies, procedures and oversight in place to identify and manage our IT security risks to our business operations. To date, we do not believe we have experienced any material information security breaches and have not incurred significant operating expenses related to information security breaches.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n&#160;\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventories, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable, and depend upon, among other things, many factors outside of our control, including demand for our products, economic conditions and other current and future events, such as macroeconomic factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic downturn and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require our management to update the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements . As new events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, any changes to these estimates and assumptions will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue Recognition &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe account for price adjustments and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price, and recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized. Four U.S.-based distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by us. When we receive claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower price, we issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments. We estimate the price adjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims, at both the distributor and product level, as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix. \n\n&#160;\n\nCertain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months&#8217; purchases in accordance with the contract terms. We estimate the stock rotation returns using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns, and the current level of inventory in the distribution channel. \n\n&#160;\n\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management&#8217;s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nInventory Valuation \n\n&#160;\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost determined on a first-in first-out basis) and estimated net realizable value. We write down excess and obsolete inventories based on their age and forecasted demand, which includes estimates taking into consideration our revenue forecast, outlook on market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Conversely, if actual demand or market conditions are more favorable, inventories may be sold that were previously written down. \n\n&#160;\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty, finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $20.3 million and $19.5 million, respectively, attributable to management&#8217;s determination that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax assets valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nContingencies \n\n&#160;\n\nWe record a contingent liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Based on the facts and circumstances in each matter, the determination of such liability requires significant judgment. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\n&#160;\n\nFor equity awards with performance conditions, as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved. Management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts, and internal factors, such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts. Changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. If the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement, additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catch-up adjustment, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Conversely, if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement, previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards, which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations. As a result, our stock-based compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions or actual results being different from projections made by management.\n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nResults of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

The increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in the average selling prices resulting primarily from the sale of higher value products and increases in shipment volume.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue from the storage and computing market increased $196.7 million, or 76.8%, from the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by strong sales growth for storage applications and enterprise notebooks. Revenue from the enterprise data market increased $135.1 million, or 116.1%, from the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for cloud-based CPU and GPU server applications. Revenue from the automotive market increased $95.7 million, or 46.8%, from the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting automated driver assistance systems, digital cockpits and connectivity. Revenue from the industrial market increased $34.4 million, or 18.6%, from the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher sales in applications for smart meters and industrial automation. Revenue from the communications market increased $87.4 million, or 53.2%, from the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher sales of products for both 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications. Revenue from the consumer market increased $37.2 million, or 13.2%, from the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales for home appliances, gaming consoles and smart TVs.\n\n&#160;\n\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as warranty costs, inventory-related and other overhead costs, and stock-based compensation expenses. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; Change \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; From 2021 to &#160; &#160; From 2020 to &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands, except percentages)\n\n&#160; Cost of revenue\n\n&#160; $ 745,596 &#160; &#160; $ 522,339 &#160; &#160; $ 378,498 &#160; &#160; &#160; 42.7 % &#160; &#160; 38.0 % As a percentage of revenue\n\n&#160; &#160; 41.6 % &#160; &#160; 43.2 % &#160; &#160; 44.8 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross profit\n\n&#160; $ 1,048,552 &#160; &#160; $ 685,459 &#160; &#160; $ 465,954 &#160; &#160; &#160; 53.0 % &#160; &#160; 47.1 % Gross margin\n\n&#160; &#160; 58.4 % &#160; &#160; 56.8 % &#160; &#160; 55.2 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nCost of revenue was $745.6 million, or 41.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $522.3 million, or 43.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $223.3 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased shipment volume, product mix, increases in manufacturing overhead costs and increased input cost. \n\n&#160;\n\nGross margin was 58.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 56.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross margin was mainly driven by lower warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue and a favorable product mix. \n\n&#160;\n\nResearch and Development ( &#8220; R&#38;D &#8221; ) \n\n&#160;\n\nR&#38;D expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses, bonuses, stock-based compensation and deferred compensation for design and product engineers, expenses related to new product development and supplies, and facility costs. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; Change \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; From 2021 to &#160; &#160; From 2020 to &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands, except percentages)\n\n&#160; R&#38;D expenses\n\n&#160; $ 240,171 &#160; &#160; $ 190,627 &#160; &#160; $ 137,598 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26.0 % &#160; &#160; 38.5 % As a percentage of revenue\n\n&#160; &#160; 13.4 % &#160; &#160; 15.8 % &#160; &#160; 16.3 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nR&#38;D expenses were $240.2 million, or 13.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $190.6 million, or 15.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $49.6 million increase in R&#38;D expenses was primarily due to an increase of $40.1 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, and an increase of $9.3 million in stock-based compensation expenses, which were mainly associated with performance-based equity awards. The increase was partially offset by a $4.7 million benefit related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan liabilities. Our R&#38;D headcount was 1,328 employees as of December 31, 2022, compared with 1,087 employees as of December 31, 2021. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSelling, General and Administrative ( &#8220; SG&#38;A &#8221; ) \n\n&#160;\n\nSG&#38;A expenses primarily include salary and benefit expenses, bonuses, stock-based compensation and deferred compensation for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales commissions, travel expenses, facilities costs, and professional service fees. \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; Change \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; From 2021 to &#160; &#160; From 2020 to &#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands, except percentages)\n\n&#160; SG&#38;A expenses\n\n&#160; $ 273,595 &#160; &#160; $ 226,190 &#160; &#160; $ 161,670 &#160; &#160; &#160; 21.0 % &#160; &#160; 39.9 % As a percentage of revenue\n\n&#160; &#160; 15.2 % &#160; &#160; 18.7 % &#160; &#160; 19.1 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nSG&#38;A expenses were $273.6 million, or 15.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $226.2 million, or 18.7% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $47.4 million increase in SG&#38;A expenses was primarily due to an increase of $27.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses, which were mainly associated with performance-based equity awards, and $20.7 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses. The increase was partially offset by a $7.2 million benefit related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan liabilities. Our SG&#38;A headcount was 780 employees as of December 31, 2022, compared with 688 employees as of December 31, 2021. \n\n&#160;\n\nLitigation Expense, Net \n\n&#160;\n\nLitigation expense was $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with litigation expense, net, of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The expense for both periods was attributable to litigation activity related to ongoing patent infringement and other matters.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\n&#160;\n\nOther expense, net, was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with other income, net, of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase of $11.2 million in expense related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan investments and an increase of $4.4 million in charitable contributions, which was partially offset by an increase of $3.0 million in net interest income.\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\n&#160;\n\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $87.3 million, or 16.6% of pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) tax.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $30.2 million, or 11.1% of pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates. The decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the GILTI tax.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to an increase in GILTI inclusion due to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;IRC&#8221;) and lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase was partially offset by higher foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China taxed at lower statutory tax rates.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn August 2022, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) were enacted and signed into law, which did not have a material impact on our income tax provisions, results of operations or financial condition for the year ending December 31, 2022. We will continue to monitor any new developments related to the CHIPS Act and the IRA and evaluate their impact on our financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands, except percentages)\n\n&#160; Cash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160; $ 288,607 &#160; &#160; $ 189,265 &#160; Short-term investments\n\n&#160; &#160; 449,266 &#160; &#160; &#160; 535,817 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n\n&#160; $ 737,873 &#160; &#160; $ 725,082 &#160; Percentage of total assets\n\n&#160; &#160; 35.8 % &#160; &#160; 45.7 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total current assets\n\n&#160; $ 1,410,619 &#160; &#160; $ 1,124,852 &#160; Total current liabilities\n\n&#160; &#160; (263,400 ) &#160; &#160; (226,944 ) Working capital\n\n&#160; $ 1,147,219 &#160; &#160; $ 897,908 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $288.6 million and short-term investments of $449.3 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $189.3 million and short-term investments of $535.8 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, $253.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $270.4 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries.

There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning capital investments and potential acquisitions of product lines, technologies, businesses and companies, and we continue to consider potential investments and acquisition candidates. Any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities, assumptions of debt, and/or payment of cash consideration. We may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such investments or acquisitions, through either the issuance of equity and/or debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets. If we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution. \n\n&#160;\n\nCash Requirements \n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough consequences of economic uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions and other factors could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, and cash requirements may fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that our balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $737.9 million as of December 31, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\n\n&#160;\n\nPurchase Obligations \n\n&#160;\n\nPurchase obligations represent our obligations with our suppliers and other parties that require the purchases of goods or services, which primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction of manufacturing and R&#38;D facilities, purchases of production and other equipment, and license arrangements.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn May 2022, we entered into a long-term supply agreement in order to secure manufacturing production capacity for silicon wafers over a four-year period. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had made prepayments under this agreement of $170.0 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, total estimated future unconditional purchase commitments to all suppliers and other parties were $1.1 billion, of which $455.4 million was short-term.\n\n&#160;\n\nTransition Tax Liability \n\n&#160;\n\nThe transition tax liability represents the one-time, mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously deferred foreign earnings under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (&#8220;2017 Tax Act&#8221;) . As permitted by the 2017 Tax Act, we have elected to pay the tax liability in installments on an interest-free basis through 2025. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining liability totaled $14.8 million, of which $3.7 million was short-term.\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Leases \n\n&#160;\n\nOperating lease obligations represent the undiscounted remaining lease payments primarily for our leased facilities and equipment. As of December 31, 2022, these obligations totaled $3.8 million, of which $2.1 million was short-term.\n\n&#160;\n\nDividends \n\n&#160;\n\nWe currently have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Based on our historical practice, stockholders of record as of the last business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors, which are payable to the stockholders in the following month. As of December 31, 2022, accrued dividends totaled $35.3 million. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.75 per share to $1.00 per share, which amount will be paid on April 14, 2023 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 31, 2023.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Long-Term Obligations \n\n&#160;\n\nOther long-term obligations primarily include payments for deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, these obligations totaled $71.7 million.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "

Our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Such guidelines include security type, credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short-term maturities. Based on our investment positions as of December 31, 2022, the impact of changes in interest rates on our interest income was immaterial.\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the fair value of an investment is below its amortized cost basis, unrealized losses due to changes in interest rates (i.e., non-credit loss factors) are not recognized in our results of operations unless we have the intent to sell the securities or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. Based on our investment positions as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $3.2 million decline in the fair value of our investments. Any losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\n\n&#160;\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \n\n&#160;\n\nOur sales outside the United States are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars through our subsidiary in Bermuda. Accordingly, our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. The functional currency of our offshore operations is generally the local currency, primarily including the Renminbi, the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including intercompany transactions between the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Gains or losses from the remeasurement and settlement of the balances are reported in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#160;\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\n&#160;\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Inventory Valuation \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; Description of the Matter\n\n&#160; The Company&#8217;s inventories totaled $447.3 million as of December 31, 2022, representing 21.7% of total assets. As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company values inventories at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost determined on a first-in first-out basis) and estimated net realizable value in each reporting period. Excess and obsolete inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Auditing management&#8217;s estimates for excess and obsolete inventory involved subjective auditor judgment because management&#8217;s assessment of whether a write down is required and the measurement of any excess of cost over net realizable value is judgmental and considers a number of qualitative factors that are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company&#8217;s control. In particular, the excess and obsolete inventory calculations are sensitive to significant assumptions, including demand for the Company&#8217;s products, which considers adjustments to sales forecasts for specific product considerations, including but not limited to new product launches and expected industry sales growth. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n&#160; We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's excess and obsolete inventory write down process. This included controls over management&#8217;s assessment of inventory valuation, including the determination of forecasted usage of inventories. \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Our substantive audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions stated above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management&#8217;s excess and obsolete inventory valuation assessment. We evaluated inventory levels compared to forecasted product demand, historical sales and specific product considerations. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management&#8217;s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the excess and obsolete inventory estimates that would result from changes in the underlying assumptions.\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\n\n&#160;\n\nSan Jose, California \n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\n&#160;\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\n\n&#160;\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have audited Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n&#160;\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#160;\n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38;

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160;\n\nBusiness \n\n&#160;\n\nMonolithic Power Systems, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of California on August 22, 1997. On November 17, 2004, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware. MPS designs, develops and markets high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic solutions. MPS&#8217;s mission is to provide innovative power solutions in the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets.\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis of Presentation \n\n&#160;\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n&#160;\n\nUse of Estimates \n\n&#160;\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements primarily include those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, valuation of share-based awards, contingencies and income tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and any such differences may be material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\n&#160;\n\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties \n\n&#160;\n\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company&#8217;s cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less. The Company&#8217;s short-term investments may consist of corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agency bonds and treasuries, and the long-term investments consist of government-backed student loan auction-rate securities and non-marketable equity investments.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company does not require its customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable. The Company assesses the collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a customer-by-customer basis. To manage credit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of the customers&#8217; financial condition, monitors payment performance, and assesses current economic conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, that may affect collectability of the outstanding receivables. For certain high-risk customers, the Company requires standby letters of credit or advance payment prior to shipments of goods.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company participates in the dynamic high technology industry and believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect on its future financial position, results of operations or cash flows: advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; competitive pressures in the form of new products or price reductions on current products; changes in product mix; changes in the overall demand for products offered by the Company; changes in third -party manufacturers or the terms of such arrangements; changes in key suppliers; changes in certain strategic relationships or customer relationships; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, patent, product, regulatory or other factors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; risk associated with changes in government policies and regulations on trade restrictions and corporate taxes; availability of necessary components or sub-assemblies; availability of foundry capacity; ability to integrate acquired companies; and the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Currency &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIn general, the functional currency of the Company&#8217;s international subsidiaries is the local currency. The primary subsidiaries are located in China, Taiwan and Europe, which utilize the Renminbi, the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro as their currencies, respectively. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, the Company incurs foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including intercompany transactions, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. In connection with the remeasurement and settlement of the balances, the Company recorded foreign currency exchange gain (loss) of $ 0.5 million, $( 0.7 ) million and $( 1.4 ) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were reported in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, the Company records the foreign currency exchange gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n&#160;\n\nCash Equivalents and Debt Investments &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents. The Company may classify investments with maturities beyond one year as short-term based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nCash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. The Company&#8217;s short-term and long-term debt investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are stated at their fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Premiums and discounts on debt investments are generally amortized or accreted over the life of the related available-for-sale securities. Interest income is recognized when earned. The cost of investments sold is determined on a specific identification method.\n\n&#160;\n\nAvailable-for-sale investments are subject to impairment reviews when the fair value is below the amortized cost basis. If the Company determines that the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors, the impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. An impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company intends to sell the impaired investments, or more likely than not will be required to sell such investments before recovering the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis.\n\n&#160;\n\nEquity Investments \n\n&#160;\n\nEquity investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the measurement alternative method, provided that the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence or control over the investees. Under this method, the Company measures the investments at cost, less any impairment, and adjusts the carrying value of the investments to fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The Company records the investments in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses on the investments are recognized in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company monitors its non-marketable equity investments for impairment indicators, such as negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. If indicators exist for a security and the fair value is below the carrying amount, the Company writes down the security to fair value.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\n&#160;\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;\n\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data.\n\n##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;\n\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and typically reflect management&#8217;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nInventories \n\n&#160;\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost determined on a first -in first -out basis) and estimated net realizable value. The Company writes down excess and obsolete inventories based on their age and forecasted demand, which includes estimates taking into consideration the Company&#8217;s revenue forecast, outlook on market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. When the Company records a write-down on inventory, it establishes a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances will not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\n&#160;\n\nProperty and Equipment \n\n&#160;\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation commences when an asset is placed in service and available for its intended use. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Buildings and building improvements have estimated useful lives of 20 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease period. Production equipment and software have estimated useful lives of three to eight years. Transportation equipment has estimated useful lives of 5 to 20 years. Furniture and fixtures have estimated useful lives of three to five years. Land is not depreciated.\n\n&#160;\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company did not record material impairments in any of the periods presented.\n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill \n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identified intangible assets as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company has elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the impairment loss. No impairment of goodwill has been identified in any of the periods presented. \n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred Compensation Plan &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan, which provides certain key employees, including executive officers, with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax deferred basis. The Company does not make contributions to the plan or guarantee returns on the investments. The Company is responsible for the plan&#8217;s administrative expenses. Participants&#8217; deferrals and investment gains and losses remain as the Company&#8217;s liabilities and the underlying assets are subject to claims of general creditors.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; The liabilities for compensation deferred under the plan are recorded at fair value in each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the liabilities are included in operating expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the risk of changes in the fair value of the liabilities by electing to match the liabilities with investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies, mutual funds and money market funds that offset a substantial portion of the exposure. The investments are recorded at the cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies, and at the fair value of the mutual funds and money market funds, which are classified as trading securities. Changes in the cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies and the fair value of mutual fund and money market fund investments are included in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the deferred compensation plan balances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; Deferred compensation plan asset components:\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies\n\n&#160; $ 19,089 &#160; &#160; $ 21,386 &#160; Fair value of mutual funds and money market funds\n\n&#160; &#160; 43,933 &#160; &#160; &#160; 31,786 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 63,022 &#160; &#160; $ 53,172 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred compensation plan assets reported in:\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other long-term assets\n\n&#160; $ 63,022 &#160; &#160; $ 53,172 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred compensation plan liabilities reported in:\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Accrued compensation and related benefits (short-term)\n\n&#160; $ 118 &#160; &#160; $ 282 &#160; Other long-term liabilities\n\n&#160; &#160; 64,863 &#160; &#160; &#160; 55,489 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 64,981 &#160; &#160; $ 55,771 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of promised goods or services to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2 for further discussion.\n\n&#160;\n\nR&#38;D \n\n&#160;\n\nCosts incurred in R&#38;D are expensed as incurred.\n\n&#160;\n\nWarranty Reserve \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company generally provides one to two -year warranties against defects in materials and workmanship and will repair the products, provide replacements at no charge to customers or issue a refund. As they are considered assurance-type warranties, the Company does not account for them as separate performance obligations. Warranty reserve requirements are generally based on a specific assessment of the products sold with warranties when a customer asserts a claim for warranty or a product defect. \n\n&#160;\n\nLeases \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets represent the Company&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the Company&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, less lease incentives received. Because the implicit rate in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the remaining lease payment. The Company recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company does not record short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For lease arrangements that contain lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for them as single lease components.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor lease arrangements where the Company is the lessor, the Company recognizes lease income from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of RSUs with only service conditions is determined based on the grant date stock price. The fair value of all other awards is determined based on the following valuation methods:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Type of Awards \n\n&#160; Valuation Method &#160;\n\nRSUs with performance conditions (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;)\n\n&#160; Black-Scholes model\n\nRSUs with market conditions (&#8220;MSUs&#8221;)\n\n&#160; Monte Carlo simulation model\n\nRSUs with both performance and market conditions (&#8220;MPSUs&#8221;)\n\n&#160; Monte Carlo simulation model\n\nShares issued under the employee stock purchase plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;)\n\n&#160; Black-Scholes model\n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nThe valuation models consider inputs including stock price, expected volatility, expected term of awards, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected volatility used in the models is determined based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price for the period, which corresponds to the expected term of the awards, immediately preceding the granting of the awards.\n\n&#160;\n\nCompensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Compensation expense related to awards subject to performance or market conditions is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche. For awards with only market conditions, compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied. For awards with only performance conditions, as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions, the Company recognizes compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved. Management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts, and internal factors, such as the Company&#8217;s business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts. Changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. Any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed if the performance conditions are not expected to be satisfied as a result of management&#8217;s assessment.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures of equity awards when they occur.\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company recognizes federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on its estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. The Company also recognizes federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for its estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. The Company&#8217;s estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty, finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, the Company recognizes liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on its tax returns if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If the Company determines that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than its current assessment, the Company may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in its financial statements in the period such determination is made. The Company has calculated its uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments.\n\n&#160;\n\nLitigation and Contingencies \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including challenges to the enforceability or validity of its intellectual property, claims that the Company&#8217;s products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. The Company may also be subject to litigation initiated by its stockholders. The pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. In addition, from time to time, the Company becomes aware that it is subject to other contingent liabilities. When this occurs, the Company will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the facts and circumstances in each matter, the Company uses its judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. If the Company determines a loss is probable and estimable, the Company records a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, the Company takes into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, the Company may need to record additional contingent losses. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Litigation expense, net, recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations includes primarily patent infringement litigation and other business matters. The Company records litigation costs in the period in which they are incurred. Proceeds resulting from settlement of litigation or favorable judgments are recorded as a reduction against litigation expense.\n\n&#160;\n\nNet Income per Share \n\n&#160;\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common shares, and calculated using the treasury stock method. Contingently issuable shares, including equity awards with performance conditions or market conditions, are considered outstanding common shares and included in the basic net income per share as of the date that all necessary conditions to earn the awards have been satisfied. Prior to the end of the contingency period, the number of contingently issuable shares included in the diluted net income per share is based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms of the arrangement at the end of the reporting period.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s RSUs contain forfeitable rights to receive cash dividend equivalents, which are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill the requisite service requirement and, as a result, the awards do not vest. Accordingly, these awards are not treated as participating securities in the net income per share calculation. \n\n&#160;\n\nComprehensive Income &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nComprehensive income represents the change in the Company&#8217;s net assets during the period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily consists of unrealized gains or losses related to available-for-sale investments and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted as of December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021 - 08, Business Combinations (Topic 805 ): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The standard requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( &#8220; Topic 606 &#8221; ) . The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim period within those fiscal years, and is applied prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\n2. REVENUE RECOGNITION \n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue from Product Sales \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from product sales, which include assembled and tested ICs, as well as dies in wafer form. These product sales accounted for 98 %, 97 % and 97 % of the Company&#8217;s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The remaining revenue primarily includes royalty revenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third parties, which have not been significant for the periods presented. See Note 15 for the disaggregation of the Company&#8217;s revenue by geographic regions and by product families.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company sells its products primarily through third -party distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, ODMs and EMS providers. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , &#160; 83 %, 88 % and 81 %, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s product sales were made through distribution arrangements. These distribution arrangements contain enforceable rights and obligations specific to those distributors and not the end customers. Purchase orders, which are generally governed by sales agreements or the Company's standard terms of sale, set the final terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment agreed by both parties. The Company considers purchase orders to be the contracts with customers. The unit price as stated on the purchase orders is considered the observable, stand-alone selling price for the arrangements.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company excludes taxes assessed by government authorities, such as sales taxes, from revenue.\n\n&#160;\n\nProduct sales consist of a single performance obligation that the Company satisfies at a point in time. The Company recognizes product revenue from distributors and direct end customers when the following events have occurred: (a) the Company has transferred physical possession of the products, (b) the Company has a present right to payment, (c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products. In accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts, these criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from the Company&#8217;s facilities (such as the &#8220;Ex Works&#8221; shipping term) or delivered to the customers&#8217; locations (such as the &#8220;Delivered Duty Paid&#8221; shipping term).\n\n&#160;\n\nUnder certain consignment agreements, revenue is not recognized when the products are shipped and delivered to be held at customers&#8217; designated locations because the Company continues to control the products and retain ownership, and the customers do not have an unconditional obligation to pay. The Company recognizes revenue when the customers consume the products from the consigned inventory locations or, in some cases, after a 60 -day period from the delivery date has passed, at which time control transfers to the customers and the Company invoices them for payment.\n\n&#160;\n\nVariable Consideration \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company accounts for price adjustment and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price and recognizes that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized. Four U.S.-based distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell the Company&#8217;s products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by the Company. When the Company receives claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower prices, the Company issues the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments. The Company estimates the price adjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims, at both the distributor and product level, as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix. Other U.S. distributors and non-U.S. distributors do not have price adjustment rights. The Company records a credit against accounts receivable for the estimated price adjustments, with a corresponding reduction to revenue.\n\n&#160;\n\nCertain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months&#8217; purchases in accordance with the contract terms. The Company estimates the stock rotation returns using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns, and the current level of inventory in the distribution channel. The Company records a liability for the stock rotation reserve, with a corresponding reduction to revenue. In addition, the Company recognizes an asset for product returns which represents the right to recover products from the customers related to stock rotations, with a corresponding reduction to cost of revenue.\n\n&#160;\n\nContract Balances \n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts Receivable: \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company records a receivable when it has an unconditional right to receive consideration after the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , accounts receivable totaled $ 182.7 million and $ 104.8 million, respectively. The Company's accounts receivable are short-term, with standard payment terms generally ranging from 30 to 90 days. The Company did not recognize any write-offs of accounts receivable or record any allowance for credit losses for the periods presented. \n\n&#160;\n\nContract Liabilities: \n\n&#160;\n\nFor certain customers located in Asia, the Company requires cash payments two weeks before the products are scheduled to be shipped to the customers. The Company records these payments received in advance of performance as customer prepayments within current accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , customer prepayments totaled $ 3.6 million and $ 4.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the customer prepayment balance for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from a decrease in unfulfilled customer orders for which the Company has received payments. For the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company recognized $ 4.3 million of revenue that was included in the customer prepayment balance as of December 31, 2021 . \n\n&#160;\n\nPractical Expedients \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s standard payment terms generally require customers to pay 30 to 90 days after the Company satisfies the performance obligations. For those customers who are required to pay in advance, the Company satisfies the performance obligations generally within a quarter. The Company has elected not to determine whether contracts with customers contain significant financing components.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s unsatisfied performance obligations primarily include products held in consignment arrangements and customer purchase orders for products that the Company has not yet shipped.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not consider the impairment of its investments to be a result of credit losses. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company&#8217;s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. When evaluating a debt security for impairment, management reviews factors such as the Company&#8217;s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and the credit quality of the investment.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s auction-rate securities are backed by pools of student loans supported by guarantees by the U.S. Department of Education. The underlying maturities of these securities are up to 23 years. The Company has received all scheduled interest payments on a timely basis pursuant to the terms and conditions of the securities. The Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities, before recovery of its amortized cost basis. To date, the Company has redeemed $ 41.5 million, or 96 % of the original portfolio in these auction-rate securities, at par without any realized losses.\n\n&#160;\n\nNon-Marketable Equity Investment \n\n&#160;\n\nIn November 2020, the Company made an equity investment in a privately held Swiss company (the &#8220;Investee&#8221;) that is accounted for under the measurement alternative. In April 2022, the Company made an investment in a convertible loan that will convert into additional shares of the Investee. One member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors is an executive officer of a company that has a commercial relationship with the Investee. In addition, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer has a personal investment in the Investee and is on the Investee&#8217;s board of directors. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company&#8217;s investment in the Investee, which is denominated in Swiss Franc, had a carrying value of $ 5.4 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively. The Company did not record any impairment or adjustments resulting from observable price changes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n&#160;\n\nRestricted Cash \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; Cash and cash equivalents\n\n&#160; $ 288,607 &#160; &#160; $ 189,265 &#160; Restricted cash included in other long-term assets\n\n&#160; &#160; 122 &#160; &#160; &#160; 124 &#160; Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\n&#160; $ 288,729 &#160; &#160; $ 189,389 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, restricted cash included a security deposit that is set aside in a bank account and cannot be withdrawn by the Company under the terms of a lease agreement.

As of December 31, 2022, the total intrinsic value of all outstanding RSUs was $ 939.5 million, based on the closing stock price of $ 353.61 . As of December 31, 2022, unamortized compensation expense related to all outstanding RSUs was $ 218.8 million with a weighted-average remaining recognition period of approximately two years. \n\n&#160;\n\nCash proceeds from vested PSUs with a purchase price totaled $ 5.4 million, $ 17.3 million and $ 18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nTime-Based RSUs \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Compensation Committee granted 49,000 , 46,000 and 76,000 RSUs, respectively, with service conditions to non-executive employees and non-employee directors. The RSUs generally vest over four years for employees and one year for directors, subject to continued service with the Company.\n\n&#160;\n\nPSUs and MPSUs \n\n&#160;\n\n2022 PSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2022, the Compensation Committee granted 81,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of two sets of performance goals ( &#8220;2022 Executive PSUs&#8221;). For the first goal, the executive officers could earn up to 300 % of the target number of the 2022 Executive PSUs based on the achievement of the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2022 and 2023 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association. 50 % of the 2022 Executive PSUs would vest in the first quarter of 2024 if the pre-determined revenue goal was met during the performance period. The remaining 2022 Executive PSUs would vest over the following two years on a quarterly basis. For the second goal, the executive officers could earn up to an additional 200 % of the target number of the 2022 Executive PSUs if the Company secured additional wafer capacity during a three -year performance period. The 2022 Executive PSUs related to the second goal would fully vest in the first quarter of 2025 if the pre-determined goal was met during the performance period. In addition, all vested shares related to the second goal would be subject to a post-vesting sales restriction period of one year. Assuming the achievement of the highest level of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2022 Executive PSUs would be $ 142.7 million. The 2022 Executive PSUs were subsequently cancelled by the Board of Directors in October 2022. See the &#8220;2022 MSUs&#8221; section for further details.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2022, the Compensation Committee granted 14,000 PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represent a target number of shares that can be earned subject to the achievement of the Company&#8217;s 2023 revenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the achievement of the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2022 and 2023 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association ( &#8220;2022 Non-Executive PSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee can earn is either 200 % or 300 % of the target number of the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs, depending on the job classification of the employee. 50 % of the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs will vest in the first quarter of 2024 if the pre-determined goals are met during the performance period. The remaining 2022 Non-Executive PSUs will vest over the following two years on an annual or quarterly basis. Assuming the achievement of the highest level of performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs is $ 12.6 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe 2022 Executive PSUs and the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs contain a purchase price feature, which requires the employees to pay the Company $ 30 per share upon vesting of the shares. The $30 purchase price requirement is deemed satisfied and waived if the average stock price for 20 consecutive trading days at any time during 2022 and 2023 is $30 higher than the grant date stock price of $ 393.16 . This market condition was achieved in the first quarter of 2022. The Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2022 Executive PSUs for the first goal and the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 393.16 , simulation term of four years, expected volatility of 44.6 %, risk-free interest rate of 1.5 %, and expected dividend yield of 0.8 %. In addition, for the 2022 Executive PSUs related to the second goal, the fair value was determined based on the closing stock price at the end of each reporting period, adjusted for accrued dividends and an illiquidity discount of 10.3 % to account for the post-vesting sales restrictions.\n\n&#160;\n\n2021 PSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2021, the Compensation Committee granted 80,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of two sets of performance goals ( &#8220;2021 Executive PSUs&#8221;). For the first goal, the executive officers could earn up to 300 % of the target number of the 2021 Executive PSUs based on the achievement of the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2021 and 2022 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association. Based on the actual revenue achievement at the end of the performance period, a total of 240,000 shares were awarded to the executive officers. 50 % of the 2021 Executive PSUs will vest in the first quarter of 2023. The remaining 2021 Executive PSUs will vest over the following two years on a quarterly basis. For the second goal, the executive officers could earn an additional 100% of the target number of the 2021 Executive PSUs subject to the achievement of three environmental objectives under the Company&#8217;s ESG initiatives with a performance period through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, one environmental objective was achieved and a total of 20,000 shares were awarded to the executive officers. The 2021 Executive PSUs related to the ESG goal will fully vest upon achievement of the objectives, but no earlier than December 31, 2022. All vested shares related to the ESG goal will be subject to a post-vesting sales restriction period of one year. Assuming the achievement of the highest level of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2021 Executive PSUs is $ 114.4 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2021, the Compensation Committee granted 14,000 PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of the Company&#8217;s 2022 revenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the achievement of the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2021 and 2022 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association ( &#8220;2021 Non-Executive PSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee could earn is either 200 % or 300 % of the target number of the 2021 Non-Executive PSUs, depending on the job classification of the employee. Based on the actual revenue achievement at the end of the performance period, a total of 33,000 shares were awarded to the non-executive employees. 50 % of the 2021 Non-Executive PSUs will vest in the first quarter of 2023. The remaining 2021 Non-Executive PSUs will vest over the following two years on an annual or quarterly basis. Based on the actual achievement of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2021 Non-Executive PSUs is $ 12.2 million.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; The 2021 Executive PSUs and the 2021 Non-Executive PSUs contained a purchase price feature, which required the employees to pay the Company $ 30 per share upon vesting of the shares. The $30 purchase price requirement was deemed satisfied and waived if the average stock price for 20 consecutive trading days at any time between the grant date and December 31, 2022 was $30 higher than the grant date stock price of $ 374.57 . This market condition was achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2021 Executive PSUs and the 2021 Non-Executive PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 374.57 , simulation term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 41.4 %, risk-free interest rate of 0.3 %, and expected dividend yield of 0.6 %. In addition, the grant date fair value for the 2021 Executive PSUs subject to the ESG goal included an illiquidity discount of 9.8 % to account for the post-vesting sales restrictions.\n\n&#160;\n\n2020 PSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2020 , the Compensation Committee granted 100,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned based on the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2020 and 2021 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association ( &#8220;2020 Executive PSUs&#8221;).

Based on the actual revenue achievement at the end of the performance period, a total of 300,000 shares were awarded to the executive officers. 50 % of the 2020 Executive PSUs vested in the first quarter of 2022. The remaining 2020 Executive PSUs vest over the following two years on a quarterly basis. Based on the actual achievement of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2020 Executive PSUs is $ 51.1 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2020 , the Compensation Committee granted 30,000 PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned based on the Company&#8217;s 2021 revenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2020 and 2021 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association ( &#8220;2020 Non-Executive PSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee could earn was either 200 % or 300 % of the target number of the 2020 Non-Executive PSUs, depending on the job classification of the employee. Based on the actual revenue achievement at the end of the performance period, a total of 71,000 shares were awarded to the non-executive employees. 50 % of the 2020 Non-Executive PSUs vested in the first quarter of 2022.

Based on the actual achievement of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2020 Non-Executive PSUs is $ 12.1 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe 2020 Executive PSUs and the 2020 Non-Executive PSUs contained a purchase price feature, which required the employees to pay the Company $ 30 per share upon vesting of the shares. The $30 purchase price requirement was deemed satisfied and waived if the average stock price for 20 consecutive trading days at any time during the performance period was $30 higher than the grant date stock price of $ 182.62 . This market condition was achieved in the second quarter of 2020. The Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2020 Executive PSUs and the 2020 Non-Executive PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 182.62 , simulation term of 2.0 years, expected volatility of 33.6 %, risk-free interest rate of 1.4 %, and expected dividend yield of 1.1 %. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; 2020 &#160; MPSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn July 2020 , the Compensation Committee granted 43,000 MPSUs to the executive officers and 2,000 MPSUs to certain key employees, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned based on the achievement of both market and performance conditions ( &#8220;2020 MPSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee could earn was 500 % of the target number of the 2020 MPSUs. The market conditions consisted of five stock price targets ranging from $ 260 to $ 300 with a performance period through July 20, 2023 , and the performance condition consisted of one business operating goal related to a revenue target for certain customers with a performance period through December 31, 2021 . As of December 31, 2020, the Company has achieved all five price targets and the operating goal, and a total of 221,000 shares were awarded to the employees. 75 % of the 2020 MPSUs will vest on July 20, 2023 and 25 % of the 2020 MPSUs will vest on July 20, 2024 . All vested shares will be subject to a post-vesting sales restriction period of one year. Based on the actual achievement of the market and performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2020 MPSUs is $ 42.1 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2020 MPSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 248.71 , simulation term of 4.0 years, expected volatility of 38.8 %, risk-free interest rate of 0.2 %, and expected dividend yield of 0.8 %. In addition, the grant date fair value included an illiquidity discount of 8.9 % to account for the post-vesting sales restrictions.\n\n&#160;\n\n2019 PSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2019, the Compensation Committee granted 151,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned based on the Company&#8217;s average two -year ( 2019 and 2020 ) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry&#8217;s average two -year revenue growth rate as published by the Semiconductor Industry Association ( &#8220;2019 Executive PSUs&#8221;).

The maximum number of shares that an executive officer can earn is 500 % of the target number of the 2022 Executive MSUs if: ( 1 ) the Company achieves five stock price targets ranging from $ 455 to $ 591 at any time during the performance period, and ( 2 ) the Company&#8217;s total stockholder return ranks in the 50 th percentile or above relative to the Peer Group at the end of the performance period. Upon achievement of the performance conditions, the 2022 Executive MSUs will fully vest on October 25, 2025. Under modification accounting, the total stock-based compensation cost is $ 119.2 million, which includes the unamortized expense of $ 102.8 million related to 2022 Executive PSUs on the modification date and the incremental cost of $ 16.4 million related to the 2022 Executive MSUs as a result of the modification.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2022 Executive MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 342.16 , simulation term of three years, expected volatility of 54.0 %, risk-free interest rate of 4.4 %, and an expected dividend yield of 0.9 %. There is no illiquidity discount because the awards do not contain any post-vesting sales restrictions.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2022, the Compensation Committee granted 24,000 MSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represent a target number of shares that can be earned upon achievement of stock price targets ( &#8220;2022 Non-Executive MSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee can earn is 500 % of the target number of the 2022 Non-Executive MSUs if the Company achieves five stock price targets ranging from $ 472 to $ 590 during a performance period from February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025. Two stock price targets were achieved during the third quarter of 2022. The 2022 Non-Executive MSUs will vest in equal amounts on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of February 3, 2025. The total stock-based compensation cost for the 2022 Non-Executive MSUs is $ 31.3 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2022 Non-Executive MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 393.16 , simulation term of six years, expected volatility of 39.0 %, risk-free interest rate of 1.7 %, and expected dividend yield of 0.8 %.\n\n&#160;\n\n2018 MSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn October 2018, the Compensation Committee granted 60,000 MSUs to the executive officers and 60,000 MSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned upon achievement of stock price targets ( &#8220;2018 MSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee could earn was 500 % of the target number of the 2018 MSUs if the Company achieved five stock price targets ranging from $ 140 to $ 172 during a performance period from October 26, 2018 to December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, all stock price targets have been achieved and the employees were awarded a total of 600,000 shares. The 2018 MSUs will vest on January 1, 2024, with post-vesting sales restrictions on the vested shares for up to an additional two years. The total stock-based compensation cost for the 2018 MSUs is $ 39.1 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2018 MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 108.43 , expected volatility of 31.6 %, a risk-free interest rate of 3.0 %, and an illiquidity discount of 8.7 % to account for the post-vesting sales restrictions. \n\n&#160;\n\n2013 MSUs: \n\n&#160;\n\nIn December 2013, the Compensation Committee granted 276,000 MSUs to the executive officers and 84,000 MSUs to certain non-executive employees, which represented a target number of shares that could be earned upon achievement of stock price targets ( &#8220;2013 MSUs&#8221;). The maximum number of shares that an employee could earn was 500 % of the target number of the 2013 MSUs if the Company achieved five price targets ranging from $ 40 to $ 56 during a performance period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, all stock price targets have been achieved and the employees were awarded a total of 1.8 million shares. The 2013 MSUs vest quarterly from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023. The total stock-based compensation cost for the 2013 MSUs is $ 38.2 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2013 MSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $ 31.73 , expected volatility of 38.7 % and a risk-free interest rate of 1.6 %. There was no illiquidity discount because the awards do not contain any post-vesting sales restrictions.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; ESPP \n\n&#160;\n\nUnder the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions. Participants may not purchase more than 2,000 shares in a six -month offering period, or purchase shares having a value greater than $ 25,000 in any calendar year as measured at the beginning of the offering period in accordance with the IRC and applicable treasury regulations. The ESPP provides for an annual increase by an amount equal to the least of one million shares, 2 % of the outstanding shares of common stock on the first day of the year, or a number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, 4.5 million shares were available for future issuance. The ESPP will expire in November 2024. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 14,000 , 17,000 and 28,000 shares were issued under the ESPP, respectively. The intrinsic value of the shares issued was $ 1.6 million, $ 2.4 million and $ 2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the unamortized expense was $ 0.4 million, which will be recognized through the first quarter of 2023. The Black-Scholes model was used to value the employee stock purchase rights with the following weighted-average assumptions: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; Expected term (in years)\n\n&#160; &#160; 0.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0.5 &#160; Expected volatility\n\n&#160; &#160; 50.6 % &#160; &#160; 43.2 % &#160; &#160; 48.9 % Risk-free interest rate\n\n&#160; &#160; 1.9 % &#160; &#160; 0.1 % &#160; &#160; 0.8 % Dividend yield\n\n&#160; &#160; 0.6 % &#160; &#160; 0.6 % &#160; &#160; 0.9 % ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash proceeds from the shares issued under the ESPP were $ 5.9 million, $ 4.7 million and $ 3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8. DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS \n\n&#160;\n\nCash Dividend Program \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has a dividend program approved by the Board of Directors, pursuant to which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. Based on the Company&#8217;s historical practice, stockholders of record as of the last business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors, which are payable to the stockholders in the following month. The Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends (in thousands, except per-share amounts): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; Dividend declared per share\n\n&#160; $ 3.00 &#160; &#160; $ 2.40 &#160; &#160; $ 2.00 &#160; Total amount\n\n&#160; $ 140,337 &#160; &#160; $ 110,206 &#160; &#160; $ 89,832 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, &#160; 2022 and 2021, accrued dividends totaled $ 35.3 million and $ 27.7 million, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of the Company&#8217;s stockholders.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company anticipates that cash used for future dividend payments will come from its domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, and cash repatriated from its Bermuda subsidiary. The Company also anticipates that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.\n\n&#160;\n\nCash Dividend Equivalent Rights \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s RSUs contain rights to receive cash dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. The dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill the requisite service requirement and, as a result, the awards do not vest. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , accrued dividend equivalents totaled $ 13.8 million and $ 13.1 million, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9.

The realizability of the Company&#8217;s net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has evaluated the realization of its deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the more-likely-than- not recognition threshold. \n\n&#160;\n\nUndistributed Earnings of Subsidiaries: \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has analyzed its global working capital and cash requirements, and has determined that it plans to repatriate cash from its Bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund its future U.S.-based expenditures and dividends. No cash was repatriated from the subsidiary during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company repatriated $ 70.0 million and $ 30.0 million from its Bermuda subsidiary, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor all other foreign subsidiaries, the Company expects to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings to fund their operations and R&#38;D. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the undistributed earnings were approximately $ 67.4 million and $ 46.2 million, respectively. An actual repatriation of the undistributed earnings could be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. The Company expects to be able to take a dividend received deduction to offset any U.S. federal income tax liability on the undistributed earnings. Determination of the unrecognized state and withholding deferred tax liability is not practicable at this time due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Income Tax Provision Matters \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have federal net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2022, the state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $ 6.0 million, which will expire beginning in 2028. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of $ 67.2 million, which will expire beginning in 2029. &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had no R&#38;D tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes, and $ 36.7 million for state income tax purposes, which can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn the event of a change in ownership, as defined under federal and state tax laws, the Company's net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be subject to annual limitations.&#8239;The annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards prior to utilization.\n\n&#160;&#8239;\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 49.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $ 38.3 million of which would affect its effective tax rate if recognized after considering the valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 41.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $ 31.5 million of which would affect its effective tax rate if recognized after considering the valuation allowance. \n\n&#160;\n\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Balance as of January 1, 2020\n\n&#160; $ 25,407 &#160; Increase for tax position of current year\n\n&#160; &#160; 9,782 &#160; Decrease for tax position of prior year\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 907 ) Decrease due to settlement with tax authorities\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 560 ) Decrease due to lapse of statute of limitation\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 223 ) Balance as of December 31, 2020\n\n&#160; &#160; 33,499 &#160; Increase for tax position of current year\n\n&#160; &#160; 9,191 &#160; Decrease for tax position of prior year\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 657 ) Decrease due to settlement with tax authorities\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 54 ) Decrease due to lapse of statute of limitation\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 458 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021\n\n&#160; &#160; 41,521 &#160; Increase for tax position of current year\n\n&#160; &#160; 10,965 &#160; Increase for tax position of prior year\n\n&#160; &#160; 247 &#160; Decrease due to settlement with tax authorities\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 970 ) Decrease due to lapse of statute of limitation\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 2,486 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022\n\n&#160; $ 49,277 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has $ 4.3 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively, of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions, which were recorded in long-term income tax liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n&#160;&#8239;\n\nUncertain tax positions relate to the allocation of income and deductions among the Company&#8217;s global entities and to the determination of the R&#38;D tax credit. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, it is not possible to determine either the magnitude or the range of increases or decreases at this time.\n\n&#160;&#8239;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company currently has reduced tax rates in its subsidiaries in Chengdu and Hangzhou, China through 2023 and 2030, respectively, for performing R&#38;D activities.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn August 9, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act to provide certain financial and tax incentives to the semiconductor industry, primarily for manufacturing activities within the United States. On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted and signed into law. The IRA, among other things, introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax, based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, and imposes a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases. This excise tax is effective January 1, 2023. The Company does not believe the CHIPS Act or the IRA had a material impact on its income tax provisions, results of operations or financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Tax Examination \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is subject to examination of its income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. In general, the tax years for 2007 and forward are open for examination for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\n\n&#160;\n\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\n&#160;\n\nWarranty and Indemnification Provisions \n\n&#160;\n\nThe changes in warranty reserves are as follows (in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; Balance at beginning of period\n\n&#160; $ 20,989 &#160; &#160; $ 6,895 &#160; &#160; $ 1,139 &#160; Warranty issued\n\n&#160; &#160; 3,092 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,558 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,395 &#160; Repairs, replacement and refund\n\n&#160; &#160; ( 2,357 ) &#160; &#160; ( 1,770 ) &#160; &#160; ( 843 ) Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations\n\n&#160; &#160; 2,358 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,306 &#160; &#160; &#160; 204 &#160; Balance at end of period\n\n&#160; $ 24,082 &#160; &#160; $ 20,989 &#160; &#160; $ 6,895 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company provides indemnification agreements to certain direct or indirect customers. The Company agrees to reimburse these parties for any damages, costs and expenses incurred by them as a result of legal actions taken against them by third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights as a result of using the Company&#8217;s products and technologies. These indemnification provisions are varied in their scope and are subject to certain terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers.\n\n&#160;\n\nIt is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the limited history of indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. There were no indemnification liabilities incurred for the periods presented. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.\n\n&#160;\n\nPurchase Commitments \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has outstanding purchase obligations with its suppliers and other parties that require the purchases of goods or services, which primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction of manufacturing and R&#38;D facilities, purchases of production and other equipment, and license arrangements.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn May 2022, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement in order to secure manufacturing production capacity for silicon wafers over a four -year period. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had made prepayments under this agreement of $ 170.0 million, which were reported in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal estimated future unconditional purchase commitments to all suppliers and other parties as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 2023\n\n&#160; $ 455,383 &#160; 2024\n\n&#160; &#160; 291,528 &#160; 2025\n\n&#160; &#160; 349,765 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 1,096,676 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nLitigation \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including challenges to the enforceability or validity of its intellectual property, claims that the Company&#8217;s products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. The Company may also be subject to litigation initiated by its stockholders. These proceedings often involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims. As of December 31, 2022 , there were no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company was a party.\n\n&#160;\n\n13. EMPLOYEE 401 (k) PLAN \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company sponsors a 401 (k) retirement savings plan for all employees in the U.S. who meet certain eligibility requirements. Participants may contribute up to the amount allowable as a deduction for federal income tax purposes. The Company is not required to contribute and did not contribute to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n14. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company sells its products primarily through third -party distributors and value-added resellers, and directly to OEMs, ODMs and EMS providers. The following table summarizes those customers with sales equal to 10% or more of the Company's total revenue: \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; Customer \n\n&#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; Distributor A\n\n&#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; 26 % &#160; 24 % Distributor B\n\n&#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; 15 % &#160; 11 % Distributor C\n\n&#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; * &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n* Represents less than 10%. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s agreements with these third -party customers were made in the ordinary course of business and may be terminated with or without cause by these customers with advance notice. Although the Company may experience a short-term disruption in the distribution of its products and a short-term decline in revenue if its agreement with any of the distributors was terminated, the Company believes that such termination would not have a material adverse effect on its financial statements because it would be able to engage alternative distributors, resellers and other distribution channels to deliver its products to end customers within a short period following the termination of the agreement with the distributor.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes those customers with accounts receivable equal to 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s total accounts receivable: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; December 31, \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; Distributor A\n\n&#160; &#160; 29 % &#160; &#160; 26 % Distributor B\n\n&#160; &#160; 23 % &#160; &#160; 17 % Value-added reseller A\n\n&#160; &#160; * &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n* Represents less than 10%. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n15. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company operates in one reportable segment that includes the design, development, marketing and sale of high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic solutions for the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. The Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company derives a majority of its revenue from sales to customers located outside North America, with geographic revenue based on the customers&#8217; ship-to locations. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following is a summary of revenue by geographic regions (in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; Country or Region \n\n&#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; China\n\n&#160; $ 938,946 &#160; &#160; $ 700,985 &#160; &#160; $ 516,519 &#160; Taiwan\n\n&#160; &#160; 233,040 &#160; &#160; &#160; 169,130 &#160; &#160; &#160; 109,256 &#160; Europe\n\n&#160; &#160; 145,584 &#160; &#160; &#160; 85,201 &#160; &#160; &#160; 56,329 &#160; South Korea\n\n&#160; &#160; 189,478 &#160; &#160; &#160; 93,027 &#160; &#160; &#160; 64,093 &#160; Southeast Asia\n\n&#160; &#160; 95,739 &#160; &#160; &#160; 54,611 &#160; &#160; &#160; 42,403 &#160; Japan\n\n&#160; &#160; 91,048 &#160; &#160; &#160; 68,720 &#160; &#160; &#160; 35,461 &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; 99,804 &#160; &#160; &#160; 35,770 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20,098 &#160; Other\n\n&#160; &#160; 509 &#160; &#160; &#160; 354 &#160; &#160; &#160; 293 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 1,794,148 &#160; &#160; $ 1,207,798 &#160; &#160; $ 844,452 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nThe following is a summary of revenue by major product families (in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; Product Family \n\n&#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; DC to DC\n\n&#160; $ 1,696,594 &#160; &#160; $ 1,147,329 &#160; &#160; $ 800,478 &#160; Lighting Control\n\n&#160; &#160; 97,554 &#160; &#160; &#160; 60,469 &#160; &#160; &#160; 43,974 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 1,794,148 &#160; &#160; $ 1,207,798 &#160; &#160; $ 844,452 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following is a summary of long-lived assets by geographic regions (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; December 31, \n\n&#160; Country \n\n&#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2021 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2020 \n\n&#160; China\n\n&#160; $ 200,508 &#160; &#160; $ 211,973 &#160; &#160; $ 151,752 &#160; United States\n\n&#160; &#160; 113,996 &#160; &#160; &#160; 113,805 &#160; &#160; &#160; 101,768 &#160; Taiwan\n\n&#160; &#160; 20,074 &#160; &#160; &#160; 19,607 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18,797 &#160; Other\n\n&#160; &#160; 22,579 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17,577 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,211 &#160; Total\n\n&#160; $ 357,157 &#160; &#160; $ 362,962 &#160; &#160; $ 281,528 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16.
