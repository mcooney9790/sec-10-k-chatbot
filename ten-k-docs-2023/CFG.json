      "text": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. We offer a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies, large corporations and institutions. Our products and services are offered through more than 1,100 branches in 14 states and the District of Columbia and 123 retail and commercial non-branch offices, though certain lines of business serve national markets. At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of $226.7 billion, total deposits of $180.7 billion and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $23.7 billion. \n\nWe are a BHC incorporated under Delaware state law in 1984 and our primary federal regulator is the FRB. CBNA is our banking subsidiary, whose primary federal regulator is the OCC. \n\nBusiness Segments \n\nWe manage our business through two business segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. For additional information regarding our business segments see the &#8220;Business Operating Segments&#8221; section of Item 7 and Note 26 in Item 8. Our activities outside these segments are classified as &#8220;Other&#8221; and include treasury activities, wholesale funding activities, the securities portfolio, community development assets, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses, including income tax expense. \n\nConsumer Banking Segment \n\nConsumer Banking serves retail customers and small businesses with annual revenues of up to $25 million, with products and services that include deposit products, mortgage and home equity lending, credit cards, business loans, wealth management and investment services largely across our 14-state traditional banking footprint. We also offer auto, education and point-of-sale finance loans in addition to select digital deposit products nationwide. \n\nConsumer Banking operates a multi-channel distribution network with a workforce of approximately 5,780 branch colleagues, approximately 1,100 branches, including 220 in-store locations, and approximately 3,400 ATMs. Our network includes approximately 1,250 specialists covering lending, savings and investment needs as well as a broad range of small business products and services. We serve customers on a national basis through telephone service centers as well as through our online and mobile platforms where we offer customers the convenience of depositing funds, paying bills and transferring money between accounts and from person to person, as well as a host of other everyday transactions. \n\nCommercial Banking Segment \n\nCommercial Banking primarily serves companies and institutions with annual revenues of over $25 million to more than $3.0 billion and strives to be our clients&#8217; trusted advisor and preferred provider for their banking needs. We offer a broad complement of financial products and solutions, including lending and leasing, deposit and treasury management services, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risk management solutions, as well as syndicated loans, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, and debt and equity capital markets capabilities. \n\nCommercial Banking is structured along business lines and product groups. The business lines, Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate, and the product groups, Corporate Finance &#38; Capital Markets, and Treasury Solutions work in teams to understand client needs and provide comprehensive solutions to meet those needs. We acquire new clients through a coordinated approach to the market, leveraging deep industry knowledge in specialized banking groups and a geographic coverage model. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 6 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCorporate Banking serves middle market commercial and industrial clients with annual gross revenues of $25 million to $500 million, and mid-corporate clients with annual revenues of $500 million to more than $3.0 billion in the United States. In several areas, such as Aerospace, Defense and Government Services, Communications, Transportation and Logistics, Franchise, Human Capital Management, and Gaming we offer a more dedicated and tailored approach to better meet the unique needs of these client segments. \n\nCommercial Real Estate provides customized debt capital solutions for middle market operators, institutional developers, investors, and REITs. Commercial Real Estate provides financing for projects primarily in the multi-family, co-op, office, industrial, retail, healthcare and hospitality sectors. \n\nCorporate Finance &#38; Capital Markets serves clients through key product groups including Corporate Finance, Capital Markets, and Global Markets. Corporate Finance provides advisory services to middle market and mid-corporate clients, including mergers and acquisitions and capital structure advice. The team works closely with industry-sector specialists within capital markets to advise our clients. Corporate Finance also provides acquisition and follow-on financing for new and recapitalized portfolio companies of key sponsors, with services meeting the unique and time-sensitive needs of private equity firms, management companies and funds, and underwriting and portfolio management expertise for leveraged transactions and relationships. Capital Markets originates, structures and underwrites credit and equity facilities targeting middle market, mid-corporate and private equity sponsors. They focus on offering value-added ideas to optimize their capital structures, including advising on and facilitating mergers and acquisitions, valuations, tender offers, financial restructurings, bond and equity underwriting, asset sales, divestitures and other corporate reorganizations and business combinations. Capital Markets also provides sales and trading across loan, fixed income and equity products, as well as other brokerage services including equity research. Global Markets provides foreign exchange, interest rate and commodities risk management services. \n\nThe Treasury Solutions product group supports Commercial Banking and certain small business clients with treasury management solutions, including domestic and international products and services related to receivables, payables, information reporting and liquidity management, as well as commercial credit cards and trade finance. \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\nOur mission is to help our customers, colleagues and communities reach their potential, and our vision is to become a top-performing bank distinguished by our customer-centric culture, mindset of continuous improvement, and excellent capabilities. We strive to understand customer and client needs, so we can tailor advice and solutions to help make them more successful. Our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our businesses, drive sustainable growth and enhance profitability. Our success rests on our ability to distinguish ourselves as follows: \n\nMaintain a high-performing, customer-centric organization: We continually strive to enhance our &#8220;customer-first&#8221; culture by emphasizing the &#8220;voice of the customer&#8221; to deliver the best possible banking experience. In addition, we are taking talent management to the next level, with a goal of attracting, developing and retaining great people, while ensuring strong leadership, teamwork, and a sense of empowerment, accountability and urgency. \n\nDevelop differentiated value propositions to acquire, deepen, and retain core customer segments: Our focus is on select customer segments where we believe we are well positioned to compete. In Consumer Banking, we focus on serving mass affluent and affluent customers, and small businesses customers nationally. In Commercial Banking, we focus on serving customers in the middle market, mid-corporate, and select industry verticals. By developing differentiated and targeted value propositions, building our fee-based businesses and developing innovative solutions, we believe we can attract new customers, deepen relationships with existing customers and deliver an enhanced customer experience. We are integrating recent transactions in the NYC Metro market area and are improving the productivity of those acquired branches and deepening relationships with those customers. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 7 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBuild excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from competitors: We strive to deliver seamless, multi-channel experiences that allow customers to interact with us when, where and how they choose. We are enhancing capabilities in key areas including consumer lending, wealth, capital markets and payments. We are on a multi-year digital transformation journey across our Consumer and Commercial organizations to digitize end-to-end customer experiences and transform our marketing to drive consumer-direct acquisition in order to satisfy rapidly changing customer preferences. We are accelerating the use of advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence for personalization and to provide timely, insight-driven, tailored advice in order to deliver solutions to consumer and business customers throughout their lifecycles. \n\nOperate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to self-fund investments: We believe that continued focus on operational efficiency is critical to our future profitability and ability to continue to reinvest to drive future growth. We launched the first Tapping our Potential (&#8220;TOP&#8221;) initiative in 2014 and have launched additional programs in subsequent years. These programs are designed to transform how we operate and to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and competitiveness of our franchise. Our TOP 7 program was completed in 2022, and we are launching a TOP 8 program to allow us to continue to self-fund investments. \n\nPrudently grow and optimize our balance sheet: We operate with a strong balance sheet with regard to capital and liquidity, coupled with a well-defined and prudent risk appetite. We continue to focus on thoughtfully growing our balance sheet by actively managing capital and resource allocations towards relationships-oriented growth to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our goal is to be good stewards of our resources and continue to rigorously evaluate our execution. \n\nModernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery, organizational agility and speed to market: We are continuing to modernize our technology environment by strengthening our infrastructure and migrating applications to the cloud. We have deployed and scaled an agile operating model to improve our speed-to-market, deliver innovative products and services and strengthen collaboration across teams. We will also continue to actively incubate new innovative ideas and harness external innovation through FinTech partnerships to help deliver differentiated value-added experiences for our customers. \n\nEmbed risk management within our culture and operations: Given that the quality of our risk management program directly affects our ability to execute our strategy, we continue to work to further strengthen our risk management culture. Moreover, we are committed to continuously enhancing our processes and talent, and to making improvements in the platform including ongoing investments in risk technology and frameworks. These actions are designed to support and enhance our risk management capabilities and regulatory profile. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. Our branch footprint is predominantly in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, though certain lines of business serve national markets. Within these markets we face competition from community banks, super-regional and national financial institutions, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products, pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The ability of non-banking financial institutions, including FinTech companies, to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition. \n\nIn Consumer Banking, the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone, online and mobile channels. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services. The emergence of digital-only banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Given their lower cost structure, these models are often, on average, able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint. The primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates, fees charged, tailored value propositions to different customer segments, customer service levels, convenience, including branch locations and hours of operation, and the range of products and services offered. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 8 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn Commercial Banking, there is competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions, particularly large regional banks, as well as commercial finance companies, leasing companies, other non-bank lenders, and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation managers, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some larger competitors, including certain national banks that compete in our market area, may offer a broader array of products and, due to their asset size, may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their balance sheet. We compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions, quality of customer service and execution, range of products offered, price and reputation. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nWe believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a high-performing workforce. Our goal is to create an environment where colleagues can thrive personally and professionally and can maximize their potential. As of December 31, 2022, Citizens and its subsidiaries had 18,889 full-time equivalent employees, primarily across New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Our Board of Directors and the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are responsible for overseeing our human capital management strategy, with senior management providing regular updates to facilitate that oversight. \n\nLeadership, Talent Development, and Talent Acquisition and Mobility \n\nOur leaders are the catalysts to achieve the culture we want to foster. During 2022, we conducted a detailed assessment of the current state of our culture and leadership to inform future areas of focus. As we continue to prepare colleagues for the future, we are building capabilities by upskilling and reskilling colleagues to support new ways of working and operating models. We offer programs that include technical and skills-based programs as well as resources aligned with our leadership competencies. To deepen critical skills, we have expanded our learning academies focusing on Innovation, Agile, Next Gen Tech, Banking and Credit, and Data &#38; Analytics. Through our development programs, we aim to equip colleagues with the skills necessary to excel in their current roles and to build competencies that will enable them to be highly valuable contributors in the future. Our culture is one of continuous learning, which we believe is crucial for colleagues to thrive as part of our organization and to feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose. \n\nWe continue to expand recruiting efforts across the different levels of the organization, with the goal of building a strong pipeline of future leaders. This includes strengthening opportunities for internal mobility within Citizens through rotational programs and our academies, as well as external partnerships to support our ability to hire critical talent in areas such as technology, digital, cyber, marketing and data. \n\nEmployee Engagement \n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to develop a high performing workforce and make Citizens a great place to work and build a career, we have used McKinsey &#38; Company&#8217;s Organizational Health Index (&#8220;OHI&#8221;) since our 2014 initial public offering to understand colleagues&#8217; viewpoints about Citizens on a range of topics. OHI results are used to refine our focus, address gaps, and strengthen efforts to improve our organizational effectiveness and colleague experience. Since our inaugural survey, our overall OHI score has increased nearly 20 points to 77 in 2022 and is now within the first quartile of McKinsey&#8217;s global benchmarks. The results of our OHI surveys have been instrumental in helping management prioritize areas of change that are most important to colleagues. In 2023, we are transitioning to a new listening platform, which will include a colleague survey tool aimed at providing additional insights as we continue to evolve our strategy and culture. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nWe foster a culture where all stakeholders feel respected, valued, and heard. Our DE&#38;I strategy is focused on creating an environment of inclusion and belonging, building a more diverse workforce and evaluating the effectiveness of our initiatives. \n\nWe are committed to increasing the representation of women and people of color, particularly in leadership roles. To that end, we have continued to develop strong partnerships with business and community organizations to help identify qualified diverse candidates for roles within every segment of our organization. In addition, through our diverse hiring commitment, we aim to have at least 50% of candidates interviewed for mid-to-senior openings be women or people of color. Internal diversity scorecards are used to measure our progress across multiple DE&#38;I metrics. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 58% of our colleagues were women and approximately 32% were people of color. In addition, approximately 31% of the members of our Board of Directors are women and approximately 15% are people of color. More detail regarding our workforce demographics can be found on our website and in our Corporate Responsibility Report. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 9 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDevelopment programs are designed to build a strong pipeline of diverse emerging talent internally. Development efforts have been effective in increasing the number of women and people of color considered &#8220;ready now&#8221; succession candidates. We also partner with external organizations to offer additional resources for reskilling and upskilling diverse colleagues. We also offer education programs focused on embedding inclusive behaviors in our culture to all colleagues. We require all colleagues to attend inclusion training and there is additional targeted inclusion training specifically for colleagues in manager roles. \n\nWe use various resources to understand what drives a sense of inclusion and belonging and to identify what actions will be effective in attracting and retaining diverse colleagues. Analytics are used to help prioritize initiatives, including answers to OHI survey items, which we segment by various colleague populations to provide additional insights. In addition, we have seven business resource groups (&#8220;BRGs&#8221;), which are an extension of the business and are integral to identifying and formulating solutions to DE&#38;I issues that are most important to customers, colleagues, and the community. Citizens BRGs include Citizens WIN (Women&#8217;s Impact Network), Citizens Elev8 (Rising Professionals), Prism (Multicultural), Citizens Pride (LGBTQ+), Citizens Veterans, and Citizens Awake (Disability Awareness). In 2023, we launched an additional BRG, Caring for Citizens (Caregivers). Each BRG is sponsored by a member of the executive team and, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 3,200 colleagues belonged to at least one BRG. \n\nHealth, Well-Being, and Workplace Flexibility \n\nWe prioritize the health and well-being of our colleagues and their loved ones. Our benefit programs are designed to support colleagues&#8217; physical, mental, and financial well-being and we have added several resources in recent years, including additional mental and emotional health resources and emergency back-up child and adult care. We also recently enhanced our Parental Leave Policy to six weeks of paid time off for all permanent colleagues who become parents; birth mothers are eligible for an additional 10 weeks, for a total of 16 weeks. We added an ESG fund to our 401(k) plan investment options and there were no increases to colleague premiums, co-pays or deductibles for medical, dental, and vision coverage for 2023 in recognition of the impact of inflation on colleagues. \n\nWe implemented a return to office strategy which incorporates flexibility for colleagues. As part of that strategy, non-branch roles have been assigned to various categories including fully remote, hybrid, or fully in the office, based on the responsibilities of each role. This approach has allowed us to balance colleague flexibility with in-person collaboration, which we believe is key to maintaining our Company values and culture. \n\nFair and Equitable Compensation \n\nWe strive to compensate our colleagues fairly based on market data, experience, and performance, and we compare our compensation to other companies in our peer group as well as others in the financial services industry. \n\nPart of our commitment to building and fostering a diverse, inclusive, high-performing culture includes ensuring our compensation and benefits are fair and competitive for all colleagues. We engage an independent third-party expert firm to conduct an annual pay equity analysis, accounting for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as performance and experience. Additional information about this analysis, including our most recent results, can be found on our website and in our Corporate Responsibility Report. \n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance \n\nInvestors have begun to consider how corporations are addressing ESG matters when making investment decisions. Specifically, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of a company&#8217;s response to climate change as part of their investment strategy. \n\nIn 2021, we announced targets to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2035, based on our 2016 baseline. These reductions align with the recommendations of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit average global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 10 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022, we published our fifth annual Corporate Responsibility Report and completed the CDP&#8217;s Climate Change Questionnaire for the seventh time. We also issued our inaugural Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (&#8220;TCFD&#8221;) report and expanded our climate commitment by: \n\n&#8226; joining the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (&#8220;PCAF&#8221;), a collaboration among worldwide financial institutions working to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions associated with loans and investments; \n\n&#8226; participating in the Risk Management Association Climate Risk Consortium, a financial industry group dedicated to advancing best practices in climate risk management; and \n\n&#8226; entering into a virtual power purchase agreement with &#216;rsted, supporting the construction of the Sunflower Wind Project in Kansas, which will offset 100% of our power consumption across our entire operational footprint with renewable energy credits. \n\nFor more details regarding ESG and other corporate responsibility matters, go to our website. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination under federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, deposit insurance, customer privacy and cybersecurity, capital adequacy and planning, liquidity, safety and soundness, consumer protection and disclosure, permissible activities and investments, and certain transactions with affiliates. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors. The discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to examinations by federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC, FINRA and various state insurance and securities regulators. In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries. As part of our regular examination process, regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. We have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level, including from banking, securities and insurance regulators, state attorneys general, federal agencies or law enforcement authorities, and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. For a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business, see Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; For additional information regarding regulatory matters, see Note 25 in Item 8. \n\nOverview \n\nWe are a BHC under the Bank Holding Company Act. We have elected to be treated as a FHC under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act as effected by GLBA. As such, we are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the FRB, including through the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Under the system of &#8220;functional regulation&#8221; established under the Bank Holding Company Act, the FRB serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization. The OCC serves as the primary regulator for CBNA and the SEC serves as the primary regulator of our broker-dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries, with each supervisory agency directly regulating the activities of those subsidiaries, and the FRB exercising a supervisory role. \n\nThe federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. These banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Federal law governs the activities in which CBNA engages, including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations. The actions the FRB takes to implement monetary policy also affect us. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 11 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn addition, CBNA is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions, such as CBNA, with more than $10 billion in total assets. The CFPB may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. \n\nTailoring of Prudential Requirements \n\nThe FRB and the other federal banking regulators have enacted rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to BHCs and depository institutions to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act (&#8220;Tailoring Rules&#8221;). Under the Tailoring Rules, we are subject to &#8220;Category IV standards,&#8221; which apply to banking organizations with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for Categories I through III. \n\nWe discuss other elements of the Tailoring Rules where relevant below. The liquidity requirements are described below under &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Requirements,&#8221; and the stress testing requirements are described below under &#8220;&#8212;Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements.&#8221; \n\n&#160; Bank and Financial Holding Company Regulation \n\nAs a FHC, we may engage in a broader range of activities than a BHC that is not also a FHC. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the FRB, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to be &#8220;financial in nature or incidental thereto&#8221; or that the FRB determines unilaterally to be &#8220;complementary&#8221; to financial activities. In addition, a FHC may commence new permissible financial activities or acquire non-bank financial companies engaged in such activities, in either case, with after-the-fact notice to the FRB. \n\nTo maintain our FHC status, a BHC (and all of its depository institution subsidiaries), must remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; as described below under &#8220;Federal Deposit Insurance Act&#8221;. If a BHC fails to meet these regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for FHCs or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the BHC or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order the BHC to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for FHCs that are not permissible for BHCs, or the BHC could elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a BHC that is not also a FHC. In addition, the CRA requires U.S. banks to help serve the needs of their communities. If a depository institution subsidiary of a BHC were to receive a CRA rating of less than &#8220;satisfactory&#8221;, the BHC would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities or acquisitions (see &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; below). \n\nFederal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or BHCs. As noted above, FRB approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior regulatory approval is required, however, before we may acquire or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC (including a FHC) or a bank. In considering applications for approval of acquisitions, the banking regulators may take several factors into account, including the competitive effects of the transaction in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of companies involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S. banking or financial system; the companies&#8217; compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs to the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction. \n\nCapital \n\nThe U.S. Basel III rules apply to us. These rules establish risk-based and leverage capital requirements. The risk-based requirements are based on a banking organization&#8217;s risk-weighted assets, also known as RWA, which reflect the organization&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet exposures, subject to risk weights. The leverage requirements are based on a banking organization&#8217;s average consolidated on-balance sheet assets. For more detail on our regulatory capital, see the &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; section of Item 7. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 12 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe calculate RWA using the standardized approach and have made the one-time election to opt-out of recognizing in regulatory capital the impacts of net unrealized gains and losses included within AOCI for debt securities that are available for sale or held to maturity, accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets. \n\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL accounting standard. In reaction to the COVID disruption, on September 30, 2020, the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of the ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. The three-year transition period will phase-in the reversal of the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. \n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, the minimum capital ratios are: \n\n&#8226; 4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets; \n\n&#8226; 6.0% tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; \n\n&#8226; 8.0% total capital (that is, tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and \n\n&#8226; 4.0% tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). \n\nFor BHCs with $100 billion or more in assets, such as us, the FRB&#8217;s capital rules impose a dynamic institution-specific SCB on top of each of the three minimum risk-weighted capital ratios listed above. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios including the SCB will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution&#8217;s &#8220;eligible retained income&#8221;, defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income, or the average four quarter trailing net income. \n\nAs a Category IV firm, our SCB is re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. On August 4, 2022, the FRB announced, based on the results of the 2022 CCAR supervisory stress tests, that our SCB will remain at 3.4% through September 30, 2023. To incorporate the effects of the Investors acquisition on our capital requirements, the FRB will require that we participate in the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test. For more details, see &#8220;&#8212;Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements&#8221; below and the &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; section of Item 7. \n\nWe are also subject to the FRB's risk-based capital requirements for market risk. See the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section of Item 7. \n\n&#160; Liquidity Requirements \n\nThe federal banking regulators have adopted the Basel III-based U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio rule, which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, including us, are not subject to any Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement. \n\nThe Basel III framework also includes a second liquidity standard, the NSFR, which is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon. In October 2020, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations. Under the final rule, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, including us, are not subject to the NSFR requirement. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 13 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFinally, per the liquidity rules included in the FRB&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days. Under the Tailoring Rules, the liquidity buffer requirements continue to apply to Category IV firms, such as us, and we remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements. However, these requirements are now tailored such that we are required to: \n\n&#8226; calculate collateral positions monthly, as opposed to weekly; \n\n&#8226; establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required; and \n\n&#8226; monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than were previously monitored. \n\nWe are also now subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly, rather than monthly, and are required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis. \n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements \n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, such as us, are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB continues to supervise Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. We remain subject to the requirement to develop, maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors, or one of its committees, as well as FR Y-14 reporting requirements. \n\nRegulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, and stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses. \n\nFor more detail on our capital planning and stress testing requirements see the &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; section of Item 7. \n\nResolution Planning \n\nCategory IV firms are no longer required to submit resolution plans to the FRB and FDIC. However, CBNA is required to file periodically a separate resolution plan with the FDIC that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the FDIA in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution&#8217;s failure, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institution&#8217;s creditors. In June 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans for Insured Depository Institutions that, among other things, established a three-year filing cycle for banks with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as CBNA, and provides details regarding the content of the resolution plans that filers are required to prepare. CBNA submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC on December 1, 2022. \n\nStandards for Safety and Soundness \n\nThe FDIA requires the FRB, OCC and FDIC to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions, including CBNA. The agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard, it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. If, after being notified to submit a compliance plan, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the FDIA. See &#8220;Federal Deposit Insurance Act&#8221; below. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 14 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act \n\nThe FDIA requires, among other things, that the federal banking regulators take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements, as described above in &#8220;Capital.&#8221; The FDIA sets forth the following five capital categories: &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A depository institution&#8217;s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. The federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution&#8217;s capital category. Under existing rules, an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution, such as CBNA, is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. \n\nThe FDIA&#8217;s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to BHCs. The FRB&#8217;s regulations applicable to BHCs separately define &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; for BHCs, such as the Parent Company, to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% and a total capital ratio of at least 10%. As described above under &#8220;&#8212;Bank and Financial Holding Company Regulation&#8221;, a FHC that is not well-capitalized and well-managed (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed) under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose FHC status. As of December 31, 2022, both the Parent Company and CBNA were well-capitalized. \n\nThe FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank&#8217;s normal market area or nationally, depending upon where the deposits are solicited, unless it is &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; or it is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. The FDIA imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; \n\nDeposit Insurance \n\nThe FDIA requires CBNA to pay deposit insurance assessments. FDIC assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards: one for most large institutions that have more than $10 billion in assets, such as CBNA, and another for &#8220;highly complex&#8221; institutions that have over $50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that are combined to produce a total score, which is translated into an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC utilizes the CAMELS ratings and forward-looking financial measures to assess an institution&#8217;s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC may make discretionary adjustments to the total score, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply increasing scale. \n\nThe deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. Deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the DIF. The FDIA established a minimum DIF reserve ratio of 1.15% prior to September 2020 and 1.35% thereafter. As of September 30, 2022, the reserve ratio of the DIF was 1.26%. \n\nOn October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that will increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. The increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. \n\nDividends \n\nVarious federal statutory provisions and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 15 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the FRB. In particular, the FRB reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large BHC based on capital plans submitted as part of the CCAR process and on the results of stress tests, as discussed above. In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, is subject to the prior approval of the FRB if we are required to resubmit our capital plan. See &#8220;&#8212;Capital&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements&#8221; above. \n\nDividends payable by CBNA, as a national bank subsidiary, are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a &#8220;recent earnings&#8221; test and an &#8220;undivided profits&#8221; test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year&#8217;s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity&#8217;s &#8220;undivided profits&#8221; (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings. \n\nSupport of Subsidiary Bank \n\nUnder Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which codifies the FRB&#8217;s long-standing &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine, the Parent Company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary. The statute defines &#8220;source of financial strength&#8221; as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution. The FRB may require that the Parent Company provide such support at times even when the Parent Company may not have the financial resources to do so, or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors. In addition, any capital loans by a BHC to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a BHC&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. \n\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders \n\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related FRB rules, including Regulation W, restrict CBNA from extending credit to, or engaging in certain other transactions with, the Parent Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. These restrictions place limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates, which must be limited to 10% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100% to 130%. Covered transactions are defined to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. All covered transactions, including certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest), must be conducted on market terms. The FRB enforces these restrictions, and we are audited for compliance. \n\nSection 23B prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits. The FRB also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates. \n\nPursuant to FRB Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations, must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 16 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nVolcker Rule \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as certain hedge funds or private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; In 2019, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, SEC and CFTC (collectively, the &#8220;Volcker Agencies&#8221;) finalized amendments to their regulations to tailor the Volcker Rule&#8217;s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm&#8217;s trading activity, revise the definition of trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and modify the information companies are required to provide the Volcker Agencies. Under those amendments, we are viewed as having &#8220;moderate&#8221; trading assets and liabilities, and therefore subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that is appropriate for our activities, size, scope, and complexity. In June 2020, the Volcker Agencies finalized other regulations modifying the Volcker Rule&#8217;s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds (referred to under the rule as covered funds). We do not expect either of these regulatory amendments to the Volcker Rule to have a material impact on Citizens. \n\nConsumer Financial Protection Regulations \n\nThe retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts. \n\nIn addition to these federal laws and regulations, the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations. \n\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level, and in certain circumstances allows state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nProtection of Customer Personal Information and Cybersecurity \n\nThe privacy provisions of GLBA generally prohibit financial institutions, including us, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, issued by the FRB, govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies. \n\nThe federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers&#8217; accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. Further, a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. For a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity, see Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 17 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nIn November 2021, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule mandating financial institutions to report certain significant cybersecurity incidents to regulators. The final rule requires a financial institution to notify its primary banking regulator within 36 hours of certain significant cybersecurity incidents which has or is reasonably likely to disrupt or degrade its: \n\n&#8226; ability to carry out banking operations, activities, or processes, or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base; \n\n&#8226; business lines, including associated operations, services, functions, and support, that upon failure would result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value; or \n\n&#8226; operations, including associated services, functions, and support, the failure or discontinuance of which would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. \n\nBank service providers are required to notify at least one designated point of contact at affected banking organization customers as soon as possible after any computer-security incident which has or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade covered services for four or more hours. The final rule was effective April 1, 2022, with a compliance date of May 1, 2022. In addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules that would require reporting on Form 8-K of material cybersecurity incidents. \n\nState regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives new rights to California residents to require certain businesses to disclose or delete their personal information. In addition, many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate. \n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act \n\nThe CRA requires banking regulators to evaluate the Parent Company and CBNA in meeting the credit needs of our local communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate- income neighborhoods. The CRA also requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its examination of a depository institution, to assess such institution&#8217;s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings. The regulatory agency&#8217;s evaluation of the institution&#8217;s record and ratings are made public. These CRA performance evaluations are also considered by regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility, and, in the case of a BHC that has elected FHC status, a CRA rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities. CBNA received a rating of &#8220;outstanding&#8221; in our most recent CRA evaluation. \n\nOn May 5, 2022, the FRB, OCC and FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing revisions to the agencies&#8217; CRA regulations, including with respect to the delineation of assessment areas, the overall evaluation framework and performance standards and metrics, the definition of community development activities, and data collection and reporting. The proposed rule would adjust CRA evaluations based on bank size and type, with many of the proposed changes applying only to banks with over $2 billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over $10 billion in assets, such as CBNA. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA. \n\nCompensation \n\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and the OCC. The federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: \n\n&#8226; the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; \n\n&#8226; the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and \n\n&#8226; the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 18 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings. \n\nThe U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the SEC, jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations have not been finalized. \n\nAnti-Money Laundering \n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The BSA, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an AML program, verifying the identity of customers, verifying the identity of certain beneficial owners for legal entity customers, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. We are also required to provide our employees with AML training, designate an AML compliance officer, and undergo an annual, independent audit to assess the effectiveness of our AML program. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these AML requirements. Financial services regulators are focusing their examinations on AML compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our AML compliance programs. The federal banking agencies are required, when reviewing bank and bank holding company acquisition or merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the AML activities of the applicants. \n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (&#8220;AMLA&#8221;), enacted on January 1, 2021 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, does not directly impose new requirements on financial institutions, but requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may, over the next few years, significantly alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the BSA and the Patriot Act impose on financial institutions. The AMLA also increases penalties for violations of the BSA and significantly expands a whistleblower award program both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, issued the priorities for AML and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. \n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation \n\nThe U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: \n\n&#8226; restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and \n\n&#8226; a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. \n\nOFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 19 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRegulation of Broker-Dealers \n\nOur subsidiaries, CCMI, Citizens Securities, Inc., and JMP Securities LLC are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and subject to regulation and examination by the SEC as well as FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of issues, including capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker-dealers. \n\nHeightened Risk Governance Standards \n\nCBNA is subject to OCC guidelines imposing heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank&#8217;s risk governance framework, and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank&#8217;s board of directors. The guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners&#8217; ability to assess compliance with the OCC&#8217;s expectations. Under the guidelines, a bank may use its parent company&#8217;s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards, the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same, and certain other conditions are met. CBNA has elected to use the Parent Company&#8217;s risk governance framework. A bank&#8217;s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management. A bank&#8217;s board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines, providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management&#8217;s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank. \n\n&#160; Intellectual Property \n\nIn the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks and logos are important to the success of our business. We own and license a variety of trademarks, service marks, logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our stand-alone brands. \n\nWebsite Access to Citizens&#8217; Filings with the SEC \n\nWe maintain a website at investor.citizensbank.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports that are filed or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These documents are made available on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains an internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. \n\n"

As we are a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. We, therefore, encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, technology, regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; section in Item 7. \n\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; section above. However, there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known, and factors besides those discussed below, or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, that could also adversely affect us. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 20 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy. \n\nOur business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability, and our success rests on our ability to maintain a high-performing, customer-centric organization; develop differentiated value propositions to acquire, deepen, and retain core customer segments; build excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from our competitors; operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to self-fund investments; prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet; modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery, organizational agility and speed to market; and embed risk management within our culture and our operations. Our future success and the value of our stock will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals, including through the integration of Investors and the HSBC branches. There are risks and uncertainties, many of which are not within our control, associated with each element of our strategy. If we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy, we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material. See the &#8220;Business Strategy&#8221; section in Item 1 for further information. \n\nSupervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulator-imposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan, expand our business, continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders. \n\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the federal banking agencies (the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC), as well as the CFPB. As part of the supervisory and examination process, if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us, regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed. Such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, informal (nonpublic) or formal (public) supervisory actions or public enforcement actions, including the payment of civil money penalties, which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; section in Item 1 for further information. \n\nDifficult economic conditions, including inflationary pressures or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. \n\nRobust demand, labor shortages and supply chain constraints have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy. In response to these inflationary pressures, the FRB has raised benchmark interest rates in recent months and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly a continued high rate of inflation. Amidst these uncertainties, including potential recessionary economic conditions, financial markets have continued to experience volatility. Changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of our business and may impact our future performance. See risk factor headed &#8220;Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability&#8221; below for more information on the risks associated with changes in interest rates. \n\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting consumer demand and client purchasing power for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could adversely impact our earnings and capital. \n\nAny of the effects of these adverse economic conditions would likely have an adverse impact on our earnings, with the significance of the impact generally depending on the nature and severity of the adverse economic conditions. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 21 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nChanges in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability. \n\nNet interest income historically has been, and we anticipate that it will remain, a significant component of our total revenue. This is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments. Changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business, including net interest income, deposit costs, loan volume and delinquency, and the value of our mortgage servicing rights. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets, our net interest income may decline and, with it, a decline in our earnings may occur. Our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. \n\nWe cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Global, national, regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income and interest expense. Although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, as further discussed under the &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; section in Item 7, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability. \n\nIf our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate, then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected. \n\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates are calculated and their planned discontinuance could adversely impact our business operations and financial results. \n\nMany of our lending products, securities, derivatives, and other financial transactions utilize a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the ICE Benchmark Administration have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (LIBOR Act), enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace U. S. Dollar LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate, and in December 2022, the FRB adopted rules which identify different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer loans, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain asset-backed securities. We continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates related to the cessation of LIBOR, as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. \n\nThe discontinuation of a benchmark rate, changes in a benchmark rate, or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate, including LIBOR, could, among other things, adversely affect the value of and return on certain of our financial instruments or products, result in changes to our risk exposures, or require renegotiation of previous transactions. In addition, any such discontinuation or changes, whether actual or anticipated, could result in market volatility, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, and risks associated with customer disclosures and contract negotiations. Although the LIBOR Act includes safe harbors if the FRB-identified SOFR-based replacement rate is selected, these safe harbors are untested. As a result, and despite the enactment of the LIBOR Act, for the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings, the use or selection of a successor rate could also expose us to risks associated with disputes with customers and other market participants in connection with implementing LIBOR fallback provisions. For more information on our LIBOR transition, see the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section in Item 7. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 22 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe could fail to attract, retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel, including our senior management, other key employees or members of our Board, which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business. \n\nA cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel. Accordingly, our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel, including our senior management and other key employees and directors. The marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. For example, the increase in remote and hybrid work arrangements has also increased competition for skilled personnel, and our current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain skilled and qualified personnel. The failure to attract or retain, including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel, or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy, which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully, achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nLimitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions, such as us, can compensate their officers and employees, including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. \n\nOur ability to meet our obligations, and the cost of funds to do so, depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost. \n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations, including funding commitments, as they come due. This risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular source of funding (including, for example, secured FHLB advances), changes in credit ratings or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters. Like many banking groups, our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years, and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits. However, these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time. To the extent there is heightened competition among U.S. banks for retail customer deposits, this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits and/or retaining existing deposits, and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base. An inability to grow, or any material decrease in, our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs. \n\nMaintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging, and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us. In particular, there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions (for example, reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties), which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available. Under these circumstances, we may need to seek funds from alternative sources, potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case, or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal, in order to reduce our funding commitments. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 23 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nA reduction in our credit ratings, which are based on a number of factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nCredit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength. Other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs, could limit our access to capital markets, and otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities, including long-term debt, engage in certain longer-term derivatives transactions and retain our customers, particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us. In addition, under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts, we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts. Any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding, reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality, particularly in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, where our operations are predominately concentrated. \n\nWe have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses. Our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations, which are predominately located in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. The credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control, including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation. The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality, particularly in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, have caused, and in the future may cause, us to experience impairment charges, increased repurchase demands, higher costs, additional write-downs and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss. \n\nOur risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework&#8217;s underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. \n\nOne of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk. An important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify, measure, monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers. As this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors, it is subject to human error. In exercising their judgment, our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk, which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system. \n\nIn addition, we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers, as discussed in more detail under the &#8220;Risk Governance&#8221; and &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; sections in Item 7. However, we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives, or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it may result in an increase in the level of nonaccrual loans and a higher risk exposure for us, which could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 24 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition. \n\nFrom time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the accounting for our financial results and the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (&#8220;CECL&#8221;), that substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. Upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life. We consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As evidenced in the first half of 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19, the standard introduces heightened volatility in provision for credit losses, given uncertainty in the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts over longer time horizons, variances in the rate and composition of loan growth, and changes in overall loan portfolio size and mix. As a result, it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity could be negatively impacted. For more information regarding CECL, see Note 6 in Item 8. \n\nOur financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models. \n\nThe processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. Some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Moreover, our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect, obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur. We seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models, but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled. In such case, our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated. In addition, if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate, they could take their business elsewhere. This could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Finally, information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or insufficient. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders, could be adversely affected due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. \n\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. Particularly, various factors may cause our Allowance for Credit Losses to increase. \n\nThe preparation of audited Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Our most critical accounting estimate is the ACL. The ACL is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of expected credit losses within the existing loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments. The level of the ACL is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors, including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 25 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the ACL inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to, such as unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside our control, may require an increase in the ACL. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in the ACL or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL&#8212;that is, if the ACL is inadequate&#8212;we will need to recognize additional provision for credit losses. Should such additional provision expense become necessary, it would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us. For more information regarding our use of estimates in preparation of financial statements, see Note 1 in Item 8 and the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; section in Item 7. \n\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses. \n\nOur operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud; improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties; failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical, telecommunications or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system failures, including those caused by computer viruses, cyber-attacks against us or our vendors, or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties. Although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff, it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us. Any weakness in these systems or controls, or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations, could result in increased regulatory supervision, enforcement actions and other disciplinary action, and have an adverse impact on our business, applicable authorizations and licenses, reputation and results of operations. \n\nThe financial services industry, including the banking sector, is undergoing rapid technological change as a result of changes in customer behavior, competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework, and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes. \n\nThe financial services industry, including the banking sector, is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition, new, unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services. We believe our success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. However, we may not be able to, among other things, keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes, effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance. Our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals, final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business. Also, recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with third-party technology providers. Given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives, it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations. See &#8220;&#8212;Supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a FHC and a BHC and any regulator-imposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan, expand our business, continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 26 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business. \n\nInformation security risks for large financial institutions such as us have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as the internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems. Risks relating to cyber-attacks on our vendors and other third parties, including supply chain attacks affecting our software and information technology service providers, have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe. The possibility of employee error, failure to follow security procedures, or malfeasance also presents these risks, particularly given the recent trend towards remote work arrangements. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks as well as in the third-party computer systems and networks used to provide products and services on our behalf. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls based on our adherence to applicable laws and regulations, industry standards and best practices, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers&#8217; devices may be the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, theft, sale or loss or destruction of the confidential, and/or proprietary information of CFG, our customers, our vendors, our counterparties, or our employees. We are under continuous threat of loss or network degradation due to cyber-attacks, such as computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, ransomware, and Distributed Denial of Service (&#8220;DDoS&#8221;) attacks. This is especially true as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers&#8217; or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include Internet-based funds transfers. We have been subject to a number of e-fraud incidents historically. We have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking. Such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to us if successful. We have implemented certain technology protections such as Customer Profiling and Set-Up Authentication to be in compliance with the FFIEC Authentication and Access to Financial Institution Services and Systems guidelines. \n\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. Cyber-attacks against the patches themselves have also proven to be a significant risk that companies will have to address going forward. \n\nDespite our efforts to prevent a cyber-attack, a successful cyber-attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident or how to remediate it, and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further increase the costs and other negative consequences of the incident. Moreover, potential new regulations may require us to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 27 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems. In the event that a cyber-attack is successful, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see the &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; section of Item 1. \n\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. \n\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols, could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. Although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources (including management time and attention) to recovery and response efforts, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events, we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance. \n\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology. \n\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services. For example, (i) unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely, (ii) third parties host or maintain many of our applications, including a commercial loan system, which is hosted and maintained by Automated Financial Systems, Inc., and our Mobile Digital Banking Application, which is hosted and maintained by Amazon Web Services, Inc., (iii) Fidelity Information Services, LLC maintains our core deposits system, (iv) Infosys Limited provides us with a wide range of information technology support services, including service desk, end user support, production application support, and private cloud support, and (v) Kyndryl, Inc. provides us with mainframe support services. The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties&#8217; suppliers or vendors (so-called &#8220;fourth party risk&#8221;). For example, during 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. If we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable time frames. If these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we would not be able to serve our customers well. In either situation, our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected. \n\nWe are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates. \n\nOur success and results depend, in part, on our reputation and the strength of our brands. We are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount. We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions, press speculation and negative publicity, perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, among other factors, could damage our brands or reputation. Our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers&#8217; expectations for the product are not satisfied. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 28 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nUnpredictable catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events and other large-scale catastrophes, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. \n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as COVID-19, terrorists attacks, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, or tornadoes, and other large-scale catastrophes could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including by affecting the stability of our deposit base, impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impairing the value of collateral securing loans, causing significant property damage or operational disruptions, resulting in loss of revenue or causing us to incur additional expenses. \n\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has in the past negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, the global and U.S. economies, including by increasing unemployment levels, disrupting supply chains and businesses in many industries, lowering equity market valuations, decreasing liquidity in fixed income markets, and creating significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. This has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, higher and more volatile provisions for credit losses and has in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our noninterest income. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and capital profile, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, any resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the emergence of new variants, the widespread availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on us, our clients and customers, our service providers and other market participants. As the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. \n\nFurthermore, although we maintain both business continuity and disaster recovery plans, if a terrorist attack, extreme weather event, or other catastrophe rendered both our production data center in Rhode Island and our recovery data center in North Carolina unusable, there can be no assurance that these plans and related capabilities will adequately protect us from such events, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nThe effects of geopolitical instability, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, may adversely affect us and create significant risks and uncertainties for our business, with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. \n\nOngoing geopolitical instability, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, has negatively impacted, and could in the future negatively impact, the global and U.S. economies, including by causing supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates, rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks. The extent to which such geopolitical instability, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and capital profile, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including with respect to Russia&#8217;s invasion, the extent and duration of the invasion and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and the immeasurable humanitarian toll inflicted on Ukraine. If geopolitical instability adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our business. \n\nRisks Related to Our Industry \n\nAny deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOur business is affected by national economic conditions, as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects. Changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled. Adverse economic conditions, such as challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends, could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses, which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 29 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive, which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. The industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation. We face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services, including non-banking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and BHCs, securities firms and insurance companies, and competitors that may have greater financial resources. \n\nWith respect to non-banking financial institutions, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation, could significantly affect the competition for financial services. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as &#8220;disintermediation,&#8221; could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. As a result of these and other sources of competition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect our profitability. \n\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses and customers. \n\nThere is increasing global concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients, customers, or service providers, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. \n\nWe are also exposed to risks associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy in response to concerns around climate change. Such risks may result from changes in policies, laws and regulations, technologies, or market preferences that are intended to address climate change. These changes could materially and negatively impact our or our customers&#8217; business, results of operations, financial condition and our reputation, including as a result of our or our customers&#8217; involvement in, or decision not to participate in, certain industries or projects associated with exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs. \n\nThe conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. \n\nFinancial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Within the financial services industry, the default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions are closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis, or key funding providers such as the FHLBs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 30 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRisks Related to Regulations Governing Our Industry \n\nAs a financial holding company and a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nAs a FHC and a BHC, we are subject to comprehensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB. In addition, CBNA is subject to comprehensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. Our regulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management&#8217;s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In the course of their supervision and examinations, our regulators may require improvements in various areas. If we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to informal (nonpublic) or formal (public) supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are a BHC that has elected to become a FHC pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. FHCs are allowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a BHC is not otherwise permitted to engage. However, to maintain FHC status, a BHC (and all of its depository institution subsidiaries) must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; If a BHC ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, there are many penalties it would be faced with, including the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and it may not undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for FHCs or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If a company does not return to compliance within 180 days, which period may be extended, the FRB may require divestiture of that company&#8217;s depository institutions. To the extent we do not meet the requirements to be a FHC in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators. \n\nFrom time to time, bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution&#8217;s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements. Directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus, in some instances, we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions. In addition, as part of our regular examination process, our regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Any such actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could adversely affect our costs and revenues. Moreover, efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems, as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention. As a result, such supervisory actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations; and, in certain instances, we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 31 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings. \n\nWe are heavily regulated by multiple banking, consumer protection, securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels. This regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors, the DIF, consumers of financial products, and the financial system as a whole, not our security holders. Changes to statutes, regulations, rules or policies, including the interpretation, implementation or enforcement of statutes, regulations, rules or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by, for example, subjecting us to additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties, including non-banks, to offer competing financial services and products. In recent years, we, together with the rest of the financial services industry, have faced particularly intense scrutiny, with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities. Legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection. Certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions. Any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects. In addition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities. \n\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers, employees, counterparties and others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. \n\nWhile there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to us that have been finalized in recent years, there are other rules to implement changes that have yet to be proposed or enacted by our regulators. The final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remains uncertain. For more information on regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see the &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; section in Item 1. \n\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected. \n\nWe are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards. To the extent that we are unable to meet these standards, our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities. See &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in Item 1 and the &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; sections in Item 7, for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject. \n\nThe Parent Company could be required to act as a &#8220;source of strength&#8221; to CBNA, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nFRB policy historically required BHCs to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. This support may be required by the FRB at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of CFG or our stockholders or creditors, and may include one or more of the following: \n\n&#8226; The Parent Company may be compelled to contribute capital to CBNA, including by engaging in a public offering to raise such capital. Furthermore, any extensions of credit from the Parent Company to CBNA that are included in CBNA&#8217;s capital would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and certain other indebtedness of CBNA. \n\n&#8226; In the event of a BHC&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment that the BHC had been required to make to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. \n\n&#8226; In the event of impairment of the capital stock of CBNA, the Parent Company, as CBNA&#8217;s stockholder, could be required to pay such deficiency. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 32 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Parent Company depends on CBNA for substantially all of its revenue, and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by CBNA could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations. \n\nAs a BHC, the Parent Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from CBNA, our banking subsidiary. The Parent Company typically receives substantially all of our revenue from dividends from CBNA. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that CBNA may pay to the Parent Company. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors. In the event CBNA is unable to pay dividends to the Parent Company, it may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock. The inability to receive dividends from CBNA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section in Item 1 and the &#8220;Capital and Regulatory Matters&#8221; section in Item 7. \n\nFrom time-to-time, we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business. \n\nWe may become or are involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These regulatory actions involve, among other matters, accounting, compliance and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business. \n\nIn regulatory actions, such as those referred to above, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine, penalty or other relief, conditions or restrictions, if any, may be, particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation. The Parent Company may be required to make significant restitution payments to CBNA customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues. This uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which, in turn, can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements, fines, or penalties. Adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business. \n\nOur operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk. In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution, including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and mis-selling of certain products. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress. Moreover, a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed &#8220;lender liability.&#8221; Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders. This could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject. For more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved, see Note 19 in Item 8. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 33 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCompliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules involves significant cost and effort. \n\nWe are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges. Although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we cannot guarantee that our anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing. Any such failure events may have severe consequences, including sanctions, fines and reputational consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nRisks Related to our Common Stock \n\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. \n\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the factors described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: \n\n&#8226; quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us; \n\n&#8226; changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; \n\n&#8226; our announcements or our competitors&#8217; announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; \n\n&#8226; future sales of our common stock; \n\n&#8226; additions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel; \n\n&#8226; changes in industry conditions or perceptions; and \n\n&#8226; changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and other dynamics. \n\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. \n\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. \n\nWe may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock. \n\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, as a BHC, our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the rules of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends. Additionally, we are also generally required to receive the FRB&#8217;s approval for any dividends, share repurchases, or redemption of capital securities if we are required to resubmit our capital plan. Further, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason, we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock. See the &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; section in Item 1, for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 34 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8220;Anti-takeover&#8221; provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. \n\nWe are a BHC incorporated in the state of Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold. \n\nFurthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect &#8220;control&#8221; of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. \n\n"

The transaction extends our physical presence and adds customers in several attractive markets, accelerating our national expansion strategy. The transaction includes 66 branches in the New York City metropolitan area, 9 branches in the Mid-Atlantic/Washington D.C. area, and 5 branches in Southeast Florida. \n\nOn April 6, 2022, Citizens completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Investors for a combination of stock and cash. The acquisition enhances Citizens&#8217; banking franchise, adding an attractive middle market, small business and consumer customer base while building our physical presence in the Mid-Atlantic region with the addition of 154 branches located in the greater New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and across New Jersey. \n\nOn June 8, 2022, Citizens completed the acquisition of DH Capital, a private investment banking firm serving companies in the internet infrastructure, software, IT services and communications sectors. This acquisition further strengthens our growing corporate advisory capabilities. \n\nFor additional information regarding these acquisitions see Note 2. \n\nThe following MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, as well as other information contained in this document. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nThis document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as &#8220;Underlying&#8221; results. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. \n\nOther companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. \n\nNon-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&#38;A by the use of the term Underlying. Where there is a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when applicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see &#8220;&#8212;Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.&#8221; \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 39 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \n\nKey Highlights \n\nNet income decreased $246 million, with earnings per diluted common share down $1.06 to $4.10 compared to 2021. \n\nResults reflect notable items of $352 million or $0.74 per diluted common share, net of tax benefit, compared to $78 million or $0.18 per diluted common share, net of tax benefit, in 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 1: Notable Items Year Ended December 31, 2022 Less: notable items (in millions) Reported results (GAAP) Integration related costs (1) \n\nTOP and other (2) \n\nProvision (3) \n\nUnderlying results (non-GAAP) Provision (benefit) for credit losses $474 $&#8212; $&#8212; $169 $305 Noninterest income 2,009 (31) &#8212; &#8212; 2,040 Noninterest expense 4,892 213 49 &#8212; 4,630 Income tax expense 582 (58) (9) (43) 692 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2021 Less: notable items (in millions) Reported results (GAAP) Integration related costs (1) \n\nTOP and other (2) \n\nProvision Underlying results (non-GAAP) Provision (benefit) for credit losses ($411) $&#8212; $&#8212; $&#8212; ($411) Noninterest income 2,135 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 2,135 Noninterest expense 4,081 35 70 &#8212; 3,976 Income tax expense 658 (9) (18) &#8212; 685 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes integration related costs associated with acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and mark-to-market losses on loans acquired from Investors classified as LHFS for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\n(2) Includes our TOP transformational and revenue and efficiency initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, income tax impacts related to legacy tax matters for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a pension settlement charge and compensation-related credit for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n(3) Includes the initial provision for credit losses of $169 million tied to the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition.

The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates.

Average interest-earning asset yields increased 71 basis points to 3.61%, while average interest-bearing liability costs increased 48 basis points to 0.78% compared to 2021. \n\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $27.6 billion, or 17%, compared to 2021. Interest earning assets increased, reflecting the impacts of the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition. Growth in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, home equity, and investments was partially offset by a decrease in cash held in interest-bearing deposits reflecting the deployment of elevated liquidity. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 42 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAverage deposits increased $21.6 billion, or 14%, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition. \n\nAverage total borrowed funds increased $6.2 billion compared to 2021, given an increase in long-term and short-term FHLB borrowings driven by advances acquired from Investors and the funding of loan and security growth, partially offset by a decrease in senior debt. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 3: Changes in Net Interest Income Due to Average Volume and Average Rate Year Ended December 31, 2022 Versus 2021 \n\n(in millions) Average Volume (1) \n\nAverage Rate (1) \n\nNet Change Interest Income Interest-bearing cash and due from banks and deposits in banks ($7) $119 $112 Taxable investment securities 142 211 353 Total investment securities 142 211 353 Commercial and industrial 203 340 543 Commercial real estate 265 381 646 Leases (6) 3 (3) Total commercial 462 724 1,186 Residential mortgages 212 51 263 Home Equity 36 149 185 Automobile 29 (28) 1 Education 16 8 24 Other retail (8) 64 56 Total retail 285 244 529 Total loans and leases 747 968 1,715 Loans held for sale, at fair value (38) 23 (15) Other loans held for sale 46 (2) 44 Total interest income $890 $1,319 $2,209 Interest Expense Checking with interest $8 $110 $118 Money market (2) 244 242 Savings 7 74 81 Term 9 41 50 Total interest-bearing deposits 22 469 491 Short-term borrowed funds 17 5 22 Long-term borrowed funds 40 156 196 Total borrowed funds 57 161 218 Total interest expense 79 630 709 Net interest income $811 $689 $1,500 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Volume and rate changes have been allocated on a consistent basis using the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 43 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNoninterest Income \n\n##TABLE_START Table 4: Noninterest Income Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Change Percent Service charges and fees $420 $409 $11 3 % Capital markets fees 368 428 (60) (14) Card fees 273 250 23 9 Mortgage banking fees 261 434 (173) (40) Trust and investment services fees 249 239 10 4 Foreign exchange and derivative products 188 120 68 57 Letter of credit and loan fees 159 156 3 2 Securities gains, net 9 10 (1) (10) \n\nOther income (1) \n\n82 89 (7) (8) Noninterest income $2,009 $2,135 ($126) (6 %) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes bank-owned life insurance income and other income for all periods presented. \n\nNoninterest income decreased $126 million, or 6%, compared to 2021, highlighted by the following significant changes. \n\n&#8226; Mortgage banking fees declined given lower production volumes and gain-on-sale margins, partially offset by higher servicing revenue. \n\n&#8226; Foreign exchange and derivative products revenue increased reflecting growth in client hedging activity across foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity products. \n\n&#8226; Capital markets fees decreased reflecting lower underwriting, merger and acquisition advisory, and loan syndication fees given challenging market conditions. \n\n&#8226; Card fees increased driven by higher debit and credit card volumes. \n\n&#8226; Trust and investment services fees increased driven by higher annuity fees. \n\n&#8226; Other income declined driven by $31 million of mark-to-market losses on loans acquired from Investors classified as LHFS, partially offset by higher bank-owned life insurance and leasing income. \n\nNoninterest Expense \n\n##TABLE_START Table 5: Noninterest Expense Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Change Percent \n\nSalaries and employee benefits $2,549 $2,132 $417 20 % Outside services 700 595 105 18 Equipment and software 648 610 38 6 Occupancy 410 333 77 23 Other operating expense 585 411 174 42 Noninterest expense $4,892 $4,081 $811 20 % ##TABLE_END\n\nNoninterest expense increased $811 million, or 20%, compared to 2021, driven primarily by acquisition and integration-related costs, higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense associated with FDIC insurance, travel and advertising costs, partially offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 44 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nProvision for Credit Losses \n\nThe provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded commitments. Refer to &#8220;&#8212;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonaccrual Loans and Leases&#8221; for more information. \n\nThe credit provision expense of $474 million for 2022 includes the &#8220;double count&#8221; for the non-PCD loan CECL provision expense of $169 million tied to the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition and compares to a credit provision benefit of $411 million for 2021. In addition to the purchase accounting impacts from the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition, the provision expense for 2022 reflected deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic environment, including an increased risk of recession. The credit provision benefit for 2021 reflected the strong economic recovery driven by highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies in place during that time. \n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense of $582 million decreased $76 million compared to 2021. The effective income tax rate of 21.9% decreased from 22.1% compared to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in benefits from tax-advantaged investments, bank-owned life insurance, and other tax credits, partially offset by impacts from the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition. \n\nBusiness Operating Segments \n\nWe have two business operating segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Segment results are determined based on our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and statement of operations items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure. The results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. \n\nDeveloping and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated, or our organizational structure changes. \n\nFor more information regarding our business operating segments see Note 26. \n\nThe following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments. Total business operating segment financial results differ from total consolidated financial results. These differences are reflected in Other non-segment operations. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 6: Selected Financial Data for Business Operating Segments Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net interest income $4,043 $3,562 $2,103 $1,706 Noninterest income 1,063 1,223 845 809 Total revenue 5,106 4,785 2,948 2,515 Noninterest expense 3,391 2,987 1,223 973 Profit before credit losses 1,715 1,798 1,725 1,542 Net charge-offs 226 185 46 156 Income before income tax expense 1,489 1,613 1,679 1,386 Income tax expense 381 410 375 300 Net income $1,108 $1,203 $1,304 $1,086 Average Balances: Total assets $86,147 $75,509 $74,919 $57,617 \n\nTotal loans and leases (1) \n\n80,572 71,126 70,992 54,734 Deposits 114,482 100,195 49,898 44,747 Interest-earning assets 81,338 72,034 71,276 55,096 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes LHFS. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 45 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nConsumer Banking \n\nNet interest income increased $481 million, or 14%, compared to 2021, driven by higher net interest margin and growth in average interest-earning assets, including the impacts of the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in PPP loans and higher funding costs. Average loans increased $9.4 billion, or 13%, compared to 2021, reflecting the impacts of the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition, as well as strength in mortgage and home equity. This increase was partially offset by a decline in PPP loans and planned runoff in auto and personal unsecured installment loans. Average deposits increased $14.3 billion, or 14%, compared to 2021, reflecting the impacts of the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition. \n\nNoninterest income decreased $160 million, or 13%, compared to 2021, driven by lower mortgage banking fees reflecting lower gain-on-sale margins and production volumes, partially offset by higher servicing revenue. This decrease was partially offset by higher card fees given higher transaction volumes, and higher trust and investment services fees given higher annuity fees. \n\nNoninterest expense increased $404 million, or 14%, compared to 2021, driven primarily by acquisition impacts, higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense associated with FDIC insurance, travel and advertising costs, partially offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives \n\nNet charge-offs increased $41 million, or 22%, compared to 2021, reflecting the normalization of the credit cycle. \n\nCommercial Banking \n\nNet interest income increased $397 million, or 23%, compared to 2021, driven by higher net interest margin and growth in average interest-earning assets, including the impact of the Investors acquisition. This increase was partially offset by higher funding costs. \n\nNoninterest income increased $36 million, or 4%, compared to 2021, driven by higher foreign exchange and derivative products revenue reflecting growth in client hedging activity across foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity products, higher service charges and fees reflecting the benefit of acquisitions, and higher card fees given higher transaction volumes. This increase was partially offset by lower capital markets fees reflecting lower underwriting, merger and acquisition advisory, and loan syndication fees given challenging market conditions. \n\nNoninterest expense increased $250 million , or 26%, compared to 2021 , driven primarily by acquisition impacts, higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expense associated with FDIC insurance, travel and advertising costs, partially offset by the benefit of efficiency initiatives. \n\nNet charge-offs decreased $110 million, or 71%, compared to 2021, as credit performance remained strong. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; 2021 compared with 2020 \n\nFor a description of our results of operations for 2021, see the &#8220;Results of Operations &#8212; 2021 compared with 2020&#8221; section of Item 7 in our 2021 Form 10-K. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 46 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION \n\nSecurities \n\n##TABLE_START Table 7: Amortized Cost and Fair Value of AFS and HTM Securities December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value U.S. Treasury and other $3,678 $3,486 $11 $11 State and political subdivisions 2 2 2 2 Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 21,250 19,062 24,607 24,442 Other/non-agency 280 251 397 405 Total mortgage-backed securities 21,530 19,313 25,004 24,847 Collateralized loan obligations 1,248 1,206 1,208 1,207 Total debt securities available for sale, at fair value $26,458 $24,007 $26,225 $26,067 Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities $9,253 $8,506 $1,505 $1,557 Total mortgage-backed securities 9,253 8,506 1,505 1,557 Asset-backed securities 581 536 737 732 Total debt securities held to maturity $9,834 $9,042 $2,242 $2,289 Total debt securities available for sale and held to maturity $36,292 $33,049 $28,467 $28,356 Equity securities, at cost \n\n$1,058 $1,058 $624 $624 Equity securities, at fair value 153 153 109 109 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur securities portfolio is managed to maintain prudent levels of liquidity, credit quality, and market risk while achieving returns that align with our overall portfolio management strategy.

Holdings backed by mortgages dominate our portfolio and facilitate our ability to pledge those securities to the FHLB for collateral purposes. \n\nThe fair value of the debt securities portfolio increased $4.7 billion from December 31, 2021, driven in large part by the Investors acquisition as well as net securities purchases. \n\nThe amortized cost basis of the HTM portfolio increased $7.6 billion due to the transfer of $8.5 billion from the AFS portfolio during 2022, offset in part by paydowns. The ratio of HTM securities to total securities increased to 29% as of December 31, 2022. \n\nWe manage our securities portfolio duration and convexity risk through asset selection and securities structure, and maintain duration levels within our risk appetite in the context of the broader interest rate risk framework and limits. As of December 31, 2022, the portfolio&#8217;s average effective duration was 5.8 years compared to 4.3 years as of December 31, 2021, as higher long-term rates drove a decrease in both actual and projected securities prepayment speeds. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 47 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 8: Amortized Cost of AFS and HTM Securities by Contractual Maturity As of December 31, 2022 Distribution of Maturities (1) \n\n1 Year or Less After 1 Year Through 5 Years After 5 Years Through 10 Years After 10 Years Total (dollars in millions) Amount Yield (2) \n\nAmount Yield (2) \n\nAmount Yield (2) \n\nAmount Yield (2) \n\nAmount Yield (2) \n\nAmortized cost: U.S. Treasury and other $&#8212; &#8212; % $2,114 2.44 % $1,564 2.76 % $&#8212; &#8212; % $3,678 2.58 % State and political subdivisions &#8212; 5.25 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 2 2.60 2 2.68 Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 1 1.98 1,149 3.16 2,889 2.98 17,211 2.87 21,250 2.90 Other/non-agency &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 280 2.60 280 2.60 Collateralized loan obligations &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 24 5.79 1,224 5.43 1,248 5.44 Total debt securities available for sale 1 2.10 3,263 2.70 4,477 2.92 18,717 3.03 26,458 2.97 Mortgage-backed securities: \n\nFederal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 9,253 2.33 9,253 2.33 Asset-backed securities &#8212; &#8212; 581 3.80 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 581 3.80 Total debt securities held to maturity &#8212; &#8212; 581 3.80 &#8212; &#8212; 9,253 2.33 9,834 2.44 Total debt securities $1 2.10 % $3,844 2.86 % $4,477 2.92 % $27,970 2.80 % $36,292 2.82 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without incurring penalties. \n\n(2) The weighted-average yield is computed based on a constant effective interest rate over the contractual life of each security and considers the contractual \n\ncoupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.

Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues to evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. For more information, see the &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; section in Item 1. \n\nCapital Adequacy Process \n\nOur assessment of capital adequacy begins with our Board-approved risk appetite and risk management framework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks. Capital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies. The assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Key analytical frameworks, including scenario analysis and stress testing, supplement our base line forecast to help inform a range of potential outcomes. A governance framework supports our capital planning process, including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our Capital Contingency Plan and the active engagement of both the legal-entity boards and senior management in oversight and decision-making. \n\nForward-looking assessments of capital adequacy feed development of a single capital plan covering us and our banking subsidiary that is periodically submitted to the FRB. We prepare this plan in full compliance with the FRB&#8217;s Capital Plan Rule and we participate annually in the FRB&#8217;s horizontal capital review, which is the FRB&#8217;s assessment of specific capital planning areas, as part of their normal supervisory process. \n\nUnder the FRB&#8217;s Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms, such as us, are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB supervises Category IV firms on an ongoing basis, including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during off-cycle years. Annually, the FRB requires us to submit a capital plan approved by our Board of Directors or one of its committees. We submitted our 2022 Capital Plan to the FRB on April 4, 2022, and must submit our 2023 Capital Plan by April 5, 2023. We expect the FRB to provide us with our preliminary SCB requirement in June 2023 and our final SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The final SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 2023 and will remain in effect until September 30, 2024. For more information, see the &#8220;Tailoring of Prudential Requirements&#8221; section in Item 1. \n\nUnder the SCB framework, the FRB will not object to capital plans on quantitative grounds and each firm is required to maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum and SCB requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. \n\nFor Category IV firms, like us, the SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. On August 4, 2022, the FRB announced, based on the results of the 2022 CCAR supervisory stress tests, that our SCB will remain at 3.4% through September 30, 2023. To incorporate the effects of the Investors acquisition on our capital requirements, the FRB will require that we participate in the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test. \n\nRegulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 56 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRegulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition \n\nUnder the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a BHC, our SCB of 3.4% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for CBNA. \n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, the CET1 deduction threshold for MSRs, certain deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions is 25%. As of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the threshold for these additional capital deductions. MSRs or certain deferred tax assets not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned a 250% risk weight and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from CET1 capital are assigned an exposure category risk weight. \n\nIn reaction to the COVID disruption, the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of the ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. The three-year transition period will phase-in the reversal of the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. On December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of capital benefit was $384 million. The reduction in the capital benefit in 2022 was $96 million, or approximately 6 basis points. \n\nThe table below presents our actual regulatory capital ratios under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules: \n\n##TABLE_START Table 22: Regulatory Capital Ratios Under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Rules December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Required Minimum Capital Ratios (1) \n\n(in millions, except ratio data) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio CET1 capital $18,574 10.0 % $15,656 9.9 % 7.9 % Tier 1 capital 20,588 11.1 17,670 11.1 9.4 Total capital 23,755 12.8 20,244 12.7 11.4 Tier 1 leverage 20,588 9.3 17,670 9.7 4.0 Risk-weighted assets 185,224 158,831 \n\nQuarterly adjusted average assets (2) \n\n220,779 181,800 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents minimum requirement under the current capital framework plus the SCB of 3.4%. The SCB is not applicable to the Tier 1 leverage ratio. \n\n(2) Represents total average assets less certain amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our CET1 ratio increased, given the common stock issued in connection with the Investors acquisition and net income, partially offset by a $26.4 billion increase in RWA, higher goodwill and intangibles related to the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition, dividends and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the first year of the CECL three-year transition period. The Tier 1 capital ratio was flat compared to 2021. The total capital ratio increased due to the changes in the CET1 capital ratio described above, combined with a net increase in subordinated debt and AACL related to the Investors acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in the modified AACL transition amount. At December 31, 2022, our CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were approximately 210 basis points, 170 basis points and 140 basis points, respectively, above their required minimums. \n\nBoth the Company and CBNA are subject to the standardized approach for determining RWA. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s RWA totaled $185.2 billion, up $26.4 billion from December 31, 2021, largely driven by the Investors acquisition. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.3%, down from 9.7% at December 31, 2021, driven by an increase in quarterly adjusted average assets of $39.0 billion, partially offset by higher tier 1 capital. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 57 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Table 23: Capital Composition Under the U.S. Basel III Capital Framework (in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total common stockholders&#8217; equity $21,676 $21,406 Exclusions: Modified CECL transitional amount 288 384 Net unrealized (gains)/losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax: Debt and equity securities 2,771 156 Derivatives 1,416 160 Unamortized net periodic benefit costs 373 349 Deductions: Goodwill, net of deferred tax liability (7,780) (6,733) Other intangible assets, net of deferred tax liability (170) (66) Deferred tax assets that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards &#8212; &#8212; Total common equity tier 1 capital 18,574 15,656 Qualifying preferred stock 2,014 2,014 Total tier 1 capital 20,588 17,670 \n\nQualifying subordinated debt (1) \n\n1,427 1,138 Allowance for credit losses 2,240 1,934 Exclusions from tier 2 capital: Modified AACL transitional amount (374) (498) Allowance on PCD assets (126) &#8212; Adjusted allowance for credit losses $1,740 $1,436 Total capital $23,755 $20,244 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of non-qualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was $367 million and $420 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022 we had $850 million available for future share repurchases under this authorization. In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved a three-cent increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.42 per share. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors prior to execution. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, receipt of required regulatory approvals and other regulatory considerations. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 58 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBanking Subsidiary&#8217;s Capital \n\n##TABLE_START Table 24: CBNA's Capital Ratios Under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Rules December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions, except ratio data) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio CET1 capital $20,669 11.2 % $17,039 10.7 % Tier 1 capital 20,669 11.2 17,039 10.7 Total capital 23,534 12.7 19,600 12.4 Tier 1 leverage 20,669 9.4 17,039 9.4 Risk-weighted assets 184,781 158,550 \n\nQuarterly adjusted average assets (1) \n\n220,182 181,268 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents total average assets less certain amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital. \n\nCBNA&#8217;s CET1 and tier 1 capital totaled $20.7 billion at December 31, 2022, up $3.6 billion from $17.0 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase related to a capital contribution from the Parent Company in connection with the Investors acquisition as well as CBNA&#8217;s net income, partially offset by higher goodwill and intangibles related to the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition, a dividend payment to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the first year of the CECL three-year transition period. Total capital was $23.5 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $3.9 billion from $19.6 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by the change in CET1 capital and an increase in AACL related to the Investors acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in the modified AACL transition amount. \n\nCBNA&#8217;s RWA totaled $184.8 billion at December 31, 2022, up $26.2 billion from December 31, 2021, largely driven by the Investors acquisition. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, CBNA&#8217;s tier 1 leverage ratio remained flat at 9.4% as the increase in quarterly adjusted average assets was offset by higher tier 1 capital. \n\nLIQUIDITY \n\nWe define liquidity as our ability to meet our cash-flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. An institution, such as us, must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. Reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and unused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength. We manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity, including at the Parent Company and CBNA level. \n\nParent Company Liquidity \n\nOur Parent Company&#8217;s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA resulting from investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior debt and subordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including CBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Parent Company issued $400 million of 5.641% fixed-rate reset subordinated notes. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Parent Company declared dividends on common stock of $779 million and $670 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $113 million. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Parent Company repurchased $153 million and $295 million, respectively, of its outstanding common stock. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 59 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur Parent Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Parent Company&#8217;s double-leverage ratio (the combined equity investment in Parent Company subsidiaries divided by Parent Company equity) is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund Parent Company obligations. The Parent Company&#8217;s double-leverage ratio was 101.2% and 98.5% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCBNA Liquidity \n\nAs CBNA&#8217;s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching sources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale borrowings, as needed, and as described under &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.&#8221; The primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of loans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA has relied on wholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on CBNA&#8217;s outstanding debt see Note 13. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, CBNA completed the following transactions: \n\n&#8226; Issued $650 million of 4.119% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes; \n\n&#8226; Issued $800 million of 4.575% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes; \n\n&#8226; Issued $600 million of 6.064% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes; and \n\n&#8226; Redeemed $1.0 billion and $750 million of senior notes due February and May 2022, respectively. \n\nLiquidity Risk \n\nWe define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk and/or funding liquidity risk. \n\nContingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entity&#8217;s ability to liquidate, pledge and/or finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets. Drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality and/or valuation of a security or loan, issuer or borrower and/or asset class. \n\nFunding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions and/or entity-specific events may reduce an entity&#8217;s ability to raise funds from depositors and/or wholesale market counterparties. Drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic, reflecting impediments to operations and/or damaged market confidence. \n\nFactors Affecting Liquidity \n\nGiven the composition of assets and borrowing sources, contingent liquidity risk at CBNA would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for high-quality securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities and other instruments issued by the GNMA, FNMA and the FHLMC), by any inability of the FHLBs to provide collateralized advances and/or by a refusal of the FRB to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress. \n\nSimilarly, given the structure of its balance sheet, the funding liquidity risk of CBNA would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or a combination of both. Consequently, and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events, we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively low. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 60 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAn additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination (i.e., uninsured) customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as Moody&#8217;s, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 25: Credit Ratings &#160; December 31, 2022 &#160; Moody&#8217;s \n\nStandard and Poor&#8217;s Fitch \n\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc.: &#160; &#160; &#160; Long-term issuer NR BBB+ BBB+ Short-term issuer NR A-2 F1 Subordinated debt NR BBB BBB Preferred Stock NR BB+ BB Citizens Bank, National Association: Long-term issuer Baa1 A- BBB+ Short-term issuer NR A-2 F1 Long-term deposits A1 NR A- Short-term deposits P-1 NR F1 ##TABLE_END NR = Not Rated \n\nChanges in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding. As a result, and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile, CBNA continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding. At December 31, 2022, our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the Parent Company and CBNA, and collateralized advances from the FHLB. \n\nExisting and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB, OCC, and FDIC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. For further discussion, see the &#8220;Regulation and Supervision &#8212; Tailoring of Prudential Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Liquidity Requirements&#8221; sections in Item 1. \n\nLiquidity Risk Management and Governance \n\nLiquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. In managing liquidity risk, the Funding and Liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting, including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators, explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies. \n\nOur Funding and Liquidity unit&#8217;s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits, by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding, particularly short-term unsecured funding, and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities. As of December 31, 2022: \n\n&#8226; Organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated period-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 86.7%; \n\n&#8226; Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity, was approximately $72.3 billion; \n\n&#8226; Contingent liquidity was $48.1 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities of $27.6 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $11.5 billion, and our cash balances at the FRB of $9.0 billion; and \n\n&#8226; Available discount window capacity was $24.2 billion, defined as available total borrowing capacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, which is primarily secured by non-mortgage commercial and retail loans. Use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 61 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFor a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. \n\nThe Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows: \n\n&#8226; Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the FRB, free and liquid securities, and secured FHLB borrowing capacity; \n\n&#8226; Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving regulatory requirements; and \n\n&#8226; Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and cumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons. \n\nFurther, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available FHLB borrowing capacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also forecasted over a one-year horizon. \n\nContractual Obligations \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, lease obligations and other cash commitments. For more information regarding these obligations, see Notes 9, 12 and 13. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nWe engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are generally referred to as &#8220;off-balance sheet arrangements.&#8221; For more information on these types of activities, see Note 19. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nOur audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAn accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. See Note 1 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe ACL increased from $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022. \n\nOur ACL as of December 31, 2022 accounts for an economic forecast over our two-year reasonable and supportable period with peak unemployment of approximately 6%, peak-to-trough GDP decline of approximately 1.4%, and collateral value peak-to-trough declines of approximately 13% in home and approximately 16% in used auto and truck. This forecast incorporates the increased risk of a moderate recession beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 and persisting for four consecutive quarters. This compares to our December 31, 2021 forecast which reflected 2022 real GDP growth of 2.8% and an average unemployment rate of 6%, and 2023 real GDP growth of 2.1% and average unemployment rate of 4.3%. \n\nOur determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that monetary tightening triggers a deeper real GDP contraction across our two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, resulting in a 1.7% peak-to-trough decline in real GDP. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.17x our modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $300 million. This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 62 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nBecause several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates. \n\nIt remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product types. The variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy, including changing monetary and fiscal policies and their impact on inflationary trends, as well as continuing supply-chain challenges. Changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses. \n\nFor additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 1 and Note 6. \n\nFair Value \n\nWe asses the fair value of assets and liabilities by applying various valuation methodologies which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued. Quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale. Assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations, capitalized servicing assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, estimated residual values of property associated with leases, and certain derivative and other financial instruments. \n\nAssumptions management uses to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist include discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of fair value, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or disclosures of fair value information. \n\nIn addition to valuation, we must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Examples include certain investments, capitalized servicing assets, goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. \n\nFor additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see Notes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 20 in Item 8. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 63 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS \n\nAccounting standards issued but not adopted as of December 31, 2022 \n\n##TABLE_START Pronouncement Summary of Guidance Effects on Financial Statements \n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures \n\nIssued March 2022 \n\n&#8226; Eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs. \n\n&#8226; Requires evaluation of all modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to determine whether the modification results in a new loan or continuation of an existing loan. \n\n&#8226; Requires expected credit losses measured under a discounted cash flow method to be determined using an effective interest rate based on the modified (not original) contractual terms of the loan. \n\n&#8226; Enhances disclosures by creditors for modifications of receivables from borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term extension. \n\n&#8226; Requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage year for loans and net investments in leases. \n\n&#8226; Transition is prospective, with an option to adopt the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. \n\n&#8226; Required effective date: January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted.

A key aspect of our Board&#8217;s responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood. \n\nTo enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level risk committees. The Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the Executive Risk Committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and Operational Risk, Model Risk, Credit Policy, Asset Liability, Business Initiatives Review, and Conduct and Ethics. \n\nRisk Framework \n\nOur risk management framework is embedded in our business through a &#8220;Three Lines of Defense&#8221; model which defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities. \n\nFirst Line of Defense \n\nThe business lines (including their associated support functions) are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide. The business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis, establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk. \n\nSecond Line of Defense \n\nThe second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies. This centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks, including credit, market, operational, regulatory, reputational, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks. \n\nThird Line of Defense \n\nOur Internal Audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. Internal Audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records, physical properties and personnel. Internal Audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the Board&#8217;s Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. \n\nCredit Review reports to the Chief Audit Executive and provides the legal-entity boards, senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed Credit Risk Appetite and Credit Policies and processes. In line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the Credit Review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four Risk Pillars of Asset Quality, Rating and Data Integrity, Risk Management and Credit Risk Appetite. \n\nRisk Appetite \n\nRisk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. We define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations. \n\nOur principal non-market risks include credit, operational, regulatory, reputational, liquidity and strategic risks. We are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of interest rates, foreign exchange risk and non-trading activities within capital markets. We have established \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 65 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nenterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report on market risk. We actively manage both trading and non-trading market risks. See &#8220;&#8212;Market Risk&#8221; for further information. Our risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the Board Risk Committee. \n\nCredit Risk \n\nOverview \n\nCredit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. While the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. Given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall risk-management responsibility. \n\nObjective \n\nThe independent Credit Risk Function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products, approving larger and higher risk credit transactions, monitoring portfolio performance, identifying problem credit exposures, and ensuring remedial management. \n\nOrganizational Structure \n\nManagement and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense. The second line of defense, the independent Credit Risk Function, is led by the Chief Credit Officer who oversees all of our credit risk. The Chief Credit Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer, acting in a manner consistent with Board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around policies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. The Chief Credit Officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher risk transactions and oversight of line of business credit risk activities. Reporting to the Chief Credit Officer are the heads of the second line of defense credit functions specializing in: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, Citizens Restructuring Management, Portfolio and Corporate Reporting, ALLL Analytics, Current Expected Credit Loss, and Credit Policy and Administration. Each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies. These policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite. Material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the Credit Policy Committee, Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee for approval, as appropriate. \n\nKey Management Processes \n\nWe employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle (origination, account management/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery). \n\nConsumer \n\nOn the Consumer Banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan. Starting at origination, credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant. When approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value, collateral type, and lien subordination. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 66 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTo ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams, lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter. The amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual. We periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority. Only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present. There are exception limits which, when reached, trigger a comprehensive analysis. \n\nOnce an account is established, credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. Our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency. \n\nCommercial \n\nOn the Commercial Banking side of credit risk, risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into commercial and industrial loans, CRE and leases. Within commercial and industrial loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending, leasing, franchise finance, health care, technology and mid-corporate). A &#8220;specialty vertical&#8221; is a stand-alone team of industry or product specialists. Substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. CRE also operates as a specialty vertical. \n\nCommercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few exceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. The underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the PD and LGD. All material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority. The approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the PD. The checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. All authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent Credit Risk function and is closely monitored and updated regularly. \n\nThe primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrower&#8217;s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. In addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review, our Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations. This group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management. \n\nThe maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. Concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets, although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. \n\nSubstantially all loans categorized as Classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals. \n\nMARKET RISK \n\nMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As described below, more material market risk arises from our non-trading banking activities, such as the origination of loans and deposit-gathering. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and trading activities. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 67 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNon-Trading Risk \n\nOur non-trading banking activities expose us to market risk. This market risk is composed of interest rate risk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nInterest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and equity. We refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as &#8220;structural interest rate risk&#8221; or &#8220;interest rate risk in the banking book.&#8221; \n\nA major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity. There are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/or repricing of assets and liabilities. For example, the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in the benchmark rate, while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period. There may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes. Loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as LIBOR or Prime, while deposits may be only loosely correlated with LIBOR and dependent upon competitive demand. Due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates. \n\nAnother important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. For example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty. The exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above. \n\nA primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating-rate loans relative to core deposit funding. This source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve. \n\nThe secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixed-rate loans, as well as prepayment risk on mortgage-related loans and securities funded by non-rate sensitive deposits and equity. \n\nThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. To ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite, we must measure the exposure and hedge it, as necessary. The Treasury Asset and Liability Management team is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position. These exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the Asset Liability Committee and at Board meetings. \n\nWe measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-term and long-term exposures. The primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a three-year horizon. Exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios. \n\nKey assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. The repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities, as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments are the most significant behavioral assumptions. For projections of deposit rates, the bank utilizes product level models that consider the specific product characteristics and composition of the deposit portfolio along with current and forward-looking market dynamics. Similarly, the bank employs dynamic prepayment and mortgage rate models to project prepayment behaviors specific to each of our product offerings. These models have been developed based on internal performance data over prior interest rate cycles and are calibrated to our experience and outlook for rates across a diverse set of market environments. We assess our models and assumptions periodically by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes to inputs or assumptions on our risk results. The results of these analyses are reported to the Asset Liability Committee. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 68 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSince we cannot predict the future path of interest rates, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a &#8220;most likely&#8221; (implied forward) scenario, as well as a variety of extreme and unlikely scenarios. These scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short- or long-term rates predominate. Generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized. \n\nThe table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. Our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As the following table illustrates, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive; net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and, therefore, have a more modest impact. \n\nThe table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve: \n\n##TABLE_START Table 26: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income Estimated % Change in Net Interest Income over 12 Months December 31, Basis points 2022 2021 Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates &#160; &#160; +200 4.8 % 19.4 % +100 2.4 10.2 -100 (2.5) (8.5) -200 (5.6) (8.5) Gradual Change in Interest Rates +200 2.7 % 10.1 % +100 1.4 5.2 -100 (1.4) (6.0) -200 (3.0) (7.7) ##TABLE_END\n\nWe continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy, changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet. Asset sensitivity against a 200-basis point gradual increase in rates was 2.7% on December 31, 2022, compared with 10.1% on December 31, 2021. The change reflects rising base net interest income, including the impact of the Investors acquisition, and our ongoing hedge activity, which locks in higher forward rates and reduces our exposure to evolving downside risks. This reduction in asset sensitivity is partially offset by growth and a mix shift towards a higher proportion of floating rate consumer and commercial lending. Current levels of asset sensitivity will continue to provide upside benefit to net interest income as we progress through a period of expected higher short-term policy rates from the FRB. Changes in interest rates can also affect risk management activities, which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty. The risk position is managed within our risk limits, and long-term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments, interest rate swaps and mix of funding. \n\nWe use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, EVE, as a supplement to net interest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities.

In 2018, we formed a LIBOR Transition Program (&#8220;the Program&#8221;) designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of LIBOR. The Program, with direction and oversight from our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for developing, maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from LIBOR. The Program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance, transition management, communications, exposure management, new alternative reference rate product delivery, risk management, contract remediation, operations and technology readiness, and regulation impacts. On a quarterly basis we track and review the risks associated with the LIBOR transition with a focus on the identification of mitigation actions. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 70 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe ARRC recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates, such as SOFR, by the end of September 2020. Guided by this milestone, we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions. On March 5, 2021, the FCA formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the ICE Benchmark Administration. Further, the FCA stated that the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease as of December 31, 2021 and all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors will cease as of June 30, 2023. With the FRB, OCC, and FDIC (collectively, the agencies) supporting this announcement, the Program adjusted LIBOR transition activities and timelines accordingly. The agencies urged market participants to stop entering into new U.S. Dollar LIBOR contracts as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of 2021. We moved new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of 2021 in anticipation of this deadline. However, our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid-2023 given the FCA announcement. More broadly, program governance remains robust, and progress has been made in the above-outlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition. \n\nUpon commencement of the Program, we conducted an impact assessment to identify all areas that were likely to be impacted by the LIBOR transition. The impact assessment identified where LIBOR-related products, systems, models, policies and procedures existed. We used the assessment results to develop a robust transition roadmap and an implementation plan, which continues to evolve, based on market and regulatory developments. Key LIBOR transition efforts over the course of 2022 included, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n&#8226; Upgraded standard form provisions and issued implementation guidance to require the use of reference rate fallback language in any new and existing LIBOR contracts in connection with contract amendments made in the ordinary course of business; \n\n&#8226; Offered new product issuances with alternative reference rates; \n\n&#8226; Launched remediation of existing LIBOR loans and derivatives to alternative reference rates; \n\n&#8226; Completed operational readiness of systems, models and applications to handle all potential alternative reference rates; \n\n&#8226; Analyzed existing fallback language in legacy contracts to devise a strategy for those requiring remediation; \n\n&#8226; Continued to develop and enhance internet and intranet sites for the LIBOR transition; and \n\n&#8226; Participated in industry and ARRC working groups to ascertain market developments and assess the impact to us and our customers. \n\nCapital Markets \n\nA key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management process around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, potential loss, and sub-limits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee. \n\nMortgage Servicing Rights \n\nWe have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types of inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve. \n\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the MSRs we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our MSRs was $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was $12.9 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nAs with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 71 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTrading Risk \n\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products, as well as underwriting and market making activities. Exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, equity securities, corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments.These securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through CBNA, CCMI, and JMP. \n\nClient facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives, financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure. In addition to the aforementioned activities, we operate trading desks covering secondary loans, corporate bonds, and equity securities; all with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients&#8217; transactions and investor clients. We do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from short-term price differences. \n\nWe record these rate and commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income. Changes in the fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income, a component of noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nMarket Risk Governance \n\nThe market risk limit setting process is established in-line with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy. This appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume. Dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise. A dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business and/or trading desk is permitted to operate, which is reviewed annually at a minimum. Dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile. Primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business. Key risk indicators, including VaR, open foreign currency positions and single name risk, are monitored daily and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts. \n\nMarket Risk Measurement \n\nWe use VaR as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions. Our VaR framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. Risk management VaR is based on a one day holding period to a 99% confidence level, whereas regulatory VaR is based on a ten-day holding period to the same confidence level. In addition to VaR, non-statistical measurements for measuring risk are employed, such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing. \n\nOur market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our &#8220;covered positions&#8221; and allow for aggregation of market risk across products, risk types, business lines and legal entities. We measure, monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 72 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nVaR Overview \n\nThe market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. The VaR measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (General VaR) such as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. It is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period. It is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if required, within this holding period. VaR&#8217;s benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio. Based on the composition of our &#8220;covered positions,&#8221; we also use a standardized add-on approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks&#8217; Specific Risk capital, which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. The General VaR approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. The internal VaR measure (used as the basis of the main VaR trading limits) is a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period, meaning that a loss greater than the VaR is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100 trading days (i.e., 1% of the time). Theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than VaR two to three times per year. The regulatory measure of VaR is done at a 99% confidence level with a ten-day holding period. The historical market data applied to calculate the VaR is updated on a two-business day lag. Refer to &#8220;Market Risk Regulatory Capital&#8221; below for details of our ten-day VaR metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including high, low, average and period end VaR for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, as well as total VaR. \n\nMarket Risk Regulatory Capital \n\nThe U.S. banking regulators&#8217; &#8220;Market Risk Rule&#8221; covers the calculation of market risk capital. Under this rule all our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as &#8220;covered positions.&#8221; The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory VaR. \n\n##TABLE_START Table 29: Results of Modeled and Non-Modeled Measures for Regulatory Capital Calculations (in millions) For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Market Risk Category &#160; \n\nPeriod End Average &#160; \n\nHigh Low Period End Average &#160; \n\nHigh Low Interest Rate $3 $2 $3 $1 $2 $1 $2 $&#8212; Foreign Exchange Currency Rate &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1 2 &#8212; Credit Spread 2 2 2 2 3 7 10 3 Commodity &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; General VaR 5 3 5 2 6 8 10 5 Specific Risk VaR &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total VaR $5 $3 $5 $2 $6 $8 $10 $5 Stressed General VaR $12 $10 $15 $6 $8 $9 $12 $6 Stressed Specific Risk VaR &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Total Stressed VaR $12 $10 $15 $6 $8 $9 $12 $6 Market Risk Regulatory Capital $39 $50 Specific Risk Not Modeled Add-on 20 20 de Minimis Exposure Add-on &#8212; &#8212; Total Market Risk Regulatory Capital $59 $70 Market Risk-Weighted Assets $739 $877 ##TABLE_END\n\nStressed VaR \n\nSVaR is an extension of VaR as it uses a longer historical look-back horizon that is fixed from January 3, 2005. This is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods, but also to provide a counterbalance to VaR, which may be low during periods of low volatility. The holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. In addition to risk management purposes, SVaR is also a component of market risk regulatory capital. We calculate SVaR daily under its own dynamic window regime. In a dynamic window regime values of the ten-day, 99% VaR are calculated over all possible 260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. Refer to &#8220;Market Risk Regulatory Capital&#8221; above for details of SVaR metrics, including high, low, average and period end SVaR for the combined portfolio. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 73 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nSensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange exposures, option prices and credit spreads. Since VaR is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations. \n\nStress Testing \n\nConducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. For historical stress tests, profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns, while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies. Hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold. We generate stress tests of our trading positions daily. For example, we currently include a stress test that simulates a &#8220;Lehman-type&#8221; crisis scenario by taking the worst 20-trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into VaR from that period, and assumes they occurred simultaneously. \n\nVaR Model Review and Validation \n\nMarket risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners. The independent review and validation focuses on model methodology, market data, and performance. Independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of Citizens&#8217; Model Risk Management and Validation team. Aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used, the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them, and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. The quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions is estimated (e.g., through developing alternative models), if possible. Results of such reviews are shared with our banking regulators. The market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior. The Market Risk Management and Validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to market data mapping. \n\nVaR Backtesting \n\nBacktesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a comparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250 business days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception. The level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the VaR and SVaR-based capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes, when applicable. We perform sub-portfolio backtesting as required under the Market Risk Rule, using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange positions. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 74 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal, modeled VaR for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nDaily VaR Backtesting \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 75 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS \n\nFor more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see &#8220;&#8212;Introduction &#8212; Non-GAAP Financial Measures,&#8221; included in this Report.

The Company&#8217;s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is effective. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report appearing on page 85 , which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 80 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of \n\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. \n\nProvidence, Rhode Island \n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 81 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nManagement&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments (collectively the ACL). The ACL is maintained at a level the Company believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments. The determination of the ACL is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors, including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information. \n\nKey assumptions used in the ACL measurement process include the use of a two-year reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a one-year reversion period to historical credit loss information. \n\nThe quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. Known and estimated data include current PD, LGD and EAD (for commercial), timing and amount of expected draws (for unfunded lending commitments), FICO, LTV, term and time on books (for retail loans), mix and level of loan balances, delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, previous loss experience, current business conditions, amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition, business and management performance. Forward-looking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product, unemployment rate, interest rate curve, and changes in collateral values. This data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases, adjusted for expected prepayments. In highly volatile economic environments historical information, such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings, may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models. \n\nThe ACL may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers to reflect current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in the statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates, loan growth, back testing results, credit underwriting policy exceptions, regulatory and audit findings, and peer comparisons. The qualitative allowance is further affected by sensitivity analysis for certain industry sectors or loan classes, including CRE office. \n\nGiven the size of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded commitments and the subjective nature of estimating the ACL, including the estimated impact of the factors noted above and related economic forecasting uncertainty, auditing the ACL involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the ACL for the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded commitments included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of controls over the (i) selection of the foundational economic forecast, (ii) development, execution. and monitoring of the econometric models, (iii) estimation of management&#8217;s adjustments to the modeled reserves in the industry sectors facing challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, (iv) determination of the qualitative allowance, and (v) overall calculation and disclosure of the ACL. \n\n&#8226; With the assistance of credit specialists, we (i) evaluated the reasonableness of the econometric models and related assumptions, (ii) assessed the reasonableness of design, theory, and logic of the econometric models for estimating expected credit losses, (iii) tested the accuracy of the data input into the econometric models, and (iv) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the models&#8217; calculations of the expected credit losses. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 82 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; We (i) evaluated the appropriateness and relevance of the qualitative factors, including management&#8217;s consideration of the economic forecasting uncertainty and adjustments to the modeled reserves for the industry sectors facing challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, (ii) tested the accuracy and evaluated the relevance of the historical loss data used in determining the qualitative allowance, (iii) evaluated the reasonableness of the Company&#8217;s assessment and determination of the qualitative factors and related impact on the estimation of the qualitative allowance and (iv) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the qualitative allowance. \n\n&#8226; We tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the overall ACL and assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures. \n\nInvestors Acquisition &#8211; Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nOn April 6, 2022, Citizens completed its previously announced Investors Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Investors&#8221;) acquisition pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger entered into on July 28, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Investors merged with Citizens, with Citizens as the surviving corporation, and Investors Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Investors, merged with CBNA, with CBNA as the surviving bank. \n\nThe Investors acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Investors were recorded at fair value as of the closing date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. \n\nFair values for loans and leases are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including type of loan and lease and related collateral, fixed or variable interest rate, term, amortization status, credit loss and prepayment expectations, market interest rates and other market factors (e.g., liquidity) from the perspective of a market participant. Loans and leases were grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity. The probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. \n\nFair value of core deposit intangible represents the value of certain client deposit relationships, estimated utilizing the favorable source of funds method. Appropriate consideration was given to deposit costs including servicing costs, client retention and alternative funding source costs at the time of acquisition. The discount rate used was derived taking into account the estimated cost of equity, risk-free return rate and risk premium for the market, and specific risk related to the asset&#8217;s cash flows. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over 10 years using an accelerated depreciation methodology. \n\nWe identified the valuation of the loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset as a critical audit matter because these fair value determinations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists . \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of the acquired loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset as part of the Investors acquisition included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the purchase accounting and policy conclusions reached by management, including Management&#8217;s determination and review of the valuation methodology and relevant assumptions related to the loans and leases and core deposit intangible asset. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 83 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; With the assistance of internal valuation specialists, we (i) evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used and the reasonableness of the valuation and business assumptions used in the valuation, including the selection of discount rates used in the valuation of the loans and leases and the cost of alternative funds used in the valuation of the core deposit intangible asset, and (ii) assessed the mathematical accuracy of the significant valuation calculations. \n\n&#8226; We tested the completeness and accuracy of the source information used in the valuation of the loans and leases and valuation of the core deposit intangible asset. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nBoston, Massachusetts \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2000. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 84 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of \n\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. \n\nProvidence, Rhode Island \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38;

The Company&#8217;s principal business activity is banking, conducted through its subsidiary CBNA. The Company also provides M&#38;A, capital raising and other financial advisory services to middle market companies across a focused set of industry verticals through its broker-dealers. \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citizens and subsidiaries in which Citizens has a controlling financial interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company has evaluated its unconsolidated entities and does not believe that any entity in which it has an interest, but does not currently consolidate, meets the requirements to be consolidated as a variable interest entity. \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the determination of the ACL. \n\nSignificant Accounting Policies \n\nThe following table identifies the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies and the Note and Page where a detailed description of each policy can be found. \n\n##TABLE_START Note Page Cash and Due From Banks 3 \n\nSecurities 4 \n\nLoans and Leases 5 \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses 6 \n\nPremises, Equipment and Software 7 \n\nMortgage Servicing Rights 8 \n\nLeases 9 \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets 10 \n\nVariable Interest Entities 11 \n\nDerivative Instruments 14 \n\nEmployee Benefits 15 \n\nTreasury Stock 17 \n\nEmployee Share-Based Compensation 18 \n\nFair Value Measurement 20 \n\nRevenue Recognition 21 \n\nIncome Taxes 23 \n\nEarnings Per Share 24 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2022 \n\n##TABLE_START Pronouncement Summary of Guidance Effects on Financial Statements \n\nReference Rate Reform - Deferral of the Sunset Date \n\nDecember 2022 \n\n&#8226; This standard was effective upon issuance. \n\n&#8226; Deferred the sunset date of the temporary relief provided by ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. \n\n&#8226; The Company adopted this standard upon issuance. \n\n&#8226; Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 92 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS \n\nAcquisition of HSBC \n\nOn February 18, 2022, CBNA closed on its previously announced HSBC transaction, which included 66 branches in the New York City metropolitan area, 9 branches in the Mid-Atlantic/Washington D.C. area, and 5 branches in Southeast Florida. The acquired liabilities and assets included approximately $ 6.3 billion in deposits and $ 1.5 billion in loans. The transaction resulted in an increase to goodwill of $ 120 million, which was allocated to the Consumer business segment as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe impact of the HSBC transaction, along with supplemental pro forma information as if the HSBC transaction had occurred on January 1, 2021, are not material to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nThe HSBC transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from HSBC were recorded at fair value as of the transaction date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from HSBC were deemed final as of June 30, 2022 and are not material to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nInvestors Acquisition \n\nOn April 6, 2022, Citizens completed its previously announced Investors acquisition pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger entered into on July 28, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Investors merged with Citizens, with Citizens as the surviving corporation, and Investors Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Investors, merged with CBNA, with CBNA as the surviving bank. The Investors acquisition builds Citizens&#8217; physical presence in the Mid-Atlantic region with the addition of 154 branches located in the greater New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and across New Jersey. \n\nUpon closing of the acquisition, each share of Investors common stock was converted into 0.297 of a share of the Company&#8217;s common stock. This conversion, coupled with the conversion of equity awards noted below under &#8220;Share-Based Compensation Activity&#8221;, resulted in an increase of approximately 73.6 million basic and diluted shares. The Company also paid $ 1.46 in cash to shareholders of Investors for each share they owned. \n\nThe Investors acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Investors were recorded at fair value as of the closing date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. Fair value estimates related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Investors are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. \n\nCitizens considers its valuation of certain other assets and other liabilities to be preliminary as of December 31, 2022. While the Company believes the information available as of April 6, 2022 provides a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, additional information may become available that could result in adjustments to the fair values presented, although any such adjustments are not expected to be material. Any adjustments identified during the one year period subsequent to the closing date will be recognized in the corresponding reporting period. \n\nShare-Based Compensation Activity \n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement with Investors, stock options and restricted shares granted by Investors that were outstanding as of April 6, 2022 were converted into CFG awards and remain subject to their original terms and conditions. Citizens issued 1,151,301 stock options and 259,316 restricted shares in connection with the transaction. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 93 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table includes a preliminary allocation of the consideration paid for the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Investors: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except share and per share data) April 6, 2022 Consideration CFG common shares issued 72,148,855 &#160; CFG share price on April 6, 2022 \n\n$ 42.08 &#160; Fair value of consideration for outstanding common stock $ 3,036 &#160; Cash paid 355 &#160; Consideration related to equity awards 19 &#160; Fair value of merger consideration 3,410 &#160; Assets acquired Cash and equivalents 287 &#160; Investment securities 3,826 &#160; Loans held for sale 2,162 &#160; Net loans and leases 20,139 &#160; Premises and equipment 62 &#160; Core deposit intangible and other intangible assets 119 &#160; Other assets 924 &#160; Total assets acquired 27,519 &#160; Liabilities assumed Deposits 20,217 &#160; Borrowed funds 4,097 &#160; Other liabilities 668 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 24,982 &#160; Less: Net assets 2,537 &#160; Goodwill $ 873 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPreliminary goodwill of $ 873 million recorded in connection with the acquisition resulted from the expected synergies, operational efficiencies and expertise of Investors. The amount of goodwill recorded reflects the increased market share and related synergies that are expected to result from the acquisition, and represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired from Investors. The goodwill was allocated to the Company&#8217;s two business operating segments on a preliminary basis and is not deductible for income tax purposes. \n\nIntangible assets from the Investors acquisition consist of core deposits and naming rights. For additional information on these intangibles and goodwill see Note 10. \n\nThe following table includes the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loans acquired from Investors: \n\n##TABLE_START April 6, 2022 (in millions) Unpaid Principal Balance Fair Value Commercial and industrial $ 3,021 &#160; $ 2,899 &#160; Commercial real estate 13,310 &#160; 13,065 &#160; Leases 9 &#160; 9 &#160; Total commercial 16,340 &#160; 15,973 &#160; Residential mortgages 3,949 &#160; 3,889 &#160; Home equity 267 &#160; 273 &#160; Other retail 4 &#160; 4 &#160; Total retail 4,220 &#160; 4,166 &#160; Net loans and leases $ 20,560 &#160; $ 20,139 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 94 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nFair value is estimated as of April 6, 2022 and reflects a credit mark of $ 101 million on PCD funded loans recorded through purchase accounting, and an accretable discount of $ 320 million comprised of $ 179 million in interest rate mark and $ 141 million in non-PCD credit mark. \n\nThe following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair value of significant assets and liabilities: \n\nCash and Equivalents \n\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. \n\nInvestment Securities \n\nFair value estimates for AFS securities were determined by third-party pricing vendors. The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. These methods include the use of quoted prices for an identical or similar security and an alternative market-based or income approach like the discounted cash flow pricing model. Substantially all of the investment securities acquired in connection with the Investors acquisition were sold subsequent to closing to align with Citizens&#8217; portfolio management strategy. \n\nLoans held for sale \n\nLoans held for sale are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. \n\nLoans and Leases \n\nFair values for loans and leases are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including type of loan and lease and related collateral, fixed or variable interest rate, term, amortization status, credit loss and prepayment expectations, market interest rates and other market factors (e.g., liquidity) from the perspective of a market participant. Loans and leases were grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity. The probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. \n\nPremises and Equipment \n\nFair value of premises is based on a market approach using third-party appraisals and broker opinions of value for land, office and branch space. \n\nCore Deposit Intangible \n\nFair value of core deposit intangible represents the value of certain client deposit relationships, estimated utilizing the favorable source of funds method. Appropriate consideration was given to deposit costs including servicing costs, client retention and alternative funding source costs at the time of acquisition. The discount rate used was derived taking into account the estimated cost of equity, risk-free return rate and risk premium for the market, and specific risk related to the asset&#8217;s cash flows. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over 10 years using an accelerated depreciation methodology. \n\nDeposits \n\nFair value of time deposits was estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities. For deposits with no defined maturity, carrying value approximates fair value. \n\nBorrowed Funds \n\nThe fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by using a discounted cash flow methodology based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 95 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the financial results of Investors included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) April 6, 2022 through December 31, 2022 Net interest income $ 627 &#160; Noninterest income 37 &#160; Net income 287 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information as if the Investors acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021 and includes the impact of (i) amortizing and accreting fair value adjustments associated with loans and leases, (ii) the amortization of recognized intangible assets and the elimination of Investors&#8217; historical amortization of these assets, (iii) the elimination of Investors&#8217; historical accretion and amortization of deferred fees and costs on loans and leases, (iv) the elimination of Investors&#8217; historical accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums on loans and leases, debt securities and long-term borrowed funds and (v) the related estimated income tax effects.

Citizens considers a variety of factors in connection with the identification of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality including, but not limited to, nonperforming status, delinquency, risk ratings, TDR classification, FICO scores and other qualitative factors. Citizens initially measures the amortized cost of a PCD loan by adding the acquisition date estimate of expected credit losses to the loan's purchase price. The initial ALLL for PCD loans of $ 101 million was established through an adjustment to the Investors loan balance and related purchase accounting mark. Non-PCD loans and PCD loans had a fair value of $ 15.6 billion and $ 4.5 billion at the acquisition date and unpaid principal balance of $ 15.9 billion and $ 4.7 billion, respectively. In accordance with U.S. GAAP there was no carryover of the ACL that had been previously recorded by Investors. Subsequent to the acquisition, Citizens recorded an ACL on non-PCD loans of $ 145 million through provision expense for credit losses. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 96 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents PCD loan activity at the date of acquisition: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) April 6, 2022 Principal balance $ 4,685 &#160; ALLL at acquisition ( 101 ) Non-credit discount ( 72 ) Purchase price $ 4,512 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAcquisition of DH Capital \n\nOn June 8, 2022, Citizens completed the acquisition of DH Capital, a private investment banking firm serving companies in the internet infrastructure, software, IT services and communications sectors. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with this acquisition were deemed final as of December 31, 2022 and are not material to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe impact of the DH Capital acquisition, along with supplemental pro forma information as if the DH Capital acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021, are not material to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nNOTE 3 - CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS \n\nFor the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less and include cash and due from banks and interest-bearing cash and due from banks. The Company had no material restrictions on the use or availability of its cash as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nNOTE 4 - SECURITIES \n\nInvestments include debt and equity securities and other investment securities. Citizens classifies debt securities as AFS, HTM, or trading based on management&#8217;s intent to hold to maturity at the time of purchase. Management reserves the right to change the initial classification of debt and equity securities purchased based on its intent to hold to maturity or as permitted by periodic changes in accounting guidance. Equity securities are recorded at fair value or at cost if there is not a readily determinable fair value. \n\nDebt securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, or other factors considered in managing the Company&#8217;s asset/liability strategy are classified as AFS and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI, net of taxes, as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity. Gains and losses on the sales of securities are recognized in noninterest income and are computed using the specific identification method. \n\nDebt securities for which the Company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as HTM and reported at amortized cost. Transfers of debt securities to the HTM classification are recognized at fair value at the date of transfer. \n\nFor debt securities classified as AFS or HTM, interest income is recorded on the accrual basis including the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized or accreted using the effective interest method over the estimated lives of the individual securities. Citizens uses actual prepayment experience and estimates of future prepayments to determine the constant effective yield necessary to apply the effective interest method of income recognition. Estimates of future prepayments are based on the underlying collateral characteristics of each security and are derived from market sources. Judgment is involved in making determinations about prepayment expectations and in changing those expectations in response to changes in interest rates and macroeconomic conditions. The amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts associated with mortgage-backed securities may be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment assumptions. \n\nSecurities classified as trading are bought and held principally for selling them in the near-term and carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. When applicable, realized and unrealized gains and losses on such assets are reported in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nEquity securities are primarily composed of FHLB and FRB stock (which are carried at cost) and money market mutual fund investments held by the Company&#8217;s broker-dealers (which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in noninterest income) and are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity securities that are carried at cost are reviewed at least annually for impairment, with valuation adjustments recognized in noninterest income. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 97 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the major components of securities at amortized cost and fair value: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value U.S. Treasury and other $ 3,678 &#160; $ 1 &#160; ($ 193 ) $ 3,486 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11 &#160; State and political subdivisions 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 21,250 &#160; 10 &#160; ( 2,198 ) 19,062 &#160; 24,607 &#160; 210 &#160; ( 375 ) 24,442 &#160; Other/non-agency 280 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 29 ) 251 &#160; 397 &#160; 9 &#160; ( 1 ) 405 &#160; Total mortgage-backed securities 21,530 &#160; 10 &#160; ( 2,227 ) 19,313 &#160; 25,004 &#160; 219 &#160; ( 376 ) 24,847 &#160; Collateralized loan obligations 1,248 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 42 ) 1,206 &#160; 1,208 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) 1,207 &#160; Total debt securities available for sale, at fair value $ 26,458 &#160; $ 11 &#160; ($ 2,462 ) $ 24,007 &#160; $ 26,225 &#160; $ 219 &#160; ($ 377 ) $ 26,067 &#160; Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities $ 9,253 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ($ 751 ) $ 8,506 &#160; $ 1,505 &#160; $ 52 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,557 &#160; Total mortgage-backed securities 9,253 &#160; 4 &#160; ( 751 ) 8,506 &#160; 1,505 &#160; 52 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,557 &#160; Asset-backed securities 581 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 45 ) 536 &#160; 737 &#160; 2 &#160; ( 7 ) 732 &#160; Total debt securities held to maturity $ 9,834 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ($ 796 ) $ 9,042 &#160; $ 2,242 &#160; $ 54 &#160; ($ 7 ) $ 2,289 &#160; Equity securities, at cost $ 1,058 &#160; $&#8212; $&#8212; $ 1,058 &#160; $ 624 &#160; $&#8212; $&#8212; $ 624 &#160; Equity securities, at fair value 153 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 153 &#160; 109 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 109 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAccrued interest receivable on debt securities totaled $ 107 million and $ 56 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 98 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of debt securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2022.

These repurchase agreements are typically short-term in nature and are accounted for as secured borrowed funds in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized no offsetting of short-term receivables or payables as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. The Company offsets certain derivative assets and derivative liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For further information see Note 14. \n\nSecuritizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 143 million and $ 260 million, respectively. These securitizations include a substantive guarantee by a third party. The guarantors were FNMA and FHLMC in 2022 and 2021, and also included GNMA in 2021. The debt securities received from the guarantors are classified as AFS. \n\nImpairment \n\nUpon purchase of HTM investment securities and at each subsequent measurement date, Citizens is required to evaluate the securities for risk of loss over their life and, if necessary, establish an associated reserve. Recognition of a reserve for expected credit losses is not required if the amount the Company expects to realize is zero (commonly referred to as &#8220;zero expected credit losses&#8221;). The Company evaluated its existing HTM portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and concluded that in excess of 94 % of HTM securities met the zero expected credit loss criteria and, therefore, no ACL was recognized. Lifetime expected credit losses on the remainder of the HTM portfolio were determined to be insignificant based on the modeling of the Company&#8217;s credit loss position in the securities. The Company monitors the credit exposure through the use of credit quality indicators. For these securities, the Company uses external credit ratings or an internally derived credit rating when an external rating is not available. All securities were determined to be investment grade at December 31, 2022. \n\nCitizens reviews its AFS debt securities for impairment at the individual security level on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if a potential loss triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of impairment for debt securities classified as AFS is a decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis. For any security that has declined in fair value below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in current period earnings if management has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. \n\nEstimating the recovery of the amortized cost basis of a debt security is based upon an assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security&#8217;s original effective yield, is less than the amortized cost basis, impairment equal to the shortfall in cash flows has occurred. Citizens evaluates whether any portion of the impairment is attributable to credit-related factors or various other market factors affecting the fair value of the security (e.g., interest rates, spread levels, liquidity in the sector, etc.), and the public credit rating of the security. If credit-related factors exist, credit-related impairment has occurred regardless of the Company&#8217;s intent to hold the security until it recovers. \n\nThe credit-related portion of impairment is recognized in current period earnings as provision expense through the establishment of an allowance for AFS securities, to the extent the allowance does not reduce the value of the AFS security below its current fair value. The remaining non-credit related portion of impairment is recognized in OCI. Improvement in credit losses in subsequent periods results in a reversal of the allowance for AFS securities and a corresponding decrease to provision expense, to the extent the allowance does not become negative. Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities is excluded from the balances used to calculate the allowance for AFS securities. All accrued and uncollected interest is immediately reversed against interest income when it is deemed uncollectible. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 100 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following tables present AFS debt securities with fair values below their respective carrying values, separated by the duration the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses US Treasury and other $ 3,356 &#160; ($ 193 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,356 &#160; ($ 193 ) Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 13,353 &#160; ( 1,136 ) 5,042 &#160; ( 1,062 ) 18,395 &#160; ( 2,198 ) Other/non-agency 80 &#160; ( 8 ) 171 &#160; ( 21 ) 251 &#160; ( 29 ) Total mortgage-backed securities 13,433 &#160; ( 1,144 ) 5,213 &#160; ( 1,083 ) 18,646 &#160; ( 2,227 ) Collateralized loan obligations 785 &#160; ( 26 ) 421 &#160; ( 16 ) 1,206 &#160; ( 42 ) Total $ 17,574 &#160; ($ 1,363 ) $ 5,634 &#160; ($ 1,099 ) $ 23,208 &#160; ($ 2,462 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total (in millions) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Mortgage-backed securities: Federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities $ 14,131 &#160; ($ 320 ) $ 1,236 &#160; ($ 55 ) $ 15,367 &#160; ($ 375 ) Other/non-agency 123 &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 123 &#160; ( 1 ) Total mortgage-backed securities 14,254 &#160; ( 321 ) 1,236 &#160; ( 55 ) 15,490 &#160; ( 376 ) Collateralized loan obligations 736 &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 736 &#160; ( 1 ) Total $ 14,990 &#160; ($ 322 ) $ 1,236 &#160; ($ 55 ) $ 16,226 &#160; ($ 377 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nCitizens does not currently have the intent to sell these debt securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases. Citizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the AFS debt securities identified with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022. The unrealized losses on these debt securities reflect non-credit-related factors driven by changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company has determined that these debt securities are not impaired. \n\nNOTE 5 - LOANS AND LEASES \n\nLoans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Management&#8217;s intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies and market conditions. \n\nLoans held for investment are reported at the amount of their outstanding principal, net of charge-offs, unearned income, deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Deferred loan origination fees and costs and purchase premiums and discounts are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan, using the effective interest method. Unamortized amounts remaining upon prepayment or sale are recorded as interest income or gain (loss) on sale, respectively. Credit card receivables include billed and uncollected interest and fees. \n\nInterest income on loans is determined using the effective interest method. This method calculates periodic interest income at a constant effective yield on the net investment in the loan, to provide a constant rate of return over the term. Loans accounted for using the fair value option are measured at fair value with corresponding changes recognized in noninterest income. \n\nLoan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down, and other credit related fees, are deferred (together with any incremental costs) and recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate over the loan term. When it is unlikely that a loan will be drawn down, the loan commitment fees are recognized over the commitment period on a straight-line basis and are reported within letter of credit and loan fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nLoans and leases are disclosed in portfolio segments and classes. The Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio segments are commercial and retail. The classes of loans and leases are: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, leases, residential mortgages, home equity, automobile, education and other retail. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 101 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents loans and leases, excluding LHFS: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Commercial and industrial $ 51,836 &#160; $ 44,500 &#160; Commercial real estate 28,865 &#160; 14,264 &#160; Leases 1,479 &#160; 1,586 &#160; Total commercial 82,180 &#160; 60,350 &#160; Residential mortgages 29,921 &#160; 22,822 &#160; Home equity 14,043 &#160; 12,015 &#160; Automobile 12,292 &#160; 14,549 &#160; Education 12,808 &#160; 12,997 &#160; Other retail 5,418 &#160; 5,430 &#160; Total retail 74,482 &#160; 67,813 &#160; Total loans and leases $ 156,662 &#160; $ 128,163 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAccrued interest receivable on loans and leases held for investment totaled $ 820 million and $ 450 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nLoans pledged as collateral for FHLB borrowing capacity, primarily residential mortgages and home equity products, totaled $ 38.4 billion and $ 26.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

LHFS for which the fair value option is not elected are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value less costs to sell, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Citizens elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS and certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS at fair value. See Note 20 for additional information. \n\nThe following table presents the composition of LHFS: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Residential Mortgages (1) \n\nCommercial (2) \n\nTotal Residential Mortgages (1) \n\nCommercial (2) \n\nTotal Loans held for sale at fair value $ 666 &#160; $ 108 &#160; $ 774 &#160; $ 2,657 &#160; $ 76 &#160; $ 2,733 &#160; Other loans held for sale &#8212; &#160; 208 &#160; 208 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 735 &#160; 735 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Residential mortgage LHFS are originated for sale. \n\n(2) Commercial LHFS at fair value consist of loans managed by the Company&#8217;s commercial secondary loan desk. Other commercial LHFS primarily consist of loans associated with the Company&#8217;s syndication business. \n\nCitizens is engaged in the leasing of equipment for commercial use, primarily focused on middle market and mid-corporate clients for large capital equipment acquisitions including railcars, trucks and trailers, and other equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease and the related lease classification at inception. Lease terms predominantly range from three to ten years and may include options to purchase the leased property prior to the end of the lease term. The Company does not have lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components. \n\nA lessee is evaluated from a credit perspective using the same underwriting standards and procedures as for a loan borrower. A lessee is expected to make rental payments based on its cash flows and the viability of its operations. Leases are usually not evaluated as collateral-based transactions, and therefore the lessee&#8217;s overall financial strength is the most important credit evaluation factor. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 102 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe components of the net investment in direct financing and sales-type leases, before ALLL, are presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total future minimum lease rentals $ 1,193 &#160; $ 1,195 &#160; Estimated residual value of leased equipment (non-guaranteed) 413 &#160; 521 &#160; Initial direct costs 5 &#160; 6 &#160; Unearned income ( 132 ) ( 136 ) Total leases $ 1,479 &#160; $ 1,586 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest income on direct financing and sales-type leases for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 46 million, $ 49 million and $ 64 million, respectively, and is reported within interest and fees on loans and leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nA maturity analysis of direct financing and sales-type lease receivables at December 31, 2022 is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2023 $ 334 &#160; 2024 247 &#160; 2025 193 &#160; 2026 144 &#160; 2027 122 &#160; Thereafter 153 &#160; Total undiscounted future minimum lease rentals $ 1,193 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 6 - ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, NONACCRUAL LOANS AND LEASES, AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses &#160; \n\nManagement&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments (collectively the ACL). The ACL is maintained at a level the Company believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments. The determination of the ACL is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors, including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information. Upon adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020, the Company&#8217;s ACL reserve methodology changed to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans and leases, resulting in a cumulative-effect reduction of $ 337 million, net of taxes of $ 114 million, to retained earnings and a corresponding increase to the ACL of $ 451 million. \n\nKey assumptions used in the ACL measurement process include the use of a two-year reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a one-year reversion period to historical credit loss information. \n\nThe evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group. Loans are grouped generally by product type (e.g., commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage), and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using econometric models. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 103 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation, and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. Known and estimated data include current PD, LGD and EAD (for commercial), timing and amount of expected draws (for unfunded lending commitments), FICO, LTV, term and time on books (for retail loans), mix and level of loan balances, delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings, previous loss experience, current business conditions, amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition, business and management performance. Forward-looking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product, unemployment rate, interest rate curve, and changes in collateral values. This data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases, adjusted for expected prepayments. In highly volatile economic environments historical information, such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings, may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models. \n\nThe ACL may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers to reflect current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in the statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates, loan growth, back testing results, credit underwriting policy exceptions, regulatory and audit findings, and peer comparisons. The qualitative allowance is further affected by sensitivity analysis for certain industry sectors or loan classes, including CRE office. \n\nThe measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments, and qualitative allowances that are judgmentally determined and applied across the portfolio. \n\nThere are certain loan portfolios that may not need an econometric model to enable the Company to calculate management&#8217;s best estimate of the expected credit losses. Less data intensive, non-modeled approaches to estimating losses are considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have lower levels of outstanding balances (e.g., runoff or closed portfolios, new products or products that are not significant to the Company&#8217;s overall credit risk exposure). \n\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually assessed for expected credit losses. Nonaccrual commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of $ 5 million or greater and all commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate TDRs (regardless of size) are assessed on an individual loan level basis. Generally, the measurement of ACL on individual loans and leases is the present value of its future cash flows or the fair value of its underlying collateral, if the loan or lease is collateral dependent. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower&#8217;s operations, income or other resources. Loans that are deemed to be collateral dependent are written down to the fair value, less costs to sell, as of the evaluation date and are reassessed each subsequent period to determine if a change to the ACL is required. Subsequent evaluations may result in an increase or decrease to the ACL, based on a corresponding change in the fair value of the collateral during the period. Any subsequent decrease to the ACL (because of an increase to the collateral-dependent loan&#8217;s fair value) is limited to the total amount previously written off for that loan. For retail TDRs that are not collateral dependent, the ACL is developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the amortized cost basis in the loans. Expected re-default factors are considered in this analysis. Retail TDRs that are deemed collateral dependent are written down to fair market value less cost to sell. \n\nExpected recoveries are considered in management&#8217;s estimate of the ACL and may result in a negative adjustment (i.e., reduction) to the ACL balance. A loan is collateral dependent if repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the evaluation date. Generally, repayment would be expected to be provided substantially by the sale or continued operation of the underlying collateral if cash flows to repay the loan from all other available sources (including guarantors) are expected to be no more than nominal. If repayment is dependent only on the operation of the collateral, the fair value of the collateral would not be adjusted for estimated costs to sell. If a loan is considered collateral dependent, the ACL is calculated as the difference between the fair value of collateral (adjusted for the costs to sell if the sale of the collateral is expected) and the amortized cost basis as of the evaluation date. It is possible to have a negative ACL for a collateral dependent loan if the fair value of the collateral increases in a subsequent reporting period. The negative ACL cannot exceed the total amount previously charged off. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 104 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAccrued interest receivable on loans and leases is excluded from asset balances used to calculate the ACL. All accrued and uncollected interest is immediately reversed against interest income when a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status. Uncollectible interest is written off timely in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Generally, loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more, or earlier if management believes that the probability of collection is insufficient to warrant further accrual. Residential mortgages are placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 120 days or more, or sooner if deemed collateral dependent, unless guaranteed by the FHA, VA or USDA. Residential mortgages that received extended forbearance and were subsequently modified as a result of COVID-19 will be placed on nonaccrual sooner than those that were not on extended forbearance, and will return to accrual status only following a sustained period of repayment performance. \n\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. Off-balance sheet financial instruments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the Company&#8217;s internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with historical loss experience, current and future economic conditions, timing and amount of expected draws, and performance trends within specific portfolio segments, result in the estimate of the allowance for unfunded lending commitments. The Company does not recognize a reserve for future draws from credit lines that are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards). \n\nThe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the allowance for loan and lease losses and in other liabilities, respectively. Provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and the unfunded lending commitments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as provision for credit losses. \n\nLoan Charge-Offs \n\nCommercial loans are charged off when available information indicates that a loan or portion thereof is determined to be uncollectible. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off involves many factors, including the prioritization of the Company&#8217;s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower&#8217;s equity or the loan collateral. \n\nRetail loans are generally fully charged-off or written down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, with an offset to the ALLL, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, credit card loans and unsecured open-end loans are generally charged off in the month when the account becomes 180 days past due. Auto loans, education loans and unsecured closed end loans are generally charged off in the month when the account becomes 120 days past due. Certain retail loans will be charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances: \n\n&#8226; Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent. \n\n&#8226; Residential real estate loans that received extended forbearance and were subsequently modified as a result of COVID-19 \n\n&#8226; Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event (e.g., bankruptcy) that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain. \n\n&#9702; Residential real estate and auto loans are charged down to fair value less costs to sell within 60 days of receiving notification of the bankruptcy filing, unless repayment is likely to occur, or when the loan subsequently becomes 60 days past due. \n\n&#9702; Credit card loans are fully charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of the bankruptcy filing or other event. \n\n&#9702; Education loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes 60 days past due after receiving notification of a bankruptcy. \n\n&#8226; Auto loans are written down to fair value less costs to sell upon repossession of the collateral. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 105 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the ACL for the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 (in millions) Commercial Retail Total Allowance for loan and lease losses, beginning of period $ 821 &#160; $ 937 &#160; $ 1,758 &#160; Allowance on PCD loans and leases at acquisition 99 &#160; 2 &#160; 101 &#160; Charge-offs (1) \n\n( 70 ) ( 364 ) ( 434 ) Recoveries 18 &#160; 146 &#160; 164 &#160; Net charge-offs ( 52 ) ( 218 ) ( 270 ) \n\nProvision expense (benefit) for loans and leases (2) \n\n192 &#160; 202 &#160; 394 &#160; Allowance for loan and lease losses, end of period 1,060 &#160; 923 &#160; 1,983 &#160; Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, beginning of period 153 &#160; 23 &#160; 176 &#160; Provision expense (benefit) for unfunded lending commitments 53 &#160; 27 &#160; 80 &#160; Allowance on PCD unfunded lending commitments at acquisition 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Allowance for unfunded lending commitments, end of period 207 &#160; 50 &#160; 257 &#160; Total allowance for credit losses, end of period $ 1,267 &#160; $ 973 &#160; $ 2,240 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes $ 34 million of charge-offs previously taken by Investors or recognized upon completion of the Investors acquisition under purchase accounting for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Citizens defines the vintage date for the purpose of this disclosure as the date of the most recent credit decision. In general, renewals are categorized as new credit decisions and reflect the renewal date as the vintage date. Loans modified in a TDR are considered a continuation of the original loan and vintage date corresponds with the most recent credit decision. \n\nFor commercial loans and leases, Citizens utilizes regulatory classification ratings to monitor credit quality. The assignment of regulatory classification ratings occurs at loan origination and are periodically re-evaluated by Citizens utilizing a risk-based approach, including any time management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers' ability to fulfill their obligations. The review process considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Loans with a &#8220;pass&#8221; rating are those that the Company believes will fully repay in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Commercial loans and leases identified as &#8220;criticized&#8221; have some weakness or potential weakness that indicate an increased probability of future loss. Citizens groups &#8220;criticized&#8221; loans into three categories, &#8220;special mention,&#8221; &#8220;substandard,&#8221; and &#8220;doubtful.&#8221; Special mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the Company&#8217;s credit position at some future date. Substandard loans are inadequately protected loans; these loans have well-defined weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. Doubtful loans have the same weaknesses as substandard, with the added characteristic that the possibility of loss is high and collection of the full amount of the loan is improbable. Additional credit quality information is discussed below for each loan class. \n\nFor commercial and industrial loans, Citizens monitors the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, management assigns an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower&#8217;s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process. These ratings are generally reviewed at least annually. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to commercial and industrial loans, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss severity in the event of default, reflects credit quality characteristics as of the reporting date and are used as inputs into the loss forecasting process. Based upon the amount of the lending arrangement and risk rating assessment, management periodically reviews each loan, prioritizing those loans which are perceived to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is weakening (e.g., payment delinquency). Citizens proactively manages loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach to the borrower, assessment of the borrower&#8217;s financial conditions and appraisal of the collateral. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 107 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCredit risk associated with commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgages are managed similar to commercial and industrial loans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with commercial real estate activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. As with the commercial and industrial loan class, periodic reviews are also performed to assess market/geographic risk and business unit/industry risk, which may result in increased scrutiny on loans that are perceived to be of higher risk, had adverse changes in risk ratings and/or areas that concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and facilitate actions to mitigate such risks. \n\nCitizens manages credit risk associated with financing leases similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Reviews are generally performed annually based upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of credit risk, and may be more frequent if circumstances warrant. The review process includes analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance as applicable. \n\nCommercial loans with renewal terms in the original contract are recognized as current year originations upon renewal unless the loan automatically renewed with no new credit decision. Citizens generally reserves the right to not renew the loan or lease until current underwriting has been completed and approved. \n\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of commercial loans and leases, by vintage date and regulatory classification rating, as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Term Loans by Origination Year Revolving Loans (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior to 2018 Within the Revolving Period Converted to Term Total Commercial and industrial Pass $ 8,304 &#160;

Loans (other than certain retail loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is in doubt, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. \n\nWhen the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status, the accrued unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income and amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. Interest collections on nonaccrual loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are generally applied to first reduce the carrying value of the asset. Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent of the cash received. A loan or lease may be returned to accrual status if: \n\n&#8226; principal and interest payments have been brought current, and the Company expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest; \n\n&#8226; the loan or lease has otherwise become well-secured and in the process of collection; or \n\n&#8226; the borrower has been making regularly scheduled payments in full for the prior six months and the Company is reasonably assured that the loan or lease will be brought fully current within a reasonable period. \n\nCommercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and leases are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more, or earlier if management believes that the probability of collection is insufficient to warrant further accrual. Some of these loans and leases may remain on accrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more if management considers the loan collectible. \n\nResidential mortgages are generally placed on nonaccrual status when past due 120 days, or sooner if determined to be collateral dependent, unless repayment of the loan is fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA or USDA. Credit card balances are placed on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days or more and are restored to accruing status if they subsequently become less than 90 days past due. All other retail loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days or more, or earlier if management believes that the probability of collection is insufficient to warrant further accrual. Loans less than 90 days past due may be placed on nonaccrual status upon the death of the borrower, fraud or bankruptcy. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 112 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following tables present an aging analysis of accruing loans and leases, and nonaccrual loans and leases as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 Days Past Due and Accruing (in millions) Current 30-59 60-89 90+ Nonaccrual Total Nonaccrual with no related ACL Commercial and industrial $ 51,389 &#160; $ 152 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 21 &#160; $ 249 &#160; $ 51,836 &#160; $ 64 &#160; Commercial real estate 28,665 &#160; 51 &#160; 45 &#160; 1 &#160; 103 &#160; 28,865 &#160; 7 &#160; Leases 1,475 &#160; 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,479 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total commercial 81,529 &#160; 207 &#160; 70 &#160; 22 &#160; 352 &#160; 82,180 &#160; 71 &#160; \n\nResidential mortgages (1) \n\n29,228 &#160; 95 &#160; 45 &#160; 319 &#160; 234 &#160; 29,921 &#160; 187 &#160; Home equity 13,719 &#160; 64 &#160; 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 241 &#160; 14,043 &#160; 185 &#160; Automobile 12,039 &#160; 152 &#160; 45 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 56 &#160; 12,292 &#160; 9 &#160; Education 12,718 &#160; 36 &#160; 17 &#160; 4 &#160; 33 &#160; 12,808 &#160; 3 &#160; Other retail 5,294 &#160; 44 &#160; 30 &#160; 22 &#160; 28 &#160; 5,418 &#160; 1 &#160; Total retail 72,998 &#160; 391 &#160; 156 &#160; 345 &#160; 592 &#160; 74,482 &#160; 385 &#160; Total $ 154,527 &#160; $ 598 &#160; $ 226 &#160; $ 367 &#160; $ 944 &#160; $ 156,662 &#160; $ 456 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 Days Past Due and Accruing (in millions) Current 30-59 60-89 90+ Nonaccrual Total Nonaccrual with no related ACL Commercial and industrial $ 44,247 &#160; $ 47 &#160; $ 26 &#160; $ 9 &#160; $ 171 &#160; $ 44,500 &#160; $ 36 &#160; Commercial real estate 14,247 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11 &#160; 14,264 &#160; 1 &#160; Leases 1,570 &#160; 14 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1,586 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total commercial 60,064 &#160; 67 &#160; 27 &#160; 9 &#160; 183 &#160; 60,350 &#160; 37 &#160; \n\nResidential mortgages (1) \n\n21,918 &#160; 102 &#160; 52 &#160; 549 &#160; 201 &#160; 22,822 &#160; 137 &#160; Home equity 11,745 &#160; 38 &#160; 12 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 220 &#160; 12,015 &#160; 186 &#160; Automobile 14,324 &#160; 131 &#160; 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 55 &#160; 14,549 &#160; 22 &#160; Education 12,926 &#160; 34 &#160; 13 &#160; 1 &#160; 23 &#160; 12,997 &#160; 2 &#160; Other retail 5,331 &#160; 40 &#160; 23 &#160; 16 &#160; 20 &#160; 5,430 &#160; 2 &#160; Total retail 66,244 &#160; 345 &#160; 139 &#160; 566 &#160; 519 &#160; 67,813 &#160; 349 &#160; Total $ 126,308 &#160; $ 412 &#160; $ 166 &#160; $ 575 &#160; $ 702 &#160; $ 128,163 &#160; $ 386 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) 90+ days past due and accruing includes $ 316 million and $ 544 million of loans fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA and USDA at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nInterest income is generally not recognized for loans and leases that are on nonaccrual status. The Company reverses accrued interest receivable with a charge to interest income upon classifying a loan or lease as nonaccrual. \n\nCertain commercial and consumer loans are considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the loan collateral. Collateral values for residential mortgage and home equity loans are based on refreshed valuations, which are updated at least every 90 days, less estimated costs to sell. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had collateral-dependent residential mortgage and home equity loans totaling $ 561 million and $ 542 million, respectively. \n\nFor collateral-dependent commercial loans, the ACL is individually assessed based on the fair value of the collateral. Various types of collateral are used, including real estate, inventory, equipment, accounts receivable, securities and cash, among others. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals which are updated based on management judgment under the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had collateral-dependent commercial loans totaling $ 21 million and $ 103 million, respectively. \n\nThe amortized cost basis of mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in-process was $ 250 million and $ 142 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 113 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings \n\nIn situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. TDRs typically result from the Company&#8217;s loss mitigation efforts and are undertaken in order to improve the likelihood of recovery and continuity of the relationship with the borrower. The Company&#8217;s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower&#8217;s financial needs. Concessions granted in TDRs for all classes of loans may include lowering the interest rate, forgiving a portion of principal, extending the loan term, lowering scheduled payments for a specified period of time, waiving or delaying a scheduled payment of principal or interest for other than an insignificant time period, or capitalizing past due amounts. A rate increase can be a concession if the increased rate is lower than a market rate for debt with risk similar to that of the restructured loan. TDRs for commercial loans may also involve creating a multiple note structure, accepting non-cash assets, accepting an equity interest, or receiving a performance-based fee. In some cases, a TDR may involve multiple concessions. The financial effects of TDRs for all loan classes may include lower income (either due to a lower interest rate or a delay in the timing of cash flows), larger loan loss provisions, and accelerated charge-offs if the modification renders the loan collateral-dependent. In some cases, interest income throughout the term of the loan may increase if, for example, the loan is extended or the interest rate is increased as a result of the restructuring. \n\nRetail and commercial loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Retail loans that were discharged in bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower are deemed to be collateral-dependent TDRs and are generally charged off to the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, and less amounts recoverable under a government guarantee (if any). Cash receipts on nonaccrual impaired loans, including nonaccrual loans involved in TDRs, are generally applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance. Certain TDRs that are current in payment status are classified as nonaccrual in accordance with regulatory guidance. Income on these loans may be recognized on a cash basis if management believes that the remaining book value of the loan is realizable. Nonaccrual TDRs that meet the guidelines above for accrual status can be returned to accruing if supported by a well-documented evaluation of the borrowers&#8217; financial condition, and if they have been current for at least six months. \n\nBecause TDRs are impaired loans, Citizens measures impairment by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows, or when appropriate, the fair value of collateral less costs to sell, to the loan&#8217;s amortized cost basis. Any excess of amortized cost basis over the present value of expected future cash flows or collateral value is included in the ALLL. Any portion of the loan&#8217;s amortized cost basis the Company does not expect to collect as a result of the modification is charged off at the time of modification. For retail TDR accounts where the expected value of cash flows is utilized, any recorded investment in excess of the present value of expected cash flows is recognized by increasing the ALLL. For retail TDR accounts assessed based on the fair value of collateral, any portion of the loan&#8217;s recorded investment in excess of the collateral value less costs to sell is charged off at the time of modification or at the time of subsequent and regularly recurring valuations. \n\nIn 2020, Citizens implemented various retail and commercial loan modification programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. The CARES Act and bank regulatory agencies provided guidance stating certain loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of COVID-19 may not be accounted for as TDRs under U.S. GAAP. In accordance with the CARES Act, Citizens elected to not apply TDR classification to any COVID-19-related loan modification performed after March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 for borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019 or the date of their loan modification. In addition, for loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns that were not eligible for relief from TDR classification under the CARES Act, the Company elected to apply the guidance issued by the bank regulatory agencies. Under this guidance, loans with up to six months of deferred principal and interest to borrowers who were current as of March 1, 2020 or the date of their loan modification are not classified as TDRs. \n\nFor loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrower&#8217;s past due and nonaccrual status will not be impacted during the deferral period.

Generally, loans are collateralized by assets including real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, other personal property and investment securities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Citizens had a significant amount of loans collateralized by residential and commercial real estate. There were no significant concentration risks within the commercial or retail loan portfolios. Exposure to credit losses arising from lending transactions may fluctuate with fair values of collateral supporting loans, which may not perform according to contractual agreements. The Company&#8217;s policy is to collateralize loans to the extent necessary; however, unsecured loans are also granted on the basis of the financial strength of the applicant and the facts surrounding the transaction. \n\nNOTE 7 - PREMISES, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE \n\nPremises and Equipment \n\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease (including renewal options if exercise of those options is reasonably assured) or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. \n\nAdditions to premises and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of major additions, improvements and betterments is capitalized. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend the useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Citizens evaluates premises and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. \n\nA summary of the carrying value of premises and equipment is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (dollars in millions) Useful Lives (years) 2022 2021 Land and land improvements 10 - 75 \n\n$ 144 &#160; $ 101 &#160; Buildings and leasehold improvements 5 - 60 \n\n879 &#160; 805 &#160; Furniture, fixtures and equipment 4 - 20 \n\n622 &#160; 589 &#160; Construction in progress 61 &#160; 77 &#160; Total premises and equipment, gross 1,706 &#160; 1,572 &#160; Accumulated depreciation ( 862 ) ( 804 ) Total premises and equipment, net $ 844 &#160; $ 768 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDepreciation charged to noninterest expense totaled $ 107 million, $ 98 million and $ 110 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in either occupancy or equipment expense, as applicable. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 116 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSoftware \n\nCosts related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if the projects improve functionality and provide long-term future operational benefits. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the asset&#8217;s expected useful life, based upon the basic pattern of consumption and economic benefits provided by the asset. Citizens begins to amortize the software when the asset (or identifiable component of the asset) is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. All other costs incurred in connection with an internal-use software project are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nCitizens had capitalized software assets of $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.3 billion and related accumulated amortization of $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense was $ 243 million, $ 235 million and $ 215 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe estimated future amortization expense for capitalized software assets is presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START Year (in millions) 2023 $ 226 &#160; 2024 199 &#160; 2025 158 &#160; 2026 90 &#160; 2027 33 &#160; Thereafter 7 &#160; \n\nTotal (1) \n\n$ 713 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excluded from this balance is $ 174 million of in-process software at December 31, 2022. \n\nNOTE 8 - MORTGAGE BANKING AND OTHER SERVICED LOANS \n\nThe Company sells residential mortgages into the secondary market. The Company retains no beneficial interest in these sales, but may retain the servicing rights for the loans sold. The Company may exercise its option to repurchase eligible government guaranteed residential mortgages or may be obligated to subsequently repurchase a loan if the purchaser discovers a representation or warranty violation such as noncompliance with eligibility or servicing requirements, or customer fraud that should have been identified in a loan file review. \n\nMortgage loans held for sale are accounted for at fair value on an individual loan basis. Changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of mortgage loans, are reported in mortgage banking fees. \n\nThe following table summarizes activity related to residential mortgage loans sold with servicing rights retained: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash proceeds from residential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained $ 17,025 &#160; $ 37,039 &#160; $ 33,221 &#160; \n\nRepurchased residential mortgages (1) \n\n87 &#160; 1,381 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nGain on sales (2) \n\n86 &#160; 382 &#160; 895 &#160; \n\nContractually specified servicing, late and other ancillary fees (2) \n\n287 &#160; 247 &#160; 227 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes government insured or guaranteed loans repurchased through the exercise of the Company&#8217;s removal of account provision option. \n\n(2) Reported in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nThe Company recognizes the right to service residential mortgage loans for others, or MSRs, as separate assets, which are presented in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, when purchased, or when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale with servicing rights retained. All MSRs are measured using the fair value method, with any change in fair value during the period recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans related to our MSRs was $ 96.7 billion and $ 90.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company manages the risk associated with changes in the value of MSRs with an active hedging strategy, which includes the purchase of freestanding derivatives. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 117 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in MSRs recorded using the fair value method: \n\n##TABLE_START As of and for the Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Fair value as of beginning of the period $ 1,029 &#160; $ 658 &#160; Amounts capitalized 279 &#160; 419 &#160; Servicing rights acquired (1) \n\n16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Changes in unpaid principal balance during the period (2) \n\n( 137 ) ( 212 ) Changes in fair value during the period (3) \n\n343 &#160; 164 &#160; Fair value at end of the period $ 1,530 &#160; $ 1,029 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents MSRs acquired as part of the Investors acquisition. \n\n(2) Represents changes in value of the MSRs due to i) passage of time including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and partial paydowns, and ii) loans that paid off during the period. \n\n(3) Represents changes in value primarily driven by market conditions. These changes are recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nThe fair value of MSRs is estimated by using the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, contractual servicing fee income, servicing costs, default rates, ancillary income, and other economic factors, which are determined based on current market interest rates. The valuation does not attempt to forecast or predict the future direction of interest rates. \n\nThe sensitivity analysis below presents the impact of an immediate 10% and 20% adverse change in key economic assumptions to the current fair value of MSRs. These sensitivities are hypothetical, with the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rates, could result in changes in the discount rates), which may amplify or counteract the sensitivities. The primary risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s MSRs is an increase in prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans serviced, which is largely dependent upon movements in market interest rates. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fair value $ 1,530 $ 1,029 Weighted average life (years) 9.1 6.4 Weighted average constant prepayment rate 6.8 % 10.7 % Decline in fair value from 10 % adverse change \n\n$ 34 $ 45 Decline in fair value from 20 % adverse change \n\n$ 66 $ 87 Weighted average option adjusted spread 629 bps 596 bps Decline in fair value from 10 % adverse change \n\n$ 43 $ 25 Decline in fair value from 20 % adverse change \n\n$ 86 $ 50 ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s mortgage banking derivatives include commitments to originate mortgages held for sale, certain loan sale agreements, and other financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative. Refer to Note 14 for additional information. \n\nOther Serviced Loans \n\nFrom time to time, Citizens engages in other servicing relationships. The following table presents the unpaid principal balance of other serviced loans: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Education $ 602 &#160; $ 761 &#160; \n\nCommercial and industrial (1) \n\n91 &#160; 80 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents the government guaranteed portion of SBA loans sold to outside investors. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 118 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 9 - LEASES \n\nCitizens as Lessee \n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and records a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. A right-of-use asset represents the value of the Company&#8217;s contractual right to use an underlying leased asset and a lease liability represents the Company&#8217;s contractual obligation to make payments on the same underlying leased asset. Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the non-cancelable lease term. As most of the Company&#8217;s leases do not specify an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company evaluates right-of-use assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company leases both equipment and real estate, including office and branch space. Lease terms predominantly range from one year to ten years and may include options to extend the lease, terminate the lease, or purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease. Certain lease agreements include rental payments based on an index or are adjusted periodically for inflation. The Company has lease agreements that contain lease and non-lease components and for certain real estate leases, these components are accounted for as a single lease component. \n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in occupancy expense in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. The Company may also enter into subleases with third parties for certain leased real estate properties that are no longer occupied. \n\nThe components of operating lease cost are presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 216 &#160; $ 161 &#160; $ 165 &#160; Short-term lease cost 2 &#160; 1 &#160; 4 &#160; Variable lease cost 7 &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; Sublease income ( 1 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Total $ 224 &#160; $ 166 &#160; $ 173 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy, equipment and software expense, and other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nSupplemental information related to the Company&#8217;s operating lease arrangements is presented in the tables below: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Affected Line Item in Consolidated Balance Sheets Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 1,019 &#160; $ 766 &#160; Other assets Operating lease liabilities 1,066 &#160; 800 &#160; Other liabilities Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 7 7 &#8212; Weighted average discount rate 2.74 &#160; % 2.34 &#160; % &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in measurement of liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 219 &#160; $ 163 &#160; $ 167 &#160; Supplemental non-cash information on lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets: Right-of-use assets in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 408 &#160; 79 &#160; 268 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 119 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, lease liabilities maturing under non-cancelable operating leases are presented below for the years ended December 31. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Operating Leases 2023 $ 207 &#160; 2024 206 &#160; 2025 178 &#160; 2026 142 &#160; 2027 123 &#160; Thereafter 324 &#160; Total lease payments 1,180 &#160; Less: Interest 114 &#160; Present value of lease liabilities $ 1,066 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCitizens as Lessor \n\nOperating lease assets where Citizens was the lessor totaled $ 260 million and $ 244 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operating lease rental income for leased assets where Citizens is the lessor is recognized in other income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nDepreciation expense associated with operating lease assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, considering the estimated residual value of the leased asset and is included in other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. On a periodic basis, operating lease assets are reviewed for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized in other operating expense if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. The carrying amount of a leased asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon the eventual disposition of the asset. \n\nFor a discussion of direct finance and sales-type leases where Citizens is the lessor, refer to Note 5. \n\nNOTE 10 - GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nGoodwill is the purchase premium associated with the acquisition of a business and is assigned to the Company&#8217;s reporting units at the acquisition date. A reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment. Citizens has identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units - Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking - based upon reviews of the structure of the Company&#8217;s executive team and supporting functions, resource allocations and financial reporting processes. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the value of the goodwill. \n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Citizens reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of October 31 st and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value of one or more reporting units may not be recoverable. The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is necessary; otherwise, Citizens must perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill. \n\nCitizens may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit&#8217;s fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value inclusive of goodwill, applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit inclusive of goodwill exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. The impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 120 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nUnder the quantitative impairment assessment, the fair values of the Company&#8217;s reporting units are determined using a combination of income and market-based approaches. Citizens relies on the income approach (discounted cash flow method) for determining fair value. Market and transaction approaches are used as benchmarks to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method. Citizens relies on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow method. These assumptions include the discount rate, projected loan losses, income tax and capital retention rates. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Citizens performed a quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of either of its reporting units was less than the respective reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value. Multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, customer retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit is based on management&#8217;s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as GDP and inflation. As a result of this quantitative assessment, the Company determined that there was no impairment to the carrying value of the Company's goodwill as of December 31, 2022. \n\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Total Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 2,258 &#160; $ 4,792 &#160; $ 7,050 &#160; Business acquisitions &#8212; &#160; 66 &#160; 66 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 2,258 &#160; $ 4,858 &#160; $ 7,116 &#160; Business acquisitions 415 &#160; 642 &#160; 1,057 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 2,673 &#160; $ 5,500 &#160; $ 8,173 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of the Investors and DH Capital acquisitions and the HSBC transaction. Goodwill for the Investors acquisition was allocated between the Consumer and Commercial segments and is preliminary and subject to change. Goodwill for the HSBC transaction was allocated to the Consumer segment, and goodwill for the DH Capital acquisition was allocated to the Commercial segment; both of which are considered final. For additional information regarding the Investors and DH Capital acquisitions and the HSBC transaction see Note 2. \n\nAccumulated impairment losses related to the Consumer Banking reporting unit totaled $ 5.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The accumulated impairment losses related to the Commercial Banking reporting unit totaled $ 50 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\nOther Intangibles \n\nOther intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if the asset arises as a result of contractual rights or if the asset is capable of being separated and sold, transferred or exchanged. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis with the exception of core deposits, which are amortized using an accelerated methodology, and are subject to an annual impairment evaluation. Amortization expense is recorded in other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nA summary of the carrying value of intangible assets is presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Amortizable Lives (years) Gross (1) \n\nAccumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Core deposits 10 \n\n$ 144 &#160; $ 20 &#160; $ 124 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Acquired technology 5 - 7 \n\n23 &#160; 19 &#160; 4 &#160; 21 &#160; 11 &#160; 10 &#160; Acquired relationships 2 - 15 \n\n54 &#160; 21 &#160; 33 &#160; 53 &#160; 14 &#160; 39 &#160; Naming Rights 5 - 10 \n\n33 &#160; 7 &#160; 26 &#160; 10 &#160; 3 &#160; 7 &#160; Other 2 - 7 \n\n17 &#160; 7 &#160; 10 &#160; 13 &#160; 5 &#160; 8 &#160; Total $ 271 &#160; $ 74 &#160; $ 197 &#160; $ 97 &#160; $ 33 &#160; $ 64 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes $ 97 million and $ 47 million of core deposits from the Investors acquisition and the HSBC transaction, respectively, and $ 24 million of naming rights from the Investors acquisition. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 121 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all of the Company&#8217;s intangible assets were being amortized. Amortization expense recognized on intangible assets was $ 41 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 11 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company&#8217;s projection of amortization expense is based on balances as of December 31, 2022, including estimated amounts related to the Investors acquisition. Future amortization expense may vary from these projections. \n\nEstimated intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total 2023 $ 41 &#160; 2024 34 &#160; 2025 31 &#160; 2026 28 &#160; 2027 24 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 11 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \n\nCitizens makes equity investments in various entities that are considered VIEs, as defined by GAAP. A VIE typically does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The Company&#8217;s variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity's net assets. Citizens consolidates a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. Citizens is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if its variable interest provides it with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and the right to receive benefits (or the obligation to absorb losses) that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest held could potentially be significant to the VIE, the company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE. Citizens assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \n\nCitizens is involved in various entities that are considered VIEs, including investments in limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects, limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects or asset-backed securities, and lending to special purpose entities. Citizens&#8217; maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these entities is limited to the balance sheet carrying amount of its investment in equity and asset-backed securities, unfunded commitments, and outstanding principal balance of loans to special purpose entities. \n\nA summary of these investments is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Lending to special purpose entities included in loans and leases $ 4,578 &#160; $ 2,646 &#160; LIHTC investment included in other assets 2,230 &#160; 1,978 &#160; LIHTC unfunded commitments included in other liabilities 1,046 &#160; 927 &#160; Asset-backed investments included in HTM securities 581 &#160; 737 &#160; Renewable energy investments included in other assets 374 &#160; 429 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nLending to Special Purpose Entities \n\nCitizens provides lending facilities to third-party sponsored special purpose entities. Because the sponsor for each respective entity has the power to direct how proceeds from the Company are utilized, as well as maintains responsibility for any associated servicing commitments, Citizens is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the lending facilities had aggregate unpaid principal balances of $ 4.6 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively, and undrawn commitments to extend credit of $ 2.4 billion and $ 1.9 billion, respectively. For more information on commitments to extend credit see Note 19. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 122 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLow Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships \n\nThe purpose of the Company&#8217;s equity investments is to assist in achieving the goals of the CRA and to earn an adequate return of capital. LIHTC partnerships are managed by unrelated general partners that have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the partnerships and, therefore, Citizens is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs. \n\nCitizens applies the proportional amortization method to account for its LIHTC investments. Under the proportional amortization method, the Company applies a practical expedient and amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits received in the current period as compared to the total tax credits expected to be received over the life of the investment. The amortization and tax benefits are included as a component of income tax expense. The tax credits received related to these transactions are reported as a reduction of income tax expense (or an increase to income tax benefit). \n\nThe following table presents information related to the Company&#8217;s affordable housing tax credit investments: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Tax credits included in income tax expense $ 236 &#160; $ 202 &#160; $ 159 &#160; Other tax benefits included in income tax expense 59 &#160; 48 &#160; 38 &#160; Total tax benefits included in income tax expense 295 &#160; 250 &#160; 197 &#160; Less: Amortization included in income tax expense 247 &#160; 208 &#160; 168 &#160; Net benefit from affordable housing tax credit investments included in income tax expense $ 48 &#160; $ 42 &#160; $ 29 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNo LIHTC investment impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nAsset-backed securities \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments in asset-backed securities are collateralized by education loans sold to a third-party sponsored VIE. Citizens acts as primary servicer for the sold educational loans and receives a servicing fee. A third-party special servicer is responsible for all loans that become significantly delinquent. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company concluded that their investment in asset-backed securities, as well as the primary servicing fee, are considered variable interests in the VIE since some of the losses of the VIE could be absorbed by the Company&#8217;s interest in the asset-backed securities or the primary servicing fee. However, Citizens did not control the determination of the assets purchased by the VIE and does not control the servicing activities on significantly delinquent loans. Since these activities significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, the Company has concluded that Citizens is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate the VIE. \n\nRenewable Energy Entities \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments in certain renewable energy entities provide benefits from a return generated by government incentives plus other tax attributes that are associated with tax ownership (e.g., tax depreciation). As a tax equity investor, Citizens does not have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of these entities and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 123 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 12 - DEPOSITS \n\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks are carried at cost and include deposits that mature within one year. \n\nThe following table presents the major components of deposits: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Demand $ 49,283 &#160; $ 49,443 &#160; Money market 49,905 &#160; 47,216 &#160; Checking with interest 39,721 &#160; 30,409 &#160; Savings 29,805 &#160; 22,030 &#160; Term 12,010 &#160; 5,263 &#160; Total deposits $ 180,724 &#160; $ 154,361 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of term deposits by year as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2023 $ 10,723 &#160; 2024 991 &#160; 2025 156 &#160; 2026 74 &#160; 2027 63 &#160; 2028 and thereafter 3 &#160; Total $ 12,010 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the remaining maturities of term deposits with a denomination of $250,000 or more at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Three months or less $ 995 &#160; After three months through six months 101 &#160; After six months through twelve months 630 &#160; After twelve months 249 &#160; Total term deposits $ 1,975 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 13 - BORROWED FUNDS \n\nShort-term borrowed funds \n\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s short-term borrowed funds: \n\n&#160; ##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1 &#160; Other short-term borrowed funds 3 &#160; 73 &#160; Total short-term borrowed funds $ 3 &#160; $ 74 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 124 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nLong-term borrowed funds \n\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s long-term borrowed funds: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Parent Company: \n\n4.150 % fixed-rate subordinated debt, due September 2022 \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 168 &#160; \n\n3.750 % fixed-rate subordinated debt, due July 2024 \n\n90 &#160; 90 &#160; \n\n4.023 % fixed-rate subordinated debt, due October 2024 \n\n17 &#160; 17 &#160; \n\n4.350 % fixed-rate subordinated debt, due August 2025 \n\n133 &#160; 133 &#160; \n\n4.300 % fixed-rate subordinated debt, due December 2025 \n\n336 &#160; 336 &#160; \n\n2.850 % fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, due July 2026 \n\n498 &#160; 498 &#160; \n\n2.500 % fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, due February 2030 \n\n298 &#160; 298 &#160; \n\n3.250 % fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, due April 2030 \n\n746 &#160; 745 &#160; \n\n3.750 % fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due February 2031 \n\n69 &#160; 69 &#160; \n\n4.300 % fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due February 2031 \n\n135 &#160; 135 &#160; \n\n4.350 % fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due February 2031 \n\n61 &#160; 60 &#160; \n\n2.638 % fixed-rate subordinated debt, due September 2032 \n\n556 &#160; 550 &#160; \n\n5.641 % fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due May 2037 \n\n397 &#160; &#8212; &#160; CBNA&#8217;s Global Note Program: \n\n3.250 % senior unsecured notes, due February 2022 \n\n&#8212; &#160; 700 &#160; \n\n0.845 % floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due February 2022 (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 300 &#160; \n\n1.318 % floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due May 2022 (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 250 &#160; \n\n2.650 % senior unsecured notes, due May 2022 \n\n&#8212; &#160; 503 &#160; \n\n3.700 % senior unsecured notes, due March 2023 \n\n497 &#160; 512 &#160; \n\n5.676 % floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due March 2023 (1) \n\n250 &#160; 250 &#160; \n\n2.250 % senior unsecured notes, due April 2025 \n\n748 &#160; 746 &#160; \n\n4.119 % fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due May 2025 \n\n648 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\n6.064 % fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due October 2025 \n\n598 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\n3.750 % senior unsecured notes, due February 2026 \n\n475 &#160; 524 &#160; \n\n4.575 % fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due August 2028 \n\n797 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Additional Borrowings by CBNA and Other Subsidiaries: \n\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances, 4.283 % weighted average rate, due through 2041 (2) \n\n8,519 &#160; 19 &#160; Other 19 &#160; 29 &#160; Total long-term borrowed funds $ 15,887 &#160; $ 6,932 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Rate disclosed reflects the floating rate as of December 31, 2022, or final floating rate as applicable. \n\n(2) Rate disclosed reflects the weighted average rate as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe Parent Company&#8217;s long-term borrowed funds as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include principal balances of $ 3.4 billion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively, and unamortized deferred issuance costs and/or discounts of $ 75 million and $ 80 million, respectively.

The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in derivative assets and derivative liabilities at fair value. Certain derivatives are cleared through central clearing houses. Cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to central clearing houses who then becomes our counterparty.

Certain derivative transactions within these sub-groups are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, as described below: \n\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments \n\nThe Company&#8217;s institutional derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The net interest accruals on interest rate swaps designated in a fair value or cash flow hedge relationship are treated as an adjustment to interest income or interest expense of the item being hedged. The Company formally documents all hedging relationships at inception, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Company monitors the effectiveness of its hedge relationships during the duration of the hedge period. The methods utilized to assess hedge effectiveness vary based on the hedge relationship and the Company monitors each relationship to ensure that management&#8217;s initial intent continues to be satisfied. The Company discontinues hedge accounting treatment when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be, or has ceased to be, effective as a hedge and subsequently reflects changes in the fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship. \n\nFair Value Hedges \n\nIn a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in the same income statement line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the changes in fair value occur. \n\nThe following table presents the change in fair value of interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged, included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Affected Line Item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Interest rate swaps hedging borrowed funds ($ 69 ) ($ 72 ) $ 65 &#160; Interest expense - long-term borrowed funds Hedged long-term borrowed funds attributable to the risk being hedged 68 &#160; 71 &#160; ( 63 ) Interest expense - long-term borrowed funds Interest rate swaps hedging loans held for sale 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; Interest and fees on other loans held for sale Hedged loans held for sale attributable to the risk being hedged ( 13 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 17 ) Interest and fees on other loans held for sale Interest rate swaps hedging debt securities available for sale 29 &#160; 68 &#160; ( 104 ) Interest income - investment securities Hedged debt securities available for sale attributable to risk being hedged ( 29 ) ( 68 ) 104 &#160; Interest income - investment securities ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table reflects amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Debt securities available for sale Long-term borrowed funds Debt securities available for sale (1) \n\nLong-term borrowed funds Carrying amount of hedged assets $ &#8212; &#160; $&#8212; $ 6,042 &#160; $&#8212; Carrying amount of hedged liabilities &#8212; 972 &#160; &#8212; 2,239 &#160; Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of the hedged items &#8212; &#160; ( 27 ) 29 &#160; 42 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The Company designated $ 2.0 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with an amortized cost basis of $ 6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship, which commenced in the third quarter of 2019 and was terminated in the first quarter of 2022. \n\nCash Flow Hedges \n\nIn a cash flow hedge the entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings (net interest income) in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings. \n\nCitizens has entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to hedge a portion of the Company&#8217;s floating-rate assets and liabilities. All of these swaps have been deemed highly effective cash flow hedges. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 127 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company entered into zero-cost collar instruments with a notional amount of $ 1.5 billion comprised of purchasing an interest rate floor and selling an interest rate cap. These instruments expose Citizens to the variability in cash flows within the option strike rates and were structured so that the premium paid on the floor is equal and offsetting to the premium received on the cap. These amounts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and will be amortized over the life of the instruments. \n\nThe following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) recognized in OCI ($ 1,806 ) ($ 66 ) $ 130 &#160; Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into interest income ( 111 ) 183 &#160; 184 &#160; Amount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into interest expense ( 4 ) ( 48 ) ( 35 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nUsing the interest rate curve at December 31, 2022 with respect to cash flow hedge strategies, the Company estimates that approximately $ 704 million in pre-tax net losses will be reclassified from AOCI to net interest income over the next 12 months. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2022. \n\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments \n\nEconomic Hedges \n\nThe Company&#8217;s economic hedges include those related to offsetting customer derivatives, residential mortgage loan derivatives (including interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments) and derivatives to hedge its residential MSRs.

Compensation expense is adjusted for forfeitures as they occur. The related expense is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (e.g., vesting period) of the award. With respect to performance-based stock awards, compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probability of achievement of performance. Awards that continue to vest after retirement are expensed over the shorter of the period of time from grant date to the final vesting date or from the grant date to the date when an employee is retirement eligible.

This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years . \n\nCitizens recognized income tax benefits related to share-based compensation arrangements of $ 19 million, $ 12 million and $ 8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nNOTE 19 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nA summary of outstanding off-balance sheet arrangements is presented below: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Commitments to extend credit $ 96,076 &#160; $ 84,206 &#160; Letters of credit 2,119 &#160; 1,998 &#160; Risk participation agreements 4 &#160; 39 &#160; Loans sold with recourse 92 &#160; 82 &#160; Marketing rights 23 &#160; 26 &#160; Total $ 98,314 &#160; $ 86,351 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCommitments to Extend Credit \n\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with conditions contractually agreed upon in advance. Generally, the commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. \n\nLetters of Credit \n\nLetters of credit in the table above reflect commercial, standby financial and standby performance letters of credit. Financial and performance standby letters of credit are issued by the Company for the benefit of its customers. They are used as conditional guarantees of payment to a third party in the event the customer either fails to make specific payments (financial) or fails to complete a specific project (performance). The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss in the event of counterparty nonperformance in connection with the above instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Generally, letters of credit are collateralized by cash, accounts receivable, inventory or investment securities. Credit risk associated with letters of credit is considered in determining the appropriate amounts of allowances for unfunded commitments. Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit are issued for terms of up to ten years and one year , respectively. \n\nOther Commitments \n\nCitizens has additional off-balance sheet arrangements that are summarized below: \n\n&#8226; Marketing Rights - During 2003, Citizens entered into a 25 -year agreement to acquire the naming and marketing rights of a baseball stadium in Pennsylvania. \n\n&#8226; Loans sold with recourse - Citizens is an originator and servicer of residential mortgages and routinely sells such mortgage loans in the secondary market and to GSEs. In the context of such sales, the Company makes certain representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying loans and, as a result, may be contractually required to repurchase such loans or indemnify certain parties against losses for certain breaches of those representations and warranties. The Company also sells the government guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans to outside investors, for which it retains the servicing rights. \n\n&#8226; Risk Participation Agreements - RPAs are guarantees issued by the Company to other parties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party. The current amount of credit exposure is spread out over multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2022, the remaining terms on these RPAs ranged from less than one year to seven years . \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 134 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nContingencies \n\nThe Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant risks. A certain amount of litigation ordinarily results from the nature of the Company&#8217;s banking and other businesses. The Company is a party to legal proceedings, including class actions. The Company is also the subject of investigations, reviews, subpoenas, and regulatory matters arising out of its normal business operations which, in some instances, relate to concerns about fair lending, unfair and/or deceptive practices, and mortgage-related issues. In addition, the Company engages in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities on a regular and ongoing basis regarding various issues, and any issues discussed or identified may result in investigatory or other action being taken. Litigation and regulatory matters may result in settlements, damages, fines, penalties, public or private censure, increased costs, required remediation, restrictions on business activities, or other impacts on the Company. \n\nIn these disputes and proceedings, the Company contests liability and the amount of damages as appropriate. Given their complex nature, and based on the Company's experience, it may be years before some of these matters are finally resolved. Moreover, before liability can be reasonably estimated for a claim, numerous legal and factual issues may need to be examined, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal issues relevant to the proceedings in question. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. The Company recognizes a provision for a claim when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, it is probable that a liability exists and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In many proceedings, however, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable or to estimate the amount of any loss. \n\nBased on information currently available, the advice of legal counsel and other advisers, and established reserves, management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, potentially arising from these proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNOTE 20 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nCitizens measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities for which fair value is the required or elected measurement basis of accounting. Additionally, fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Citizens also applies the fair value measurement guidance to determine amounts reported for certain disclosures in this Note for assets and liabilities that are not required to be reported at fair value in the financial statements. \n\nFair Value Option \n\nCitizens elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS and certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS at fair value. The election of the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities is optional and irrevocable. Applying fair value accounting to residential mortgage LHFS better aligns the reported results of the economic changes in the value of these loans and their related economic hedge instruments. Certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS are managed by a commercial secondary loan desk that provides liquidity to banks, finance companies and institutional investors. Applying fair value accounting to this portfolio is appropriate because the Company holds these loans with the intent to sell within the near-term periods. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 135 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of LHFS measured at fair value: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Aggregate Fair Value Aggregate Unpaid Principal Aggregate Fair Value Greater (Less) Than Aggregate Unpaid Principal Aggregate Fair Value Aggregate Unpaid Principal Aggregate Fair Value Greater (Less) Than Aggregate Unpaid Principal Residential mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value $ 666 &#160; $ 656 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 2,657 &#160; $ 2,591 &#160; $ 66 &#160; Commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans held for sale, at fair value 108 &#160; 127 &#160; ( 19 ) 76 &#160; 79 &#160; ( 3 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale \n\nThe fair value of residential mortgage LHFS is derived from observable mortgage security prices and includes adjustments for loan servicing value, agency guarantee fees, and other loan level attributes which are mostly observable in the marketplace. Credit risk does not significantly impact the valuation since these loans are sold shortly after origination. Therefore, the Company classifies residential mortgage LHFS in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nResidential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option are initially measured at fair value when the financial asset is originated or purchased. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nInterest income on residential mortgage loans held for sale is calculated based on the contractual interest rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \n\nCommercial and Industrial, and Commercial Real Estate Loans Held for Sale \n\nThe fair value of commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS is estimated using observable prices of similar loans that transact in the marketplace. In addition, Citizens uses external pricing services that provide estimates of fair values based on quotes from various dealers transacting in the market, sector curves or benchmarking techniques. Therefore, the Company classifies the commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans managed by the commercial secondary loan desk in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy given the observable market inputs. \n\nThe loans accounted for under the fair value option are initially measured at fair value when the financial asset is recognized. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in capital markets fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Since all loans in the Company&#8217;s commercial trading portfolio consist of floating rate obligations, all changes in fair value are due to changes in credit risk. Such credit-related fair value changes may include observed changes in overall credit spreads and/or changes to the creditworthiness of an individual borrower. \n\nInterest income on commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans held for sale is calculated based on the contractual interest rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements \n\nCitizens measures fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market, where available. If quoted prices are not available, observable market-based inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value, whenever possible. Such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and foreign exchange rates. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 136 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nA portion of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, including securities available for sale, derivative instruments and other investment securities. In addition, the Company elects to account for its loans associated with its mortgage banking business and secondary loan trading desk at fair value. Citizens classifies its assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the three-level valuation hierarchy: \n\n&#8226; Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\n&#8226; Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n\n&#8226; Level 3. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market information and that are significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nClassification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. For instruments classified in Levels 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data, there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value. For instruments classified in Level 3, management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data. \n\nCitizens reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on period-end balances. \n\nCitizens utilizes a variety of valuation techniques to measure its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The valuation methodologies used for significant assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet at fair value on a recurring basis are presented below: \n\nDebt securities available for sale \n\nThe fair value of debt securities classified as AFS is based upon quoted prices, if available. Where observable quoted prices are available in an active market, the security is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Classes of instruments that are valued using this market approach include debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value for the security is estimated under the market or income approach using pricing models. These instruments are classified as Level 2 because they currently trade in active markets and the inputs to the valuations are observable. The pricing models used to value securities generally begin with market prices (or rates) for similar instruments and make adjustments based on the characteristics of the instrument being valued. These adjustments reflect assumptions made regarding the sensitivity of each security&#8217;s value to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. Classes of instruments that are valued using this market approach include specified pool mortgage &#8220;pass-through&#8221; securities, CLOs, and other debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and state and political subdivisions. The pricing models used to value securities under the income approach generally begin with the contractual cash flows of each security and make adjustments based on forecasted prepayment speeds, default rates, and other market-observable information. The adjusted cash flows are then discounted at a rate derived from observed rates of return for comparable assets or liabilities that are traded in the market. Classes of instruments that are valued using this market approach include residential and commercial CMOs. \n\nA significant majority of the Company&#8217;s Level 1 and 2 debt securities are priced using an external pricing service. Citizens verifies the accuracy of the pricing provided by its primary outside pricing service on a quarterly basis. This process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for the Company&#8217;s securities portfolio for comparison purposes. Any valuation discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and, if necessary, corroborated by an independent outside broker. \n\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation model, securities are classified as Level 3. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 137 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights \n\nMSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. MSRs are classified as Level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs. The fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which uses assumptions, including weighted-average life, prepayment assumptions and weighted-average option adjusted spread. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio, and comparisons to market transactions. In addition, the MSR Policy is approved by the Asset Liability Committee. Refer to Note 8 for more information. \n\nDerivatives \n\nThe majority of the Company&#8217;s derivatives portfolio is composed of interest rate swaps, which are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For these interest rate derivatives, fair value is determined utilizing models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as swap rates and yield curves. The pricing models used to value interest rate swaps calculate the sum of each instrument&#8217;s fixed and variable cash flows, which are then discounted using an appropriate yield curve (i.e., Overnight Index Swap curve) to arrive at the fair value of each swap. The pricing models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the methodologies used do not require significant judgment. Citizens also considers certain adjustments to the modeled price that market participants would make when pricing each instrument, including a credit valuation adjustment that reflects the credit quality of the swap counterparty. Citizens incorporates the effect of exposure to a particular counterparty&#8217;s credit by netting its derivative contracts with the available collateral and calculating a credit valuation adjustment on the basis of the net position with the counterparty where permitted. The determination of this adjustment requires judgment on behalf of Company management; however, the total amount of this portfolio-level adjustment is not material to the total fair value of the interest rate swaps . Therefore, interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy. \n\nThe fair value of commodity derivatives uses the mid-point of market observable quoted prices as an input into the fair value model. The model uses the observed market prices combined with other market observed inputs to derive the fair value of the instrument, which generally classifies it as Level 2 instrument. \n\nThe fair value of foreign exchange derivatives uses the mid-point of daily quoted currency spot prices. A valuation model estimates fair value based on the quoted spot rates together with interest rate yield curves and forward currency rates. Since all of these inputs are observable in the market, foreign exchange derivatives are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe fair value of TBA contracts is estimated using observable prices of similar loan pools that transact in the marketplace, as well as sector curves and benchmarking techniques. Therefore, the Company classifies TBA contracts in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy given the observable market inputs. \n\nOther contracts primarily consist of interest rate lock commitments. Interest rate lock commitments are valued utilizing internally generated loan closing rate assumptions, which are a significant unobservable input, and therefore are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 138 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nEquity Securities, at fair value \n\nThe fair value of money market mutual fund investments is determined based upon unadjusted quoted market prices and is considered a Level 1 fair value measurement. \n\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including gross derivative assets and liabilities, on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Debt securities available for sale: Mortgage-backed securities $ 19,313 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 19,313 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Collateralized loan obligations 1,206 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,206 &#160; &#8212; &#160; State and political subdivisions 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. Treasury and other 3,486 &#160; 3,486 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total debt securities available for sale 24,007 &#160; 3,486 &#160; 20,521 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Loans held for sale, at fair value: Residential loans held for sale 666 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 666 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Commercial loans held for sale 108 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 108 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total loans held for sale, at fair value 774 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 774 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mortgage servicing rights 1,530 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,530 &#160; Derivative assets: Interest rate contracts 347 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 347 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts 527 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 527 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Commodities contracts 953 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 953 &#160; &#8212; &#160; TBA contracts 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other contracts 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; Total derivative assets 1,839 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,834 &#160; 5 &#160; \n\nEquity securities, at fair value (1) \n\n110 &#160; 110 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total assets $ 28,260 &#160; $ 3,596 &#160; $ 23,129 &#160; $ 1,535 &#160; Derivative liabilities: Interest rate contracts $ 1,632 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,632 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts 519 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 519 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Commodities contracts 942 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 942 &#160; &#8212; &#160; TBA contracts 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other contracts 4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 &#160; Total derivative liabilities 3,111 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,107 &#160; 4 &#160; Total liabilities $ 3,111 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,107 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes investments of $ 43 million included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient.

Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in gross deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent changes in taxes expected to be paid in the future due to reversals of temporary differences between the bases of the assets and liabilities as measured under tax laws and their bases reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements as measured under GAAP. \n\nCitizens also assesses the probability that the positions taken, or expected to be taken, in its income tax returns will be sustained by taxing authorities. A &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; (more than 50 percent) recognition threshold must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized. Tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained are reflected in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 144 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents total income tax expense: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Income tax expense $ 582 &#160; $ 658 &#160; $ 241 &#160; Tax effect of changes in OCI ( 1,319 ) ( 199 ) 112 &#160; Total comprehensive income tax expense (benefit) ($ 737 ) $ 459 &#160; $ 353 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the components of income tax expense: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Current Deferred Total Year Ended December 31, 2022 U.S. federal $ 355 &#160; $ 88 &#160; $ 443 &#160; State and local 170 &#160; ( 31 ) 139 &#160; Total $ 525 &#160; $ 57 &#160; $ 582 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2021 U.S. federal $ 871 &#160; ($ 345 ) $ 526 &#160; State and local 216 &#160; ( 84 ) 132 &#160; Total $ 1,087 &#160; ($ 429 ) $ 658 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2020 U.S. federal $ 377 &#160; ($ 181 ) $ 196 &#160; State and local 102 &#160; ( 57 ) 45 &#160; Total $ 479 &#160; ($ 238 ) $ 241 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation between the U.S. federal income tax rate and the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions, except ratio data) Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate U.S. federal income tax expense and tax rate $ 558 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 625 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 273 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % Increase (decrease) resulting from: State and local income taxes (net of federal benefit) 133 &#160; 5.0 &#160; 126 &#160; 4.2 &#160; 54 &#160; 4.2 &#160; Bank-owned life insurance ( 19 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 14 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 12 ) ( 0.9 ) Tax-exempt interest ( 8 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 7 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 10 ) ( 0.7 ) Tax advantaged investments (including related credits) ( 102 ) ( 3.8 ) ( 95 ) ( 3.2 ) ( 68 ) ( 5.3 ) Other tax credits ( 9 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 7 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 6 ) ( 0.5 ) Adjustments for uncertain tax positions 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; 0.1 &#160; ( 1 ) ( 0.1 ) Non-deductible FDIC premiums 20 &#160; 0.7 &#160; 14 &#160; 0.5 &#160; 14 &#160; 1.1 &#160; Legacy tax matters 3 &#160; 0.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 4 ) ( 0.3 ) Other 5 &#160; 0.2 &#160; 13 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total income tax expense and tax rate $ 582 &#160; 21.9 &#160; % $ 658 &#160; 22.1 &#160; % $ 241 &#160; 18.5 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 145 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Other comprehensive income $ 1,546 &#160; $ 227 &#160; Allowance for credit losses 511 &#160; 448 &#160; Federal and state net operating and capital loss carryforwards 77 &#160; 50 &#160; Accrued expenses not currently deductible 863 &#160; 676 &#160; Investment and other tax credit carryforwards 131 &#160; 110 &#160; Other 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total deferred tax assets 3,147 &#160; 1,511 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 133 ) ( 103 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 3,014 &#160; 1,408 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Leasing transactions 287 &#160; 331 &#160; Amortization of intangibles 413 &#160; 379 &#160; Depreciation 470 &#160; 256 &#160; Pension and other employee compensation plans 128 &#160; 132 &#160; Partnerships 87 &#160; 95 &#160; Deferred Income 12 &#160; 85 &#160; MSRs 203 &#160; 130 &#160; Total deferred tax liabilities 1,600 &#160; 1,408 &#160; Net deferred tax asset (liability) $ 1,414 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded, as necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that management concludes are more likely than not to be realized. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $ 719 million and capital loss carryforwards of $ 133 million. The majority of the federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire in varying amounts through 2040, while the capital loss and tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts through 2027 and 2029, respectively. Limitations on the ability to realize these carryforwards are reflected in the associated valuation allowance. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of $ 133 million against various deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses, capital losses and state tax credits, as the Company&#8217;s current assessment is that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize a portion of the deferred tax assets related to these items. \n\nEffective with the fiscal year ended September 30, 1997, the reserve method for bad debts was no longer permitted for tax purposes. The repeal of the reserve method required the recapture of the reserve balance in excess of certain base year reserve amounts attributable to years ended prior to 1988. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s base year loan loss reserves attributable to years ended prior to 1988, for which no deferred income taxes have been provided, was $ 557 million. This base year reserve may become taxable if certain distributions are made with respect to the stock of the Company or if CBNA ceases to qualify as a bank for tax purposes. No actions are planned that would cause this reserve to become wholly or partially taxable. \n\nCitizens files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and local jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state and local income tax examinations by major tax authorities for years before 2018. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 146 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at the beginning of the year $ 7 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 5 &#160; Gross increase for tax positions related to current year &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Gross increase for tax positions related to prior years &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Decrease for tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Decrease for tax positions related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of year $ 6 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The difference between the benefit recognized for a position and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. Any adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not expect the balance of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next twelve months. \n\nNOTE 24 - EARNINGS PER SHARE \n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Net income available to common stockholders represents net income after preferred stock dividends, accretion of the discount on preferred stock issuances, and gains or losses from any repurchases of preferred stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, plus potential dilutive shares such as share-based payment awards and warrants using the treasury stock method. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except share and per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Numerator (basic and diluted): Net income $ 2,073 &#160; $ 2,319 &#160; $ 1,057 &#160; Less: Preferred stock dividends 113 &#160; 113 &#160; 107 &#160; Net income available to common stockholders $ 1,960 &#160; $ 2,206 &#160; $ 950 &#160; Denominator: Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 475,959,815 &#160; 425,669,451 &#160; 427,062,537 &#160; Dilutive common shares: share-based awards 1,843,327 &#160; 1,766,367 &#160; 1,095,243 &#160; Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 477,803,142 &#160; 427,435,818 &#160; 428,157,780 &#160; Earnings per common share: Basic $ 4.12 &#160; $ 5.18 &#160; $ 2.22 &#160; Diluted (1) \n\n4.10 &#160; 5.16 &#160; 2.22 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Potential dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive.

Our banking subsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC. \n\nUnder the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, the Company and CBNA must meet the following specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a BHC the Company&#8217;s SCB of 3.4 % is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above for CBNA. The Company&#8217;s SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect the Company&#8217;s planned common stock dividends. In addition, the Company must not be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive with any of its regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain actions that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 147 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents the capital ratios for the Company and CBNA under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules. The Company and CBNA have both declared as an &#8220;AOCI opt-out&#8221; institution, which means they are not required to recognize the AOCI impact of net unrealized gains and losses on debt securities and accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets in regulatory capital. In addition, both entities elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for a two-year period ending December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period ending December 31, 2024, to phase-in the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. \n\n##TABLE_START Actual Required Minimum Capital (in millions, except ratio data) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (1) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 CET1 capital CFG $ 18,574 &#160; 10.0 &#160; % $ 14,633 &#160; 7.9 &#160; % CBNA 20,669 &#160; 11.2 &#160; 12,935 &#160; 7.0 &#160; Tier 1 capital CFG 20,588 &#160; 11.1 &#160; 17,411 &#160; 9.4 &#160; CBNA 20,669 &#160; 11.2 &#160; 15,706 &#160; 8.5 &#160; Total capital CFG 23,755 &#160; 12.8 &#160; 21,116 &#160; 11.4 &#160; CBNA 23,534 &#160; 12.7 &#160; 19,402 &#160; 10.5 &#160; Tier 1 leverage CFG 20,588 &#160; 9.3 &#160; 8,831 &#160; 4.0 &#160; CBNA 20,669 &#160; 9.4 &#160; 8,807 &#160; 4.0 &#160; As of December 31, 2021 CET1 capital CFG $ 15,656 &#160; 9.9 &#160; % $ 12,548 &#160; 7.9 &#160; % CBNA 17,039 &#160; 10.7 &#160; 11,099 &#160; 7.0 &#160; Tier 1 capital CFG 17,670 &#160; 11.1 &#160; 14,930 &#160; 9.4 &#160; CBNA 17,039 &#160; 10.7 &#160; 13,477 &#160; 8.5 &#160; Total capital CFG 20,244 &#160; 12.7 &#160; 18,107 &#160; 11.4 &#160; CBNA 19,600 &#160; 12.4 &#160; 16,648 &#160; 10.5 &#160; Tier 1 leverage CFG 17,670 &#160; 9.7 &#160; 7,272 &#160; 4.0 &#160; CBNA 17,039 &#160; 9.4 &#160; 7,251 &#160; 4.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents minimum requirement under the current capital framework plus the SCB of 3.4 % and CCB of 2.5 % for CFG and CBNA, respectively. The SCB and CCB are not applicable to the Tier 1 leverage ratio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s capital distributions are subject to the oversight of the FRB. Under the FRB&#8217;s SCB framework failure to maintain risk-based capital ratios above respective minimum requirements including the SCB would result in graduated restrictions on the Company&#8217;s ability to make certain discretionary bonus payments and capital distributions, including common stock dividends and share repurchases. The timing and amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the Company&#8217;s capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, receipt of required regulatory approvals and other regulatory considerations. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by the Board of Directors prior to execution. See Note 17 for more information regarding the Company&#8217;s common stock repurchases and dividends. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 148 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nDividends payable by CBNA are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a &#8220;recent earnings&#8221; test and an &#8220;undivided profits&#8221; test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of current year net income plus retained net income for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity&#8217;s &#8220;undivided profits&#8221; (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal banking regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends out of their current operating earnings only. \n\nNOTE 26 - BUSINESS OPERATING SEGMENTS \n\nCitizens is managed by its Chief Executive Officer on a segment basis. The Company&#8217;s two business operating segments are Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served. Each segment has a segment head who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer has final authority over resource allocation decisions and performance assessment. The business segments reflect this management structure and the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer. \n\nReportable Segments \n\nSegment results are determined based upon the Company&#8217;s management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and statement of operations items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around the Company&#8217;s organizational and management structure. The results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. A description of each reportable segment and table of financial results is presented below: \n\nConsumer Banking \n\nThe Consumer Banking segment focuses on retail customers and small businesses with annual revenues of up to $25 million. It offers traditional banking products and services including deposit products, home loans, education loans, credit cards, business loans, and unsecured product finance and personal loans in addition to financial management services. It also operates an indirect auto financing business, providing financing for both new and used vehicles through auto dealerships. The segment&#8217;s distribution channels include a branch network, ATMs and a work force of experienced specialists ranging from financial consultants, mortgage loan officers and business banking officers to private bankers. The Company&#8217;s Consumer Banking value proposition is based on providing simple, easy to understand product offerings and a convenient banking experience with a more personalized approach. \n\nCommercial Banking \n\nThe Commercial Banking segment primarily targets companies with annual revenues from $25 million to $3.0 billion and provides a full complement of financial products and solutions including loans, leases, trade financing, deposits, cash management, commercial cards, foreign exchange, interest rate risk management, corporate finance and capital markets advisory capabilities. It focuses on middle-market companies, large corporations and institutions and has dedicated teams with industry expertise in government banking, not-for-profit, healthcare, technology, professionals, oil and gas, asset finance, franchise finance, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, private equity and sponsor finance. While the segment&#8217;s business development efforts are predominantly focused in the Company&#8217;s footprint, some of its specialized industry businesses also operate selectively on a national basis (such as healthcare, asset finance and franchise finance). A key component of Commercial Banking&#8217;s growth strategy is to bring ideas to clients that help their businesses thrive, and in doing so, expand the loan portfolio and ancillary product sales. \n\nNon-segment Operations \n\nOther \n\nNon-segment operations are classified as Other and include assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision (benefit) for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense not attributed to our Consumer or Commercial Banking segments as well as treasury and community development. \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 149 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nManagement accounting practices utilized by the Company as the basis of presentation for segment results include the following: \n\nFTP adjustments \n\nCitizens utilizes an FTP system to eliminate the effect of interest rate risk from the segments&#8217; net interest income. This risk is centrally managed within the Treasury function and reported in Other non-segment operations. The FTP methodology provides a funds credit for sources of funds and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. The sum of the interest income/expense and FTP charges/credits for each segment is its designated net interest income. The offset to these FTP charges and credits is recorded in Other non-segment operations. \n\nEffective January 1, 2022, the Company refined its FTP credit methodology for deposits provided by each business segment. The rationale for this FTP refinement was to better estimate the net interest income resulting from the strong growth in deposits caused by the COVID government stimulus. This resulted in lower net interest income, primarily in Consumer, offset by an increase in Other. Prior periods have not been restated. \n\nProvision for credit losses allocation \n\nProvision for credit losses is allocated to each business segment based on actual net charge-offs recognized by the business segment. The difference between the consolidated provision for credit losses and the business segments&#8217; net charge-offs is reflected in Other non-segment operations. \n\nIncome tax allocation \n\nIncome taxes are assessed to each line of business at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Other non-segment operations. \n\nExpense allocation \n\nNoninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line&#8217;s operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services. \n\nGoodwill \n\nFor impairment testing purposes, the Company allocates all goodwill to its Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units. \n\nSubstantially all revenues generated and long-lived assets held by the Company&#8217;s business segments are derived from clients that reside in the United States. Neither business segment earns revenue from a single external customer that represents ten percent or more of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. \n\n##TABLE_START As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 (in millions) Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other Consolidated Net interest income $ 4,043 &#160; $ 2,103 &#160; ($ 134 ) $ 6,012 &#160; Noninterest income 1,063 &#160; 845 &#160; 101 &#160; 2,009 &#160; Total revenue 5,106 &#160; 2,948 &#160; ( 33 ) 8,021 &#160; Noninterest expense 3,391 &#160; 1,223 &#160; 278 &#160; 4,892 &#160; Profit (loss) before provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,715 &#160; 1,725 &#160; ( 311 ) 3,129 &#160; Provision (benefit) for credit losses 226 &#160; 46 &#160; 202 &#160; 474 &#160; Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 1,489 &#160; 1,679 &#160; ( 513 ) 2,655 &#160; Income tax expense (benefit) 381 &#160; 375 &#160; ( 174 ) 582 &#160; Net income (loss) $ 1,108 &#160; $ 1,304 &#160; ($ 339 ) $ 2,073 &#160; Total average assets $ 86,147 &#160; $ 74,919 &#160; $ 53,995 &#160; $ 215,061 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 150 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 (in millions) Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other Consolidated Net interest income $ 3,562 &#160; $ 1,706 &#160; ($ 756 ) $ 4,512 &#160; Noninterest income 1,223 &#160; 809 &#160; 103 &#160; 2,135 &#160; Total revenue 4,785 &#160; 2,515 &#160; ( 653 ) 6,647 &#160; Noninterest expense 2,987 &#160; 973 &#160; 121 &#160; 4,081 &#160; Profit (loss) before provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,798 &#160; 1,542 &#160; ( 774 ) 2,566 &#160; Provision (benefit) for credit losses 185 &#160; 156 &#160; ( 752 ) ( 411 ) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 1,613 &#160; 1,386 &#160; ( 22 ) 2,977 &#160; Income tax expense (benefit) 410 &#160; 300 &#160; ( 52 ) 658 &#160; Net income (loss) $ 1,203 &#160; $ 1,086 &#160; $ 30 &#160; $ 2,319 &#160; Total average assets $ 75,509 &#160; $ 57,617 &#160; $ 51,980 &#160; $ 185,106 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START As of and for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 (in millions) Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other Consolidated Net interest income $ 3,311 &#160; $ 1,643 &#160; ($ 368 ) $ 4,586 &#160; Noninterest income 1,655 &#160; 595 &#160; 69 &#160; 2,319 &#160; Total revenue 4,966 &#160; 2,238 &#160; ( 299 ) 6,905 &#160; Noninterest expense 2,964 &#160; 860 &#160; 167 &#160; 3,991 &#160; Profit (loss) before provision (benefit) for credit losses 2,002 &#160; 1,378 &#160; ( 466 ) 2,914 &#160; Provision (benefit) for credit losses 288 &#160; 398 &#160; 930 &#160; 1,616 &#160; Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 1,714 &#160; 980 &#160; ( 1,396 ) 1,298 &#160; Income tax expense (benefit) 429 &#160; 206 &#160; ( 394 ) 241 &#160; Net income (loss) $ 1,285 &#160; $ 774 &#160; ($ 1,002 ) $ 1,057 &#160; Total average assets $ 72,022 &#160; $ 60,839 &#160; $ 43,581 &#160; $ 176,442 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Citizens Financial Group, Inc. | 151 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 27 - PARENT COMPANY FINANCIALS \n\nCondensed Statements of Operations \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160;(in millions) 2022 2021 2020 OPERATING INCOME: Income from bank subsidiaries, excluding equity in undistributed income: Dividends $ 450 &#160; $ 1,120 &#160; $ 900 &#160; Interest 39 &#160; 35 &#160; 42 &#160; Management and service fees 69 &#160; 64 &#160; 54 &#160; Income from nonbank subsidiaries, excluding equity in undistributed income: Dividends 43 &#160; 57 &#160; 40 &#160; Interest 3 &#160; 2 &#160; 4 &#160; All other operating income 1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Total operating income 605 &#160; 1,279 &#160; 1,041 &#160; OPERATING EXPENSE: Salaries and employee benefits 43 &#160; 36 &#160; 27 &#160; Interest expense 125 &#160; 119 &#160; 120 &#160; All other expenses 28 &#160; 28 &#160; 30 &#160; Total operating expense 196 &#160; 183 &#160; 177 &#160; Income (loss) before taxes and undistributed income 409 &#160; 1,096 &#160; 864 &#160; Income tax expense (benefit) ( 13 ) ( 16 ) ( 16 ) Income before undistributed income of subsidiaries 422 &#160; 1,112 &#160; 880 &#160; Equity in undistributed income (losses) of subsidiaries: Bank 1,724 &#160; 1,188 &#160; 170 &#160; Nonbank ( 73 ) 19 &#160; 7 &#160; Net income $ 2,073 &#160; $ 2,319 &#160; $ 1,057 &#160; \n\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes (1) \n\n( 3,895 ) ( 605 ) 351 &#160; Total comprehensive income (loss) ($ 1,822 ) $ 1,714 &#160; $ 1,408 &#160; ##TABLE_END (1) See Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for comprehensive income (loss) detail. \n\nIn accordance with federal and state banking regulations, dividends paid by CBNA to the Company are subject to certain limitations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nThe Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, the Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting are included in Item 8. \n\n"
