We grew our market share and positioned our businesses for continued success in the future. In 2022, we delivered sales growth of 3% (6% organically (1) , 7% organically excluding lost Russian sales (2) ), led by strong demand in our Commercial Aviation, Advanced Materials, and Building Products businesses, as we experienced sales growth in three of our four reportable business segments. \n\nEmpowered by our Honeywell Accelerator operating model, we adapted our approach to strained supply chains and mitigated profitability loss due to inflation. In 2022, we deepened commitments with critical suppliers, improved demand forecasting, enhanced communication across our businesses to coordinate larger orders with key suppliers, and reengineered products in an effort to significantly mitigate sales risk. We also embedded comprehensive near real-time inflation analysis into our operating system, enabling strategic pricing actions to help stay ahead of the inflation curve and protect profitability. We maintained our commitment to create long-term shareowner value by realizing the benefits of operational excellence and deploying $7.9 billion to capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions, which was approximately $2.6 billion in excess of our operating cash flow for the year. \n\nAs we look forward, we intend to continue deploying capital to high-return opportunities, including software and services and sustainable technologies, which are intended to position our business for future growth. In 2023, we expect macroeconomic factors to remain turbulent. We continue to carry a robust backlog of $29.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, that provides a strong foundation for growth. \n\n##TABLE_START YEAR IN REVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSales up 3 % , up 6% on an organic (1) basis, or up 7% on an organic basis excluding lost Russian sales (2) \n\nRecord backlog of Operating cash flows of $35.5 BILLION $29.6 BILLION $5.3 BILLION as we remain focused on leveraging our robust operating model to deliver growth despite headwinds from inflation, supply chain constraints, and impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as of year-end, demonstrating strong demand in our end markets and positioning us well to convert for future growth as we remain focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Organic sales % change and Organic sales % change excluding lost Russian sales are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the section titled Consolidated Operating Results within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the definition and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure. \n\n(2) Lost Russian sales is defined as the year-over-year decline in sales due to the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. This does not reflect management&#8217;s estimate of 2022 Russian sales absent the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. \n\n3 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nBUSINESS OBJECTIVES \n\nOur businesses are focused on the following objectives: \n\n##TABLE_START 1 Driving profitable growth by delivering innovative products through research and development and technological excellence, and through continued enhancement of our footprint in high growth regions; 2 Continuing to execute on our strategy to be a premier software-industrial company, including the ongoing expansion of Honeywell Forge connected solutions for aircraft, buildings, cybersecurity, plants, and workers and driving a recurring revenue model across the Company.

Brand identity, service to customers, and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services. Our products face considerable price competition. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. \n\nBACKLOG \n\nOur backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 3 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $29,558 million and $27,682 million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We expect to recognize approximately 62% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2023, and the remaining balance thereafter. \n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT SALES \n\nThe Company, principally through our Aerospace reportable business segment, sells to the U.S. government acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, including the U.S. Department of Defense (as both a prime contractor and subcontractor). We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2023 federal defense spending due to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs, and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified customer base. \n\n##TABLE_START U.S. government sales ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense $ 2,886 $ 3,219 $ 3,661 Sales to other U.S. government departments and agencies 546 703 557 Total sales to the U.S. government $ 3,432 &#160; $ 3,922 &#160; $ 4,218 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n7 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS \n\nWe engage in manufacturing, sales, service, and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports represented 12% of our total sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 40% of our total sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START Manufactured products and systems and performance of services Year Ended December 31, 2022 Aerospace Honeywell Building Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies Safety and Productivity Solutions &#160; (% of Segment Sales) U.S. exports 24 % 2 % 11 % 2 % Non-U.S. manufactured products/services 19 % 62 % 53 % 37 % ##TABLE_END\n\nInformation related to risks related to our foreign operations is included in the section titled Risk Factors under the caption &#8220;Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.&#8221; \n\nRAW MATERIALS \n\nThe vast majority of principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available; however, during 2022, we experienced supply chain constraints for certain raw materials. We implemented short-term and long-term mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of disruptions, including digital solutions to assist in identifying and managing shortages. Mitigation strategies include material supply tracking tools, accelerated processes to communicate supply shortages, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Where we cannot procure certain raw materials, we redesigned existing products or developed new products to satisfy current and changing demand where feasible. Redesigned products, or the development of new products, undergo product quality controls and engineering qualification prior to releasing to our customers. Further, our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source raw materials. We continue to leverage existing supplier relationships and are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. \n\nPrices of certain key raw materials are expected to fluctuate, including copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum in our Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment and nickel, steel, titanium, and other metals in our Aerospace reportable business segment. We offset raw material cost increases with formula-driven or long-term supply agreements, price increases, and hedging activities where feasible. We anticipate that supply chain constraints for certain raw materials will continue into 2023; however, we believe our short-term and long-term mitigation strategies position us well to mitigate and reduce the impact these factors may have on our businesses. As such, we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2023. \n\nSee the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on supply chain constraints. \n\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS \n\nOur reportable business segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, trademarks, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks, licenses, and distribution rights are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. \n\n8 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nREGULATIONS \n\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations, including requirements regarding the protection of human health and the environment. We design our policies, practices, and procedures to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. \n\nWe engage in the handling, manufacturing, use, and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We design policies, practices, and procedures to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and to ensure that our handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use, or disposal of these substances. \n\nAmong other environmental requirements, we are subject to the Federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s National Priority List. While there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. \n\nWe do not believe that Federal, State, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect in the foreseeable future on the Company&#8217;s business and we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. \n\nBeyond our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with other government regulations has not had, and based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. See the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on government regulation that could impact our business. \n\nSUSTAINABLE COMMITMENTS AND SOLUTIONS \n\nOur commitment to being environmentally responsible is reflected in the extensive work we do to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increase energy efficiency, conserve water, minimize waste, and drive efficiency throughout our operations. Honeywell also champions responsible remediation projects and efforts to make our products safer and more sustainable. \n\nCARBON NEUTRAL PLEDGE BY 2035 \n\nIn 2021, we announced our commitment to be carbon neutral by 2035 in our facilities and operations. Our GHG reduction program initially began in 2004, in our view setting us well on our way to achieving this commitment. We are allocating resources each year to projects that support this target: \n\n&#8226; Energy Efficiency Improvements. Since project tracking began in 2010, more than 6,300 sustainability projects, including building automation and controls, lighting, compressed air and gas systems, and mechanical upgrades have been implemented at our facilities. Our largest sites are required to identify their significant energy use in line with ISO 50001, obtain an energy audit on an established cycle, train personnel on energy management, and track identified projects via our standard database. This ensures a robust pipeline of both low-cost and capital projects that can be considered for execution. As of December 31, 2022, 26 Honeywell locations have achieved ISO 50001, the global energy management systems standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving energy management. \n\n&#8226; Fleet Electrification. We developed a strategy to further improve our fleet&#8217;s fuel economy through a plan to electrify our global fleet of over 7,500 vehicles where conditions and markets allow by 2035 or earlier. In 2022, we took delivery of our first fully electric light duty vehicles (LDVs) in North America as part of an initial pilot. This pilot will inform and shape our future policies and strategy, adoption rate by business group, and vehicle class selection. \n\n&#8226; Renewable Energy Transition. We are investing in renewable energy resources. For example, we are implementing multiple solar projects, which include solar rooftop and carport solar systems to reduce our power grid consumption. \n\n9 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nESG OFFERINGS AND SOLUTIONS \n\nWe strive to lead the marketplace in sustainable technology development and help our customers meet their sustainability goals. We are innovating to solve the world&#8217;s toughest environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges. The graphic below demonstrates our multitude of ESG-oriented offerings and solutions. \n\nBuilding on the Company&#8217;s existing technologies and demonstrating our continued commitment to and investment in sustainability-focused offerings, we launched Honeywell Forge Sustainability + . The technology provides a foundation for organizations to measure, monitor, reduce, and report their emissions performance against their carbon reduction goals. Additionally, we have established two businesses focused on sustainability offerings: Sustainable Technology Solutions and Sustainable Building Technologies. \n\nSustainable Technology Solutions, a business within our Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment, develops innovative offerings that help support a lower carbon economy. The business focuses on a broad set of solutions that are designed to help lessen the environmental impact of our customers&#8217; end markets both now and in the future. These solutions include renewable fuels, energy storage, blue and green hydrogen, carbon capture, and plastics recycling. \n\nSustainable Building Technologies, a business within our Honeywell Building Technologies reportable business segment, develops innovative offerings to reduce the carbon impact of buildings and enable more energy independent communities, creating healthier spaces for occupants. Leveraging the Honeywell Forge enterprise performance management software solution&#8217;s artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, the business&#8217; Carbon &#38; Energy Management application autonomously identifies and implements energy conservation measures to help drive efficiency, resiliency, and accountability throughout a real estate portfolio. It continuously investigates, analyzes, and optimizes building performance, down to an asset-specific level, measuring critical sustainability-related key performance indicators, including carbon emissions. \n\nAdditional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and strategy is included in our 2022 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report, which can be found on our website (honeywell.com); this report is not incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K. \n\n10 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n\nWe believe a commitment to and investment in human capital management enables better decision-making, helps us build competitive advantage, and furthers our long-term success. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 97,000 (1) employees across 79 countries, 34,000 (1) of whom are in the United States. Human capital management is the key driver of our performance culture, which enables our workforce to respond to the fast-changing needs of our customers. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 , we employed approximately \n\n97,000 EMPLOYEES (1) \n\nAcross \n\n79 COUNTRIES \n\n34,000 (1) \n\nof whom are in the United States. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) and Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) work forces of approximately 22,000 employees. Sandia and KCNSC are U.S. Department of Energy facilities. Honeywell manages these facilities as a contract operator and does not establish or control their human resource policies. \n\nOUR CULTURE \n\nHoneywell has built a reputation of &#8220;doing what we say.&#8221; At the center of that commitment to excellence is a high-performance culture that is rooted in our Foundational Principles and driven by the 8 Honeywell Behaviors. The 8 Behaviors reflect the bold, entrepreneurial spirit we seek to foster while emphasizing our goal to operate with speed and precision. At their foundation is a commitment to Integrity and Ethics, Inclusion and Diversity, and Workplace Respect, fundamental values that underlie everything we do. \n\n11 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program and promotes an environment where everyone is treated ethically and with respect. It outlines our pledge to recognize the dignity of each individual, respect each employee, provide compensation and benefits that are competitive, promote self-development through training, and value diversity of perspectives and ideas. All employees must complete Code of Business Conduct training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. \n\nOverall, we believe our culture, along with our internal tools and initiatives, enable us to effectively execute our human capital strategy. For discussion on the risks relating the ability to attract and retain top-performing talent, please see the section titled Risk Factors. \n\nTALENT ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT \n\nOur internal talent acquisition and management platform is a key component to recruiting, hiring, and developing top-performing talent. Our hiring practices consider a diverse slate of candidates and our hiring managers are provided training and toolkits to reinforce their role in bringing diverse talent into the Company. We apply a &#8220;diversity of slate&#8221; requirement, a requirement to interview at least one diverse candidate, unless an exception is approved by human resources leadership, when hiring for any exempt role in the U.S. or for any management, professional, or senior administrative role globally. Further, we partner with top academic institutions and external professional organizations to enhance the diversity of our workforce to attract and retain top talent. Our talent review process requires our people managers to have semi-annual career discussions with each member of their teams to discuss the best opportunity for growth and development, which enhances our identification of candidates for internal promotion and succession planning. \n\nVOICE OF THE EMPLOYEE \n\nIn 2021, we introduced a Voice of the Employee feedback survey to all employees globally with the commitment to listening, learning, and taking action to make Honeywell an even better place to work. The survey provides data and tools to leaders at all levels to best drive actionable plans around employee engagement and build our desired culture that attracts and retains top talent, improves performance, and distinguishes the Company as a great place to work. The survey is conducted annually in April with a pulse survey in October. \n\nEMPLOYEE WELL-BEING \n\nOur well-being focus addresses physical, mental, financial, and individual needs, providing benefits and resources to help employees and their families be their best, both personally and professionally. We implemented several campaigns to promote well-being and help provide visibility to resources and available benefits. Across the world, mental health is an increasingly important issue, so we created a focused campaign &#8211; Mental Health Awareness Month &#8211; to promote a variety of resources available to support our employees and their families. We offer Employee Assistance Programs or therapy sessions to all employees and family members globally, comprehensive mental health benefits to those enrolled in the U.S. medical plan, virtual mental health options and navigation tools to improve access and speed of care, and preventive/mental health resilience programs. \n\n12 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nABOUT HONEYWELL ##TABLE_END\n\nTRAINING AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT \n\nInvesting in continuous learning and leadership development is at the core of our culture and long-term business growth strategy.

With our global programs, we recruit, develop, retain, and promote diverse talent. We continue to build partnerships with diverse organizations and develop resources to support diverse employees. Our leaders are held accountable to actively support Inclusion and Diversity in words and actions. We further our foundational principle of Inclusion and Diversity by focusing on three key priorities: \n\n##TABLE_START REPRESENTATION RETENTION RECOGNITION Cultivate a workforce that reflects our communities and the world \n\nCreate employee development and advancement opportunities \n\nBe a global employer of choice for Inclusion and Diversity \n\nSustain a pipeline of diverse talent from campus to the C-Suite \n\nFoster community engagement and belonging \n\nLeverage our culture as a competitive advantage \n\nPromote a culture of inclusion, accessibility, and respect \n\nOffer competitive compensation, rewards, and recognition \n\nLead on Inclusion and Diversity practices \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOur commitment to Inclusion and Diversity starts at the top with a diverse Board of Directors and executive management team, who represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. We believe that the diversity of our current Board of Directors (four women, including two African American, one Hispanic, and one Asian American director) and the diversity of Honeywell&#8217;s executive leadership (five of the Company&#8217;s ten executive officers are diverse by ethnic background, non-U.S. place of birth, or gender) supports our evolving business strategy and is a testament to Honeywell&#8217;s ongoing commitment to hiring, developing, and retaining diverse talent. The Company&#8217;s commitment to Inclusion and Diversity enables better decision-making, helps build competitive advantages, and furthers long-term success. \n\nIn 2020, we established a Global Inclusion and Diversity Steering Committee co-sponsored by our Chairman and CEO, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and fortified our inclusion and diversity governance structure by embedding Inclusion and Diversity Councils in each of our business groups. The governance structure provides a scalable model that supports our nine affinity group employee networks and facilitates the introduction of new networks to reflect the diverse characteristics of our workforce. These networks are designed to provide training and development opportunities and expand internal networks for promotional opportunities. \n\nEMPLOYEE NETWORKS \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nHoneywell All Abilities Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Hispanic Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Asian Employee Network \n\nHoneywell LGBTQ+ Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Black Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Veteran's Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Early Career Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Women&#8217;s Employee Network \n\nHoneywell Experienced Career Employee Network ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022, we dedicated the month of April to shaping an inclusive future with the first-ever Global Inclusion and Diversity month.

All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nA detailed discussion of the prior year 2021 to 2020 year-over-year changes is not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 1 1 , 202 2 . \n\nBUSINESS UPDATE \n\nIn July 2022, we realigned certain business units within the Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. The Safety and Retail business unit, which included our gas detection and safety business, combined with the Advanced Sensing Technologies business unit to form the Sensing and Safety Technologies business unit. This realignment provides opportunities to capitalize on shared synergies and core technologies resulting in greater value for our customers and the markets we serve. We recast historical periods to reflect this realignment. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The bill includes numerous tax provisions, including a 15% corporate minimum tax as well as a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. We continue to evaluate the impact of this law on our operations; at this point, the legislation is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS \n\nThroughout 2022 and continuing into 2023, the global economy experienced and continues to experience significant supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and inflationary cost pressures. \n\nLabor shortages continue to place a strain on our operations and the operations of our suppliers, creating challenges in procurement of materials and delivering products and services to our customers. In addition, in certain regions of Asia, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations and our customers' and suppliers' ability to operate at normal levels. We anticipate supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue into 2023, and in response have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to mitigate the impact. \n\nMitigation strategies include pricing actions, material supply tracking tools, refinement of escalation processes to communicate supply shortages, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Where we cannot procure key components or raw materials, we redesigned existing products or developed new products to satisfy current and changing demand where feasible. Redesigned products, or the development of new products, undergo product quality controls and engineering qualification prior to releasing to our customers. Further, our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source key components and raw materials. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. Additionally, due to the strenuous quality controls and product qualification we perform on new or redesigned products, we do not expect these mitigation strategies to impact product quality or reliability. \n\nDuring 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict introduced volatility in global financial and energy markets, increasing energy costs and exacerbating existing supply chain constraints, which added to the inflationary pressures in the global economy. We continue to actively work with our suppliers to minimize impacts of supply shortages on our manufacturing capabilities, and we implemented strategies to reduce our reliance on natural gas at critical sites in Europe. \n\nIf we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. \n\nSee the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain constraints, and labor shortages to our businesses. \n\n16 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nSee the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages to our businesses. \n\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT \n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in February 2022, continues to negatively impact our businesses and operations and drive global economic and political uncertainty. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022, we suspended substantially all of our sales, distribution, and service activities in Russia and Belarus (the Suspension). In June 2022, we approved a plan to wind down our existing businesses and operations in Russia (the Wind down). During September and October 2022, we completed the sale of three entities domiciled in Russia. For our two remaining entities, we are pursuing a voluntary liquidation strategy to completely exit our businesses and operations in Russia. The Suspension and Wind down impacts all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact to our Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. \n\nIn light of the humanitarian crisis created by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we remain focused on efforts to assist and support our employees and their families impacted by the conflict. In March 2022, we created a Ukraine Relief Fund, allowing employees to make donations to support organizations providing direct assistance to Ukrainians and those that are assisting them in the midst of this humanitarian crisis. Additionally, as the conflict began, we accelerated payroll payments to those affected by the conflict and our initial Suspension of our operations. \n\nThe impacts of the initial Suspension and Wind down to revenue, net income, net assets, or cash flow from operations for the periods recognized are not material to our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from sales in Russia represented approximately 1% of our global revenues, and assets in Russia represented less than 1% of our total assets. Our estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the Suspension and Wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to our Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to our consolidated financial position. As the conflict evolves, existing conditions may worsen or other impacts that are unknown at this time may arise that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. \n\nSee the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to our businesses. \n\nSee Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of our Russian entities and charges recognized related to the Suspension and Wind down, respectively. \n\nSee the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on potential risks to our business related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \n\n17 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nConsolidated Financial Results \n\nNet Sales by Segment \n\n18 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nSegment Profit by Segment \n\n19 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS \n\nNet Sales \n\nThe change in net sales was attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START 2022 Versus 2021 \n\n2021 Versus 2020 \n\nVolume (4) % 1 % Price 10 % 3 % Foreign currency translation (3) % 1 % Acquisitions, divestitures, and other, net &#8212; % &#8212; % Total % change in Net sales 3 &#160; % 5 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nA discussion of net sales by reportable business segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management Discussion and Analysis. \n\nNet sales increased due to the following: \n\n&#8226; Increased pricing, \n\n&#8226; Partially offset by lower sales volumes, and \n\n&#8226; The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets, primarily the Euro, British Pound, Turkish Lira, Chinese Renminbi, and Australian Dollar. \n\nReconciliation of Reported Sales % Change to Organic Sales % Change and Organic Sales % Change Excluding Lost Russian Sales \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Versus 2021 \n\n2021 Versus 2020 \n\nTotal Reported % change in Net sales 3 &#160; % 5 &#160; % Less: Foreign currency translation (3) % 1 % Less: Acquisitions, divestitures, and other, net &#8212; % &#8212; % \n\nTotal Organic (1) % change in Net sales \n\n6 &#160; % 4 &#160; % \n\nLess: Sales decline attributable to lost Russian sales (2) \n\n(1) % &#8212; % Total Organic % change excluding lost Russian sales 7 &#160; % 4 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Organic sales % change, presented for all of our reportable business segments, is defined as the change in net sales, excluding the impact on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, for the first 12 months following the transaction date. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and management in understanding the ongoing operations and analysis of ongoing operating trends. \n\n(2) Lost Russian sales is defined as the year-over-year decline in sales due to the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. This does not reflect management&#8217;s estimate of 2022 Russian sales absent the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia . \n\n20 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nCost of Products and Services Sold \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nCost of products and services sold increased in 2022 primarily due to the following: \n\n&#8226;

Tax expense from restructuring, incremental tax reserves, and state taxes, representing a 320 basis-point increase, \n\n&#8226; Offset by benefits received from employee share-based payments and tax credits, representing a 210 basis-point decrease. \n\nFor further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nEarnings per share of common stock&#8211;assuming dilution decreased primarily due to the following: \n\n&#8226; Higher repositioning and other charges, including charges and accrual of reserves directly attributable to the initial Suspension and Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia and net charges for the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale, impacted earnings per share by $0.86 after tax, and \n\n&#8226;

Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of a global pandemic, which impacted our operating results in 2022. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. \n\n&#8226; Honeywell Building Technologies &#8212;Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. \n\n&#8226; Performance Materials and Technologies &#8212;Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers&#8217; availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities&#8217; production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services. \n\n&#8226; Safety and Productivity Solutions &#8212;Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins. \n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations. \n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company&#8217;s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. \n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. \n\n29 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe U.S. continues to implement certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs, export controls and sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. \n\nIn response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries imposed actions including sanctions, export and import controls, and trade restrictions with respect to Russian and Belarusian governments, government-related entities, and other entities and individuals. Further, the Russian government implemented retaliatory actions against the U.S. and other nation members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as certain other nations. As a result of these governmental actions, in March 2022, we suspended substantially all of our sales, distribution, and service activities in Russia and Belarus (the Suspension), and in June 2022, we decided to wind down our existing businesses and operations in Russia (the Wind down). Given the uncertainty inherent in our remaining obligations related to our contracts with Russian counterparties, we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Based on available information to date, the Company's estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the Suspension and Wind down activities, including guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to our Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. As the conflict continues to evolve, existing conditions may worsen, or other impacts, including escalation of the conflict in other regions of Europe where there is a material portion of our business, increased tension between Russia and the U.S. and other NATO members and other countries, or other impacts that are unknown at this time, could lead to increased charges and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. These impacts may result in increased costs or additional impacts on our operations and may adversely affect our ability to meet contractual and financial obligations, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nTo the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates, it may also negatively impact other risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K and further impact our financial results. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending; cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or that of our customers and suppliers, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly in Eastern Europe and surrounding regions; disruptions in global supply chains; energy shortages; terrorist activities targeting U.S. government contractors and/or critical infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. \n\nOperating outside of the U.S. also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the U.S. that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. \n\nOperating outside the U.S. also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results. \n\nRisks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. \n\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses, which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. \n\n30 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nRaw material price fluctuations, inflation, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. \n\nThe cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). As of December 31, 2022, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies had 79% and 66%, respectively, of raw materials supply base under contract. Due to supply chain constraints and labor shortages, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been recent shortages of and inflationary trends in the cost of raw materials, including increases in labor and freight costs, for the transportation of raw materials. Any inability to source necessary materials when and as needed, offset material price or labor inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-driven or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions, or commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nMany major components, product equipment items, and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases, in addition to other supply chain disruptions, may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers&#8217; inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. In addition, current or future global economic uncertainty, including volatile financial markets, geopolitical instability, potential recession, and other events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect the financial stability of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. If one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays, or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. \n\nIn an effort to reduce the impact of current and future supply chain disruptions, we have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to reduce the impact of such disruptions, including development of new or redesigned products that satisfy our product quality controls and engineering qualifications and/or any applicable regulatory requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that our mitigation strategies will continue to be successful, or that we will be able to alter our strategies or develop new strategies if and as needed. \n\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. \n\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. \n\nOur future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. \n\nOur future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture, and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand; and (ix) attract, develop, and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers&#8217; needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. \n\n31 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nFailure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. \n\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, and results of operations. \n\nAs a supplier to the U.S. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. \n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to congressional funding, which may be unavailable due to changes in priorities or subject to continuing resolution, which may result in funding reductions, eliminations, or other effects that could impact our business. \n\nWe are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment, or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings, and/or have its export privileges suspended. \n\nOur operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. \n\nMainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local, and foreign governments regulate the use of certain materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment, implementation of operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\n32 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. \n\nCybersecurity is a critical component of the Company&#8217;s enterprise risk management program. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers, and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents (against us or parties with whom we contract), depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), theft of funds, and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident and its effects include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. \n\nThe development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks. \n\nAn increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. \n\nData privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks. \n\nWe collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other states and countries have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage, and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial statements. \n\n33 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nA material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. \n\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or other disruptions, including hurricanes and floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, including water scarcity, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which has negatively impacted our operations and adversely affected our business and could continue to do so. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages and energy shortages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. In addition, the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption, including those resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather event, and recurring extreme weather events or other adverse events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. \n\nConcentrations of credit, counterparty and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe maintain long-term contractual relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks of such counterparties, including those concentrated in the same or similar industries and geographic regions. Changes in political and economic conditions could also lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties and their ability to pay in the same or similar industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contractual arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Among other factors, changes in economic conditions, including an economic downturn or recession, could also result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty. \n\nWe are impacted by increasing stakeholder interest in public company performance, disclosure, and goal-setting with respect to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. \n\nIn response to growing customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our ESG practices, including our procedures, standards, performance metrics, and goals, we have increased reporting of our ESG programs and performance and have established and announced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. These goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to ESG initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (i) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (ii) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (iii) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards, (iv) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, and (v) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting of ESG matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our performance metrics, goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, certain of our products and services, including offerings in our Defense and Space business unit, are unattractive to certain investors and may cause us to be increasingly subject to ESG-driven investment practices that preclude investment in our debt and equity. \n\nIf our ESG practices or business portfolio do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, supplier, business partner, or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. \n\nGlobal climate change and related regulations and changes in customer demand could negatively affect our operations and our business. \n\nThe effects of climate change could create financial risks to our business. For example, the effects of physical impacts of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, exacerbate existing risks to our supply chain, disrupt our operations, and increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. \n\n34 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe growing focus on addressing global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more customer demand for products and services that have a lower carbon footprint or that help businesses and consumers reduce carbon emissions throughout their value chains. These regulations tend to be implemented under global, national and sub-national climate objectives or policies, and target the global warming potential of refrigerants, energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Although we offer and continue to invest in developing solutions that help our customers meet their carbon reduction and sustainability goals, many of our products combust fossil fuels, consume energy, and use refrigerants. Regulations and carbon reduction goals which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could reduce demand for such products and present a risk to our business. We may be required to further increase research and development and other capital expenditures in order to develop offerings that meet these new regulations, standards, and customer demands. There can be no assurance that our new product development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development. \n\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS \n\nOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as changes in tax law or regulation. \n\nOur future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures, and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. \n\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. \n\nThe sales and margins of each of our reportable business segments are directly impacted by government regulations, including environmental, safety, performance, and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Aviation Original Equipment and Commercial Aviation Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental, and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies&#8217; results of operations can be impacted by environmental and health standards, regulations, and judicial determinations, including potential per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) legislation and regulations that, if adopted, could impact the sale of certain products in our Advanced Materials business, without fully assessing level of risk or environmental impact. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Changes in such regulations and government policies could negatively impact us; for instance, noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures. \n\nIncreased focus and evolving views of lawmakers climate change and other environmental, social and governance issues could have long-term impact on our business and result of operations. \n\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change and other ESG matters may result in more international, regional and/or federal regulatory or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, more prescriptive reporting of ESG metrics, practices and targets, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate and other ESG legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, there has been an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity, particularly in the European Union, United Kingdom, and U.S. New or revised legal and regulatory requirements could impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, and could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position. \n\n35 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. \n\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health, and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and financial condition. \n\n36 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS \n\nInformation relating to market risks is included within Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Form 10-K under the caption &#8220;Financial Instruments.&#8221; \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions) \n\nWe continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. Additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets, U.S. cash balances, and the ability to access non-U.S. cash balances. \n\nCASH \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we held $10.1 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, $5.0 billion of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by non-US subsidiaries. We do not have material amounts related to any jurisdiction subject to currency control restrictions that impact our ability to access and repatriate such amounts. Under current laws, we do not expect taxes on repatriation or restrictions on amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity. \n\nBORROWINGS \n\nWe leverage a variety of debt instruments to manage our overall borrowing costs. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, our total borrowings were $19.6 billion. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings $ 2,717 $ 3,542 Variable rate notes 22 622 Fixed rate notes 17,086 15,314 Other 265 272 Fair value of hedging instruments (287) 60 Debt issuance costs (233) (211) Total borrowings $ 19,570 &#160; $ 19,599 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nA primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the corporate bond markets. Through these markets, we issue a variety of long-term fixed rate notes, in a variety of currencies, to manage our overall funding costs. \n\nAnother primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding was 3.29% and 0.07% as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\n37 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nWe also have the following revolving credit agreements: \n\n&#8226; A $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 24, 2022. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 23, 2023, unless (i) we elect to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 23, 2024, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the previously reported $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated March 31, 2021, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 24, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement. \n\n&#8226; A $4.0 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 24, 2022. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The 5-Year Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously reported $4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-Year Credit Agreement. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. \n\nCREDIT RATINGS \n\nOur ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, S&#38;P Global Inc. (S&#38;P), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), and Moody&#8217;s Investor Service (Moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START S&#38;P Fitch Moody's Outlook Stable Stable Stable Short-term A-1 F1 P1 Long-term A A A2 ##TABLE_END\n\nCASH FLOW SUMMARY \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2022 \n\nvs. \n\n2020 Change \n\nvs. \n\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 10,959 $ 14,275 $ (3,316) $ 9,067 $ 5,208 Operating activities Net income attributable to Honeywell 4,966 5,542 (576) 4,779 763 Noncash adjustments 1,946 971 975 1,284 (313) Changes in working capital (1,334) 51 (1,385) 617 (566) Other operating activities (304) (526) 222 (472) (54) Net cash provided by operating activities 5,274 6,038 (764) 6,208 (170) Net cash used for investing activities (93) (1,061) 968 (987) (74) Net cash used for financing activities (6,330) (8,254) 1,924 (81) (8,173) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (183) (39) (144) 68 (107) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1,332) (3,316) 1,984 5,208 (8,524) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 9,627 &#160; $ 10,959 &#160; $ (1,332) $ 14,275 &#160; $ (3,316) ##TABLE_END\n\n38 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nCash related to operating activities decreased by $764 million primarily due to an unfavorable impact to working capital. Working capital declined by $1,385 million, led by decreases in Accounts payable of $899 million, primarily due to a decrease in purchases of materials driven by lower sales volumes and a decrease in days payables outstanding, and increases in Accounts receivable of $731 million, primarily due to revenue growth mainly as a result of pricing actions. Operating cash flow was further reduced by the decrease in Net income attributable to Honeywell, partially offset by higher noncash adjustments for repositioning and other net charges for the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale and charges related to the initial Suspension and Wind down of our business and operations in Russia, and a decrease in pension and other postretirement income. \n\nCash related to investing activities increased by $968 million primarily due to a $1,148 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. \n\nCash related to financing activities increased by $1,924 million primarily due to a $3,067 million decrease in the payments of long-term debt and $436 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by a $820 million increase in repurchases of common stock and $790 million decrease in the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. \n\nCASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2023 to be as follows: \n\n&#8226; Capital expenditures&#8212;we expect to spend approximately $1.0 billion for capital expenditures in 2023 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, implementation of cost reduction measures, maintenance, and replacement. \n\n&#8226; Share repurchases&#8212;under our share repurchase program, $2.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2022, for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. \n\n&#8226; Dividends&#8212;we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $1.03 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2022 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. \n\nWe continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. In addition, multiple third-party financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain financing (SCF) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. We agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure from our suppliers, including prices, quantities, and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Our suppliers&#8217; voluntary participation in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms and we have no economic interest in a supplier&#8217;s decision to participate in the SCF program. \n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2022, Accounts payable included approximately $700 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. Amounts settled with third-party financial institutions through the SCF program increased approximately $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, ref lects a combination of an ext ension of payment terms with suppliers and increased utilization of our SCF program. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While access to SCF could decrease if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not believe that changes in the availability of SCF will have a significant impact on our liquidity. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. \n\nWe sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. Transfers of the receivables are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold are excluded from Accounts receivable&#8212;net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the cash received is recorded in Cost of products and services sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. \n\nFinally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit, and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability, or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. \n\n39 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nIn early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.5 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. During 2023, and pursuant to the NARCO Amended Buyout Agreement, we expect to receive approximately $295 million related to the HWI Sale. We believe these payments and receipts will not materially impact our liquidity position. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. \n\nSee Note 9 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Total (6)(7) \n\nPayments by Period Thereafter 2023 2024 - 2025 \n\n2026 - 2027 \n\nLong-term debt, including finance leases (1) \n\n$ 16,853 $ 1,730 $ 3,059 $ 2,523 $ 9,541 Interest payments on long-term debt, including finance leases 4,523 472 844 738 2,469 Operating lease liabilities 1,080 208 315 203 354 \n\nPurchase obligations (2) \n\n2,844 1,453 962 283 146 \n\nEstimated environmental liability payments (3) \n\n615 222 201 171 21 \n\nAsbestos-related liability payments (4) \n\n1,291 111 204 178 798 \n\nAsbestos insurance recoveries (5) \n\n(130) (18) (29) (21) (62) &#160; $ 27,076 &#160; $ 4,178 &#160; $ 5,556 &#160; $ 4,075 &#160; $ 13,267 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n(2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n(3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2022. \n\n(4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos-related cash payments for Bendix based on our asbestos-related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2022. Amounts exclude payments made in January 2023 in connection with the NARCO Buyout. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos-related liabilities as of December 31, 2022. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Resideo. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nASBESTOS MATTERS \n\nPayments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $166 million, $240 million, and $229 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $133 million in 2023. We expect to make payments associated with these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. In early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.3 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout. For additional information regarding the NARCO Buyout, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n40 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS \n\nAccruals during the year for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $186 million, $168 million, and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $71 million, $88 million, and $88 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nPayments related to known environmental matters were $211 million, $210 million, and $216 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $222 million in 2023. We expect to make payments associated with these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreement with other parties. \n\nReimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2022 and are expected to be $140 million in 2023. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. \n\n41 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#8212;We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation&#8217;s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing, and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\nIncome Taxes &#8212;On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes, and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. \n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. We assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. \n\nFor further discussion of additional income tax policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n43 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing &#8212;Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. \n\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets &#8212;The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#8226; Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#8226; Significant negative industry or economic trends; or \n\n&#8226; Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#8212;We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense), and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate: &#160; &#160; &#160; Projected benefit obligation 2.87 % 2.50 % 3.22 % Service cost 2.98 % 2.68 % 3.33 % Interest cost 2.26 % 1.76 % 2.76 % Assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; Expected rate of return 6.40 % 6.15 % 6.15 % Actual rate of return (10.45) % 6.84 % 13.81 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 8.77 % 11.37 % 10.64 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans&#8217; projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM Adjustments were expenses of $523 million, $40 million, and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n44 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END\n\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of f uture market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2023, which is an increase in the assumption used for 2022. \n\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 5.17% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future Pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Pension \n\nOngoing Expense \n\nImpact on Projected Benefit Obligation 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $16 million Increase $310 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $15 million Decrease $296 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $41 million &#8212; 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $41 million &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nPension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $545 million in 2023 compared with Pension ongoing income of $993 million in 2022. The expected decrease in pension income is due to changes in market conditions over the course of 2022. Significantly higher discount rates globally have increased the interest cost on the plan obligations, while decreasing asset values in plans, reducing the expected return generated by the plan assets. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2023, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nAsbestos-Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries &#8212;The recognition of asbestos-related liabilities relates to a predecessor company, Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix). For Bendix asbestos-related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrue for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which was considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos-related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#8217;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#8212;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal, and environmental, health, and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation, and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions, or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#8217;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. \n\n45 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLITIGATION \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos, and other litigation matters. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n46 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n\nThe executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. \n\nThe number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2022, was 37,527. \n\nInformation regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in the section titled Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption &#8220;Equity Compensation Plans.&#8221; \n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. \n\nRepurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which could include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase transactions, negotiated block transactions, 10b5-1 plans, other transactions that may be structured through investment banking institutions or privately negotiated, or a combination of the foregoing. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time (i) to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting, and matching contributions under our savings plans, and (ii) to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. \n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Honeywell purchased 6,783,496 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share. As of December 31, 2022, $2.9 billion remained available for additional share repurchases.

All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nA detailed discussion of the prior year 2021 to 2020 year-over-year changes is not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 1 1 , 202 2 . \n\nBUSINESS UPDATE \n\nIn July 2022, we realigned certain business units within the Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. The Safety and Retail business unit, which included our gas detection and safety business, combined with the Advanced Sensing Technologies business unit to form the Sensing and Safety Technologies business unit. This realignment provides opportunities to capitalize on shared synergies and core technologies resulting in greater value for our customers and the markets we serve. We recast historical periods to reflect this realignment. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The bill includes numerous tax provisions, including a 15% corporate minimum tax as well as a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. We continue to evaluate the impact of this law on our operations; at this point, the legislation is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS \n\nThroughout 2022 and continuing into 2023, the global economy experienced and continues to experience significant supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and inflationary cost pressures. \n\nLabor shortages continue to place a strain on our operations and the operations of our suppliers, creating challenges in procurement of materials and delivering products and services to our customers. In addition, in certain regions of Asia, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations and our customers' and suppliers' ability to operate at normal levels. We anticipate supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue into 2023, and in response have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to mitigate the impact. \n\nMitigation strategies include pricing actions, material supply tracking tools, refinement of escalation processes to communicate supply shortages, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Where we cannot procure key components or raw materials, we redesigned existing products or developed new products to satisfy current and changing demand where feasible. Redesigned products, or the development of new products, undergo product quality controls and engineering qualification prior to releasing to our customers. Further, our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source key components and raw materials. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. Additionally, due to the strenuous quality controls and product qualification we perform on new or redesigned products, we do not expect these mitigation strategies to impact product quality or reliability. \n\nDuring 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict introduced volatility in global financial and energy markets, increasing energy costs and exacerbating existing supply chain constraints, which added to the inflationary pressures in the global economy. We continue to actively work with our suppliers to minimize impacts of supply shortages on our manufacturing capabilities, and we implemented strategies to reduce our reliance on natural gas at critical sites in Europe. \n\nIf we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. \n\nSee the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain constraints, and labor shortages to our businesses. \n\n16 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nSee the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages to our businesses. \n\nRUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT \n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in February 2022, continues to negatively impact our businesses and operations and drive global economic and political uncertainty. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022, we suspended substantially all of our sales, distribution, and service activities in Russia and Belarus (the Suspension). In June 2022, we approved a plan to wind down our existing businesses and operations in Russia (the Wind down). During September and October 2022, we completed the sale of three entities domiciled in Russia. For our two remaining entities, we are pursuing a voluntary liquidation strategy to completely exit our businesses and operations in Russia. The Suspension and Wind down impacts all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact to our Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. \n\nIn light of the humanitarian crisis created by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we remain focused on efforts to assist and support our employees and their families impacted by the conflict. In March 2022, we created a Ukraine Relief Fund, allowing employees to make donations to support organizations providing direct assistance to Ukrainians and those that are assisting them in the midst of this humanitarian crisis. Additionally, as the conflict began, we accelerated payroll payments to those affected by the conflict and our initial Suspension of our operations. \n\nThe impacts of the initial Suspension and Wind down to revenue, net income, net assets, or cash flow from operations for the periods recognized are not material to our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from sales in Russia represented approximately 1% of our global revenues, and assets in Russia represented less than 1% of our total assets. Our estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the Suspension and Wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to our Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to our consolidated financial position. As the conflict evolves, existing conditions may worsen or other impacts that are unknown at this time may arise that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. \n\nSee the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to our businesses. \n\nSee Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of our Russian entities and charges recognized related to the Suspension and Wind down, respectively. \n\nSee the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on potential risks to our business related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \n\n17 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nConsolidated Financial Results \n\nNet Sales by Segment \n\n18 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nSegment Profit by Segment \n\n19 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS \n\nNet Sales \n\nThe change in net sales was attributable to the following: ##TABLE_START 2022 Versus 2021 \n\n2021 Versus 2020 \n\nVolume (4) % 1 % Price 10 % 3 % Foreign currency translation (3) % 1 % Acquisitions, divestitures, and other, net &#8212; % &#8212; % Total % change in Net sales 3 &#160; % 5 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nA discussion of net sales by reportable business segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management Discussion and Analysis. \n\nNet sales increased due to the following: \n\n&#8226; Increased pricing, \n\n&#8226; Partially offset by lower sales volumes, and \n\n&#8226; The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets, primarily the Euro, British Pound, Turkish Lira, Chinese Renminbi, and Australian Dollar. \n\nReconciliation of Reported Sales % Change to Organic Sales % Change and Organic Sales % Change Excluding Lost Russian Sales \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Versus 2021 \n\n2021 Versus 2020 \n\nTotal Reported % change in Net sales 3 &#160; % 5 &#160; % Less: Foreign currency translation (3) % 1 % Less: Acquisitions, divestitures, and other, net &#8212; % &#8212; % \n\nTotal Organic (1) % change in Net sales \n\n6 &#160; % 4 &#160; % \n\nLess: Sales decline attributable to lost Russian sales (2) \n\n(1) % &#8212; % Total Organic % change excluding lost Russian sales 7 &#160; % 4 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Organic sales % change, presented for all of our reportable business segments, is defined as the change in net sales, excluding the impact on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, for the first 12 months following the transaction date. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and management in understanding the ongoing operations and analysis of ongoing operating trends. \n\n(2) Lost Russian sales is defined as the year-over-year decline in sales due to the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. This does not reflect management&#8217;s estimate of 2022 Russian sales absent the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia . \n\n20 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nCost of Products and Services Sold \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nCost of products and services sold increased in 2022 primarily due to the following: \n\n&#8226;

Tax expense from restructuring, incremental tax reserves, and state taxes, representing a 320 basis-point increase, \n\n&#8226; Offset by benefits received from employee share-based payments and tax credits, representing a 210 basis-point decrease. \n\nFor further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nNet Income Attributable to Honeywell \n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nEarnings per share of common stock&#8211;assuming dilution decreased primarily due to the following: \n\n&#8226; Higher repositioning and other charges, including charges and accrual of reserves directly attributable to the initial Suspension and Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia and net charges for the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale, impacted earnings per share by $0.86 after tax, and \n\n&#8226; Higher pension mark-to-market expense and lower pension income impacted earnings per share by $0.69 after tax, \n\n&#8226; Partially offset by higher segment profit from our reportable business segments impacted earnings per share by $0.53 after tax. \n\n23 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nREVIEW OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS \n\nWe globally manage our business operations through four reportable business segments: Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. \n\nAEROSPACE \n\nNet Sales \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Change \n\nvs. \n\n2020 Change \n\nvs. \n\nNet sales $ 11,827 $ 11,026 7 % $ 11,544 (4) % Cost of products and services sold 7,747 7,191 &#160;

Corporate and All Other is not a separate reportable business segment as segment reporting criteria is not met for the activities reported with Corporate and All Other and the Company does not believe the results of operations are meaningful to investors. The Company continues to monitor the activities in Corporate and All Other to determine the need for further reportable business segment disaggregation. \n\nREPOSITIONING CHARGES \n\nSee Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2022, 2021, and 2020. We recognized higher Total net repositioning and other charges in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the recognition of Asbestos-related charges, net of insurance and reimbursements related to the North American Refractory Company (NARCO) Buyout and HarbisonWalker International Holdings, Inc. (HWI) Sale, and Other charges related to the initial Suspension and Wind down of our business and operations in Russia. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $275 million, $382 million, and $564 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and was funded through operating cash flows. \n\n28 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nRISK FACTORS \n\nOur business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition are subject to the material risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. \n\nMACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS \n\nEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Aerospace &#8212;Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of a global pandemic, which impacted our operating results in 2022. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. \n\n&#8226; Honeywell Building Technologies &#8212;Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. \n\n&#8226; Performance Materials and Technologies &#8212;Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers&#8217; availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities&#8217; production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services. \n\n&#8226; Safety and Productivity Solutions &#8212;Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins. \n\nA significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations. \n\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company&#8217;s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. \n\nExisting free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. \n\n29 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe U.S. continues to implement certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs, export controls and sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. \n\nIn response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries imposed actions including sanctions, export and import controls, and trade restrictions with respect to Russian and Belarusian governments, government-related entities, and other entities and individuals. Further, the Russian government implemented retaliatory actions against the U.S. and other nation members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as certain other nations. As a result of these governmental actions, in March 2022, we suspended substantially all of our sales, distribution, and service activities in Russia and Belarus (the Suspension), and in June 2022, we decided to wind down our existing businesses and operations in Russia (the Wind down). Given the uncertainty inherent in our remaining obligations related to our contracts with Russian counterparties, we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Based on available information to date, the Company's estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the Suspension and Wind down activities, including guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to our Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. As the conflict continues to evolve, existing conditions may worsen, or other impacts, including escalation of the conflict in other regions of Europe where there is a material portion of our business, increased tension between Russia and the U.S. and other NATO members and other countries, or other impacts that are unknown at this time, could lead to increased charges and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. These impacts may result in increased costs or additional impacts on our operations and may adversely affect our ability to meet contractual and financial obligations, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nTo the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates, it may also negatively impact other risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K and further impact our financial results. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending; cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or that of our customers and suppliers, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly in Eastern Europe and surrounding regions; disruptions in global supply chains; energy shortages; terrorist activities targeting U.S. government contractors and/or critical infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. \n\nOperating outside of the U.S. also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the U.S. that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. \n\nOperating outside the U.S. also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results. \n\nRisks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. \n\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses, which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. \n\n30 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nRaw material price fluctuations, inflation, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. \n\nThe cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). As of December 31, 2022, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies had 79% and 66%, respectively, of raw materials supply base under contract. Due to supply chain constraints and labor shortages, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been recent shortages of and inflationary trends in the cost of raw materials, including increases in labor and freight costs, for the transportation of raw materials. Any inability to source necessary materials when and as needed, offset material price or labor inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-driven or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions, or commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nMany major components, product equipment items, and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases, in addition to other supply chain disruptions, may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers&#8217; inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. In addition, current or future global economic uncertainty, including volatile financial markets, geopolitical instability, potential recession, and other events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect the financial stability of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. If one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays, or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. \n\nIn an effort to reduce the impact of current and future supply chain disruptions, we have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to reduce the impact of such disruptions, including development of new or redesigned products that satisfy our product quality controls and engineering qualifications and/or any applicable regulatory requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that our mitigation strategies will continue to be successful, or that we will be able to alter our strategies or develop new strategies if and as needed. \n\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. \n\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. \n\nOur future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. \n\nOur future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture, and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand; and (ix) attract, develop, and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers&#8217; needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. \n\n31 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nFailure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. \n\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, and results of operations. \n\nAs a supplier to the U.S. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. \n\nU.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to congressional funding, which may be unavailable due to changes in priorities or subject to continuing resolution, which may result in funding reductions, eliminations, or other effects that could impact our business. \n\nWe are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment, or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings, and/or have its export privileges suspended. \n\nOur operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. \n\nMainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local, and foreign governments regulate the use of certain materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment, implementation of operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \n\n32 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. \n\nCybersecurity is a critical component of the Company&#8217;s enterprise risk management program. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers, and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents (against us or parties with whom we contract), depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), theft of funds, and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident and its effects include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. \n\nThe development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks. \n\nAn increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. \n\nData privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks. \n\nWe collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other states and countries have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage, and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial statements. \n\n33 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nA material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. \n\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or other disruptions, including hurricanes and floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, including water scarcity, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which has negatively impacted our operations and adversely affected our business and could continue to do so. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages and energy shortages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. In addition, the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption, including those resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather event, and recurring extreme weather events or other adverse events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. \n\nConcentrations of credit, counterparty and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe maintain long-term contractual relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks of such counterparties, including those concentrated in the same or similar industries and geographic regions. Changes in political and economic conditions could also lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties and their ability to pay in the same or similar industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contractual arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Among other factors, changes in economic conditions, including an economic downturn or recession, could also result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty. \n\nWe are impacted by increasing stakeholder interest in public company performance, disclosure, and goal-setting with respect to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. \n\nIn response to growing customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our ESG practices, including our procedures, standards, performance metrics, and goals, we have increased reporting of our ESG programs and performance and have established and announced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. These goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to ESG initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (i) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (ii) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (iii) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards, (iv) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, and (v) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting of ESG matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our performance metrics, goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, certain of our products and services, including offerings in our Defense and Space business unit, are unattractive to certain investors and may cause us to be increasingly subject to ESG-driven investment practices that preclude investment in our debt and equity. \n\nIf our ESG practices or business portfolio do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, supplier, business partner, or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. \n\nGlobal climate change and related regulations and changes in customer demand could negatively affect our operations and our business. \n\nThe effects of climate change could create financial risks to our business. For example, the effects of physical impacts of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, exacerbate existing risks to our supply chain, disrupt our operations, and increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. \n\n34 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe growing focus on addressing global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more customer demand for products and services that have a lower carbon footprint or that help businesses and consumers reduce carbon emissions throughout their value chains. These regulations tend to be implemented under global, national and sub-national climate objectives or policies, and target the global warming potential of refrigerants, energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Although we offer and continue to invest in developing solutions that help our customers meet their carbon reduction and sustainability goals, many of our products combust fossil fuels, consume energy, and use refrigerants. Regulations and carbon reduction goals which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could reduce demand for such products and present a risk to our business. We may be required to further increase research and development and other capital expenditures in order to develop offerings that meet these new regulations, standards, and customer demands. There can be no assurance that our new product development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development. \n\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS \n\nOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as changes in tax law or regulation. \n\nOur future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures, and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. \n\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. \n\nThe sales and margins of each of our reportable business segments are directly impacted by government regulations, including environmental, safety, performance, and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Aviation Original Equipment and Commercial Aviation Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental, and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies&#8217; results of operations can be impacted by environmental and health standards, regulations, and judicial determinations, including potential per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) legislation and regulations that, if adopted, could impact the sale of certain products in our Advanced Materials business, without fully assessing level of risk or environmental impact. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Changes in such regulations and government policies could negatively impact us; for instance, noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures. \n\nIncreased focus and evolving views of lawmakers climate change and other environmental, social and governance issues could have long-term impact on our business and result of operations. \n\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change and other ESG matters may result in more international, regional and/or federal regulatory or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, more prescriptive reporting of ESG metrics, practices and targets, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate and other ESG legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, there has been an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity, particularly in the European Union, United Kingdom, and U.S. New or revised legal and regulatory requirements could impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, and could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position. \n\n35 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nRISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. \n\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health, and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and financial condition. \n\n36 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n"

      "text": "\n\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS \n\nInformation relating to market risks is included within Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Form 10-K under the caption &#8220;Financial Instruments.&#8221; \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions) \n\nWe continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. Additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets, U.S. cash balances, and the ability to access non-U.S. cash balances. \n\nCASH \n\nWe monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we held $10.1 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, $5.0 billion of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by non-US subsidiaries. We do not have material amounts related to any jurisdiction subject to currency control restrictions that impact our ability to access and repatriate such amounts. Under current laws, we do not expect taxes on repatriation or restrictions on amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity. \n\nBORROWINGS \n\nWe leverage a variety of debt instruments to manage our overall borrowing costs. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, our total borrowings were $19.6 billion. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings $ 2,717 $ 3,542 Variable rate notes 22 622 Fixed rate notes 17,086 15,314 Other 265 272 Fair value of hedging instruments (287) 60 Debt issuance costs (233) (211) Total borrowings $ 19,570 &#160; $ 19,599 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nA primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the corporate bond markets. Through these markets, we issue a variety of long-term fixed rate notes, in a variety of currencies, to manage our overall funding costs. \n\nAnother primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding was 3.29% and 0.07% as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\n37 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nWe also have the following revolving credit agreements: \n\n&#8226; A $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 24, 2022. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 23, 2023, unless (i) we elect to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 23, 2024, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the previously reported $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated March 31, 2021, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 24, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement. \n\n&#8226; A $4.0 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 24, 2022. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The 5-Year Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously reported $4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-Year Credit Agreement. \n\nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. \n\nCREDIT RATINGS \n\nOur ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, S&#38;P Global Inc. (S&#38;P), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), and Moody&#8217;s Investor Service (Moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START S&#38;P Fitch Moody's Outlook Stable Stable Stable Short-term A-1 F1 P1 Long-term A A A2 ##TABLE_END\n\nCASH FLOW SUMMARY \n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2022 \n\nvs. \n\n2020 Change \n\nvs. \n\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 10,959 $ 14,275 $ (3,316) $ 9,067 $ 5,208 Operating activities Net income attributable to Honeywell 4,966 5,542 (576) 4,779 763 Noncash adjustments 1,946 971 975 1,284 (313) Changes in working capital (1,334) 51 (1,385) 617 (566) Other operating activities (304) (526) 222 (472) (54) Net cash provided by operating activities 5,274 6,038 (764) 6,208 (170) Net cash used for investing activities (93) (1,061) 968 (987) (74) Net cash used for financing activities (6,330) (8,254) 1,924 (81) (8,173) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (183) (39) (144) 68 (107) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1,332) (3,316) 1,984 5,208 (8,524) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 9,627 &#160; $ 10,959 &#160; $ (1,332) $ 14,275 &#160; $ (3,316) ##TABLE_END\n\n38 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 compared with 2021 \n\nCash related to operating activities decreased by $764 million primarily due to an unfavorable impact to working capital. Working capital declined by $1,385 million, led by decreases in Accounts payable of $899 million, primarily due to a decrease in purchases of materials driven by lower sales volumes and a decrease in days payables outstanding, and increases in Accounts receivable of $731 million, primarily due to revenue growth mainly as a result of pricing actions. Operating cash flow was further reduced by the decrease in Net income attributable to Honeywell, partially offset by higher noncash adjustments for repositioning and other net charges for the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale and charges related to the initial Suspension and Wind down of our business and operations in Russia, and a decrease in pension and other postretirement income. \n\nCash related to investing activities increased by $968 million primarily due to a $1,148 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. \n\nCash related to financing activities increased by $1,924 million primarily due to a $3,067 million decrease in the payments of long-term debt and $436 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by a $820 million increase in repurchases of common stock and $790 million decrease in the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. \n\nCASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY \n\nIn addition to our normal operating cash requirements, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2023 to be as follows: \n\n&#8226; Capital expenditures&#8212;we expect to spend approximately $1.0 billion for capital expenditures in 2023 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, implementation of cost reduction measures, maintenance, and replacement. \n\n&#8226; Share repurchases&#8212;under our share repurchase program, $2.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2022, for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. \n\n&#8226; Dividends&#8212;we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $1.03 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2022 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. \n\nWe continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. In addition, multiple third-party financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain financing (SCF) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. We agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure from our suppliers, including prices, quantities, and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Our suppliers&#8217; voluntary participation in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms and we have no economic interest in a supplier&#8217;s decision to participate in the SCF program. \n\nAmounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2022, Accounts payable included approximately $700 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. Amounts settled with third-party financial institutions through the SCF program increased approximately $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, ref lects a combination of an ext ension of payment terms with suppliers and increased utilization of our SCF program. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While access to SCF could decrease if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not believe that changes in the availability of SCF will have a significant impact on our liquidity. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. \n\nWe sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. Transfers of the receivables are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold are excluded from Accounts receivable&#8212;net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the cash received is recorded in Cost of products and services sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. \n\nFinally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit, and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability, or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. \n\n39 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nIn early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.5 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. During 2023, and pursuant to the NARCO Amended Buyout Agreement, we expect to receive approximately $295 million related to the HWI Sale. We believe these payments and receipts will not materially impact our liquidity position. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. \n\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. \n\nSee Note 9 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS \n\nFollowing is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Total (6)(7) \n\nPayments by Period Thereafter 2023 2024 - 2025 \n\n2026 - 2027 \n\nLong-term debt, including finance leases (1) \n\n$ 16,853 $ 1,730 $ 3,059 $ 2,523 $ 9,541 Interest payments on long-term debt, including finance leases 4,523 472 844 738 2,469 Operating lease liabilities 1,080 208 315 203 354 \n\nPurchase obligations (2) \n\n2,844 1,453 962 283 146 \n\nEstimated environmental liability payments (3) \n\n615 222 201 171 21 \n\nAsbestos-related liability payments (4) \n\n1,291 111 204 178 798 \n\nAsbestos insurance recoveries (5) \n\n(130) (18) (29) (21) (62) &#160; $ 27,076 &#160; $ 4,178 &#160; $ 5,556 &#160; $ 4,075 &#160; $ 13,267 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. \n\n(2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. \n\n(3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2022. \n\n(4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos-related cash payments for Bendix based on our asbestos-related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2022. Amounts exclude payments made in January 2023 in connection with the NARCO Buyout. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos-related liabilities as of December 31, 2022. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\n(7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Resideo. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nASBESTOS MATTERS \n\nPayments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $166 million, $240 million, and $229 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $133 million in 2023. We expect to make payments associated with these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. In early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.3 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout. For additional information regarding the NARCO Buyout, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n40 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS \n\nAccruals during the year for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $186 million, $168 million, and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $71 million, $88 million, and $88 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. \n\nPayments related to known environmental matters were $211 million, $210 million, and $216 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $222 million in 2023. We expect to make payments associated with these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreement with other parties. \n\nReimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2022 and are expected to be $140 million in 2023. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. \n\n41 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ##TABLE_END\n\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. \n\nThe following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2022, and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Face or Notional Amount Carrying \n\nValue (1) \n\nFair \n\nValue (1) \n\nEstimated \n\nIncrease \n\n(Decrease) \n\nin Fair \n\nValue (2) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest rate sensitive instruments &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 16,853 $ (16,853) $ (15,856) $ (980) Interest rate swap agreements 4,984 (287) (287) (189) Total $ 21,837 $ (17,140) $ (16,143) $ (1,169) Foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n$ 10,545 $ 85 $ 85 $ (305) Cross currency swap agreements 3,189 90 90 (311) Total $ 13,734 $ 175 $ 175 $ (616) December 31, 2021 Interest rate sensitive instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 16,057 $ (16,057) $ (17,022) $ (1,148) Interest rate swap agreements 3,150 60 60 (112) Total $ 19,207 $ (15,997) $ (16,962) $ (1,260) Foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) \n\n$ 12,671 $ 92 $ 92 $ (628) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 39 39 (116) Total $ 13,871 $ 131 $ 131 $ (744) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Asset or (liability). \n\n(2) A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. \n\n(3) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. \n\nSee Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Transactions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\n42 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nSales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts &#8212;We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation&#8217;s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing, and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. \n\nIncome Taxes &#8212;On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes, and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. \n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. We assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. \n\nFor further discussion of additional income tax policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n43 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing &#8212;Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. \n\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets &#8212;The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: \n\n&#8226; Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; \n\n&#8226; Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; \n\n&#8226; Significant negative industry or economic trends; or \n\n&#8226; Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. \n\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans &#8212;We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense), and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). \n\nThe key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate: &#160; &#160; &#160; Projected benefit obligation 2.87 % 2.50 % 3.22 % Service cost 2.98 % 2.68 % 3.33 % Interest cost 2.26 % 1.76 % 2.76 % Assets: &#160; &#160; &#160; Expected rate of return 6.40 % 6.15 % 6.15 % Actual rate of return (10.45) % 6.84 % 13.81 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 8.77 % 11.37 % 10.64 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans&#8217; projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM Adjustments were expenses of $523 million, $40 million, and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n44 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ##TABLE_END\n\nWe determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of f uture market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2023, which is an increase in the assumption used for 2022. \n\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 5.17% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. \n\nIn addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future Pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: \n\n##TABLE_START Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Pension \n\nOngoing Expense \n\nImpact on Projected Benefit Obligation 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $16 million Increase $310 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $15 million Decrease $296 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $41 million &#8212; 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $41 million &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nPension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $545 million in 2023 compared with Pension ongoing income of $993 million in 2022. The expected decrease in pension income is due to changes in market conditions over the course of 2022. Significantly higher discount rates globally have increased the interest cost on the plan obligations, while decreasing asset values in plans, reducing the expected return generated by the plan assets. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2023, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. \n\nAsbestos-Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries &#8212;The recognition of asbestos-related liabilities relates to a predecessor company, Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix). For Bendix asbestos-related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrue for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year. \n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which was considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos-related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#8217;s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. \n\nContingent Liabilities &#8212;We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal, and environmental, health, and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation, and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions, or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management&#8217;s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. \n\n45 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nLITIGATION \n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos, and other litigation matters. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nSee Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \n\n46 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \n\nThe executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Information concerning mine safety and other regulatory matters associated with this mine is required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K and is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K. \n\n48 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol &#8220;HON.&#8221; We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $1.03 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2022 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. \n\nThe number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2022, was 37,527. \n\nInformation regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in the section titled Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption &#8220;Equity Compensation Plans.&#8221; \n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. \n\nRepurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which could include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase transactions, negotiated block transactions, 10b5-1 plans, other transactions that may be structured through investment banking institutions or privately negotiated, or a combination of the foregoing. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time (i) to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting, and matching contributions under our savings plans, and (ii) to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. \n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Honeywell purchased 6,783,496 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share. As of December 31, 2022, $2.9 billion remained available for additional share repurchases.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES \n\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell&#8217;s significant accounting policies. \n\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION \n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. The Company's consolidation policy requires equity investments that the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee&#8217;s activities, to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which the Company does not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. \n\nRECLASSIFICATIONS \n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, Balance Sheet and Cash Flows (Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities&#8212;Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the key terms of the program, a description of where in the financial statements amounts outstanding under the program are presented, a rollforward of such amounts, and interim disclosure of amounts outstanding as of the end of each period. The guidance does not affect recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance programs. The ASU is effective on January 1, 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective on January 1, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements . \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) : Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition away from reference rates expected to be discontinued to alternative reference rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , to expand the scope of this guidance to include derivatives. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into on or before December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 , which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024. The Company will apply the guidance to impacted transactions during the transition period. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n57 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nResearch and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Amounts expensed as incurred for Company-sponsored research and development projects are included in Cost of products and services sold and were $ 1,478 million, $ 1,333 million, and $ 1,334 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies. This revenue was $ 1,336 million, $ 1,284 million, and $ 1,200 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS \n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. \n\nINVENTORIES \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimate selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. \n\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT \n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements an d 3 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset&#8217;s useful life. \n\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter, and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events. \n\nPrior to 2022, the Company performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment test as of the last day of the first quarter. In 2022, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment to the first day of the fourth quarter. The Company believes this change does not represent a material change in method of applying an accounting principle. This change has been applied prospectively as of the date of the change, as retrospective application is deemed impracticable due to the inability to objectively determine the assumptions used in earlier periods without the benefit of hindsight. This voluntary change is preferable under the circumstances as it results in better alignment with the timing of the Company&#8217;s forecasting process and reduces the time period between the assessment date and annual financial statements. This change in accounting principle does not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment of goodwill. In 2022, due to this change the Company performed annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests as of the last day of the first quarter and the first day of the fourth quarter. \n\nFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nOther intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks, and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 20 years. \n\n58 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nCAPITALIZED SOFTWARE \n\nThe Company capitalizes costs of software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortizes those costs using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the software, not to exceed 7 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. Development costs for software held for sale are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on estimated useful life, not to exceed 7 years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. Capitalized software held for internal use and held for sale is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION \n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs, and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. \n\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nAll derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. \n\nDerivative financial instruments designated as hedges must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. The Company elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. \n\nLEASES \n\nAt the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n\nAll significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term. \n\nROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. \n\n59 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. \n\nThe Company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. In determining the borrowing rate, the Company considers the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when available. \n\nPENSION BENEFITS \n\nThe Company presents net periodic pension costs by disaggregating the service cost component of such costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of such costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. \n\nThe Company records the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Cost of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Other (income) expense. The Company recognizes net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment is also reported in Other (income) expense. \n\nSALES RECOGNITION \n\nProduct and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance, and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost input method of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The Company reviews its cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. \n\nThe customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of the Company's products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) within Other assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred contract fulfillment costs were approximately $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, and 2021. The amounts recognized as Cost of products and services sold were approximately $ 0.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 0.1 billion for 2021 and 2020. \n\nRevenues for the Company's mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. \n\n60 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount the Company will receive from customers. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company. \n\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS \n\nThe principal awards issued under the Company's stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on the Company's historical forfeiture rates. \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. For additional information, see Note 5 Income Taxes. \n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE \n\nBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL \n\nThe Company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that it has incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. \n\nASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES \n\nThe Company recognizes a liability for any asbestos-related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. \n\nREIMBURSEMENT RECEIVABLES \n\nIn conjunction with the Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) spin-off, the Company entered into a reimbursement agreement under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily related to net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the reimbursement agreement. Accordingly, the Company recorded receivables based on estimates of the underlying reimbursable Honeywell environmental spend, and the Company monitors the recoverability of such receivables, which are subject to the terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. \n\n61 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nNOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES \n\nACQUISITIONS \n\nOn January 18, 2022, the Company acquired 100 % of the issued and outstanding shares of US Digital Designs, Inc., a leading provider of technologies for first responders, for total consideration of $ 186 million.

The disaggregation of the Company's revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Products, transferred point in time 59 &#160; % 58 &#160; % 61 &#160; % Products, transferred over time 14 &#160; 17 &#160; 15 &#160; Net product sales 73 &#160; 75 &#160; 76 &#160; Services, transferred point in time 8 &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; Services, transferred over time 19 &#160; 17 &#160; 16 &#160; Net service sales 27 &#160; 25 &#160; 24 &#160; Net sales 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END \n\nCONTRACT BALANCES \n\nThe Company records progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable&#8212;net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. \n\nContract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. \n\n64 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Contract assets&#8212;January 1 $ 2,060 &#160; $ 1,618 &#160; Contract assets&#8212;December 31 2,294 &#160; 2,060 &#160; Change in contract assets&#8212;increase (decrease) $ 234 &#160; $ 442 &#160; Contract liabilities&#8212;January 1 $ ( 4,290 ) $ ( 4,033 ) Contract liabilities&#8212;December 31 ( 4,583 ) ( 4,290 ) Change in contract liabilities&#8212;(increase) decrease $ ( 293 ) $ ( 257 ) Net change $ ( 59 ) $ 185 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe net change in 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $ 1,838 million and $ 1,925 million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. \n\nContract assets include $ 2,265 million and $ 2,035 million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of customer contracts to which they relate. \n\nWhen contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Company's measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. \n\nPERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS \n\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contract&#8217;s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Company's contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when the Company's contracts includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract&#8217;s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable stand-alone sales are used to determine the stand-alone selling price. \n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. \n\nThe following table outlines the Company's remaining performance obligations disaggregated by reportable business segment: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 Aerospace $ 11,607 &#160; Honeywell Building Technologies 6,991 &#160; Performance Materials and Technologies 8,111 &#160; Safety and Productivity Solutions 2,844 &#160; \n\nCorporate and All Other (1) \n\n5 &#160; \n\nTotal performance obligations (2) \n\n$ 29,558 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The remaining performance obligations within Corporate and All Other relate to the Quantinuum business. \n\n(2) Effective March 31, 2022, performance obligations excludes contracts with customers related to Russia as collectability is not reasonably assured. \n\n65 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nPerformance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2022, will be satisfied over the course of future periods. The Company's disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 62 % and 38 %, respectively. \n\nThe timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of the Company's fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment. \n\nThe Company applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. \n\nNOTE 4.

The workforce reductions related to our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $ 176 million related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment, primarily related to closing and relocating the production of certain respiratory manufacturing from a U.S.-based facility to a non-U.S. facility in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. The repositioning charges included exit costs of $ 122 million related to current period costs incurred for closure obligations associated with site transitions in the Company's Performance Materials and Technologies and Aerospace reportable business segments. Also, $ 56 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to higher than expected voluntary exits and adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. \n\nIn 2021, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 331 million, including severance costs of $ 80 million related to workforce reductions of 6,432 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace reportable business segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the realignment of a product line in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment, site transitions, mainly in the Aerospace reportable business segment, to more cost-effective locations, and the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $ 117 million primarily related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment. The repositioning charges included exit costs of $ 134 million primarily for current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, closure obligations associated with site transitions, and lease obligations for equipment. Also, $ 13 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. \n\nIn 2020, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 565 million, including severance costs of $ 475 million related to workforce reductions of 14,159 manufacturing and administrative positions across the Company's reportable business segments, with a majority of the workforce reductions in the Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segments. The workforce reductions primarily related to the Company aligning its cost structure with the slowdown in demand for many of its products and services due to the global recession, the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, and site consolidations and hub strategies. The repositioning charges included exit costs of $ 69 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects. Also, $ 47 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income mainly as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance actions resulting in lower payments. \n\n67 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe following table summarizes the status of the Company's total repositioning reserves: \n\n##TABLE_START Severance Costs Asset Impairments Exit Costs Total Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 555 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 96 &#160; $ 651 &#160; Charges 475 &#160; 21 &#160; 69 &#160; 565 &#160; Usage&#8212;cash ( 474 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 90 ) ( 564 ) Usage&#8212;noncash &#8212; &#160; ( 21 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 21 ) Divestitures &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Adjustments ( 44 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) ( 47 ) Foreign currency translation 15 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; 17 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2020 527 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 74 &#160; 601 &#160; Charges 80 &#160; 117 &#160; 134 &#160; 331 &#160; Usage&#8212;cash ( 299 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 83 ) ( 382 ) Usage&#8212;noncash &#8212; &#160; ( 119 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 119 ) Divestitures &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Adjustments ( 14 ) 2 &#160; ( 1 ) ( 13 ) Foreign currency translation ( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) ( 7 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 289 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 122 &#160; 411 &#160; Charges 122 &#160; 176 &#160; 122 &#160; 420 &#160; Usage&#8212;cash ( 135 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 140 ) ( 275 ) Usage&#8212;noncash &#8212; &#160; ( 168 ) ( 15 ) ( 183 ) Divestitures &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Adjustments ( 42 ) ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 56 ) Foreign currency translation 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 9 ) ( 8 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 235 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 74 &#160; $ 309 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCertain repositioning projects will recognize exit costs in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. Such exit costs incurred in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not significant. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company recognized $ 342 million of Asbestos-related charges, net of insurance and reimbursements related to the North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Buyout and HarbisonWalker International Holdings, Inc. (HWI) Sale. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion NARCO asbestos-related liabilities. \n\nThe Company recognized $ 295 million of Other charges related to the initial suspension (the Suspension) and the Wind down of our business and operations in Russia. These costs impacted all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact within the Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. The Other charges include costs recorded in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Cost of products and services sold includes $ 65 million primarily related to inventory reserves and the write-down of other assets, Selling, general and administrative includes $ 185 million primarily related to reserves against outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets, impairment of intangible assets, the write-down of other assets, and employee severance, and Other (income) expense includes $ 45 million related to foreign exchange revaluation on an intercompany loan with a Russian affiliate, impairment of property, plant and equipment, and expenses for called guarantees. Directly attributable to our Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia, but excluded from Other charges, is a $ 2 million tax valuation allowance recorded to Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in the Company's remaining obligations related to contracts with Russian counterparties, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Based on available information to date, the Company&#8217;s estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to Suspension and Wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to the Company's Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of estimate for contingencies. \n\n68 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nAdditionally, for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Other charges include $ 41 million and $ 105 million, respectively, of incremental long-term contract labor cost inefficiencies due to severe supply chain disruptions (attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic) relating to the warehouse automation business within the Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. Certain of these costs incurred include amounts and provisions for anticipated losses recognized during 2022 and 2021 when total estimated costs at completion for certain of the business&#8217; long-term contracts exceeded total estimated revenue. These costs represent unproductive labor costs due to unexpected supply delays and the resulting downstream installation issues, demobilization and remobilization of contract workers, and resolution of contractor disputes. These costs do not include normal operational inefficiencies experienced during a challenging operating environment in 2022 and 2021. \n\nNOTE 5.

The decrease was primarily a result of additional tax expense reported in 2021 arising from a valuation allowance established against a capital loss, partially offset by a tax benefit related to restructuring transactions. In 2022, the valuation allowance was partially released as losses were utilized against a capital gain. Additionally, in 2022, there was lower tax expense reported for contingencies as a result of the release of certain state income tax reserves The Company&#8217;s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 27.5 %, an increase of approximately 1.5 percentage points compared to 2021. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a 2021 tax benefit recorded for the release of a valuation allowance on net operating losses due to restructuring in Canada, which resulted in more tax expense in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was partially offset by lower tax expense recorded in 2022 related to tax reserves when compared to 2021. \n\nThe effective tax rate increased by 3.4 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, incremental tax reserves, a lower tax benefit from restructuring, and the absence of prior year items including tax benefits realized as a result of the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, tax law changes in India, and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters offset by a non-cash charge related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit. The Company&#8217;s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 26.0 %, an increase of approximately 14.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to incremental tax reserves, the tax impact of restructuring and the absence of prior year items including the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, and tax law changes in India. \n\n70 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES) \n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Deferred tax assets: December 31, 2022 2021 Postretirement benefits other than pensions $ 59 &#160; $ 77 &#160; Asbestos and environmental 545 &#160; 468 &#160; Employee compensation and benefits 142 &#160; 174 &#160; Lease liabilities 233 &#160; 242 &#160; Other accruals and reserves 363 &#160; 260 &#160; Net operating losses 695 &#160; 734 &#160; Capital loss limitation and carryover 126 &#160; 151 &#160; Tax credit carryforwards 163 &#160; 164 &#160; Gross deferred tax assets 2,326 &#160; 2,270 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 812 ) ( 857 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 1,514 &#160; $ 1,413 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Pension $ ( 1,088 ) $ ( 948 ) Property, plant and equipment ( 233 ) ( 464 ) Right-of-use asset ( 212 ) ( 230 ) Intangibles ( 818 ) ( 883 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 517 ) ( 426 ) Other asset basis differences ( 317 ) ( 334 ) Other ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 3,186 ) ( 3,287 ) Net deferred tax liability $ ( 1,672 ) $ ( 1,874 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company's gross deferred tax assets include $ 869 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, primarily in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom, and deductible temporary differences. The Company maintains a valuation allowance of $ 683 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $ 129 million is maintained against the U.S. gross deferred tax asset primarily related to capital loss carryovers. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease of $ 8 million, an increase of $ 124 million, and an increase of $ 105 million to income tax expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In the event the Company determines that it will not be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if the Company determines that it will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, the Company will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $ 517 million deferred tax liability on all unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $ 17 billion as of the balance sheet date. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2042 $ 584 &#160; $ 94 &#160; U.S. State 2042 449 &#160; 21 &#160; Non-U.S. 2042 450 &#160; 53 &#160; Non-U.S. Indefinite 2,062 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; $ 3,545 &#160; $ 168 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n71 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nMany jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

LEASES \n\nA significant portion of the Company's operating and finance lease portfolio includes corporate offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing sites, information technology equipment, and automobiles. The majority of the Company's leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for 5 years or more. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in Accrued liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance lease ROU assets are included in Property, plant and equipment&#8212;net. The current portion of finance lease liabilities are included in Current maturities of long-term debt, and the non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are included in Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nA portion of the Company's real estate leases is generally subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. In addition, a subset of the Company's automobile leases are considered variable. The variable lease payments for such automobiles leases are based on actual mileage incurred at the stated contractual rate and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 224 &#160; $ 228 &#160; Variable lease cost 8 &#160; 14 &#160; Short-term lease cost 18 &#160; 15 &#160; Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 72 &#160; 65 &#160; Interest on lease liability 21 &#160; 24 &#160; Total finance lease cost 93 &#160; 89 &#160; Total lease cost $ 343 &#160; $ 346 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows for operating leases $ 225 &#160; $ 215 &#160; Operating cash flows for finance leases 21 &#160; 24 &#160; Financing cash flows for finance leases 79 &#160; 67 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases $ 251 &#160; $ 350 &#160; Finance leases 61 &#160; 32 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n77 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Operating leases: Other assets $ 881 &#160; $ 947 &#160; Accrued liabilities 192 &#160; 185 &#160; Other liabilities 775 &#160; 847 &#160; Total operating lease liabilities $ 967 &#160; $ 1,032 &#160; Finance leases: Property, plant and equipment $ 383 &#160; $ 325 &#160; Accumulated depreciation ( 161 ) ( 177 ) Property, plant and equipment&#8212;net $ 222 &#160; $ 148 &#160; Current maturities of long-term debt $ 77 &#160; $ 57 &#160; Long-term debt 145 &#160; 99 &#160; Total finance lease liabilities $ 222 &#160; $ 156 &#160; Weighted average remaining lease term: Operating leases 8 years 9 years Finance leases 4 years 3 years Weighted average discount rate: Operating leases 2.1 &#160; % 2.3 &#160; % Finance leases 7.8 &#160; % 11.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Operating Leases Finance Leases 2023 $ 208 &#160; $ 94 &#160; 2024 176 &#160; 81 &#160; 2025 139 &#160; 37 &#160; 2026 115 &#160; 15 &#160; 2027 88 &#160; 12 &#160; Thereafter 354 &#160; 18 &#160; Total lease payments 1,080 &#160; 257 &#160; Less&#8212;interest ( 113 ) ( 35 ) Total $ 967 &#160; $ 222 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n78 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nNOTE 11. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS \n\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES \n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. To qualify as a hedge, derivative financial instruments must be evaluated for hedge effectiveness at the inception of the contract and designated as a hedge. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT \n\nThe Company operates a global business in a wide variety of foreign currencies. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions arising from international trade. The Company's objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. The Company monitors its collective foreign currency exposure and enters into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\nThe Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. Dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (income) expense. The Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. The Company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company held contracts with notional amounts of $ 10,545 million and $ 12,671 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, and Indian Rupee. \n\nThe Company also designates certain foreign currency debt and derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations. Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. \n\nINTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT \n\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term, and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to convert the interest rate mix of the Company's total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. \n\nCREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT \n\nThe Company continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its counterparties to mitigate the risk of nonperformance. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. In addition, the Company grants credit terms to its customers in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company's credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. The Company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. \n\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT \n\nThe Company's operations subject us to risk related to the price volatility of certain commodities. To mitigate the commodity price risk associated with the Company's operations, the Company may enter into commodity derivative instruments. In March 2022, the Company entered into various contracts to mitigate commodity price volatility. The Company elected to apply hedge accounting to these contracts. \n\n79 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nDERIVATIVE AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS \n\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of the Company&#8217;s outstanding derivatives by risk category and instrument type within the Consolidated Balance Sheet: \n\n##TABLE_START Notional Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Derivatives in fair value hedging relationships: &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest rate swap agreements $ 4,984 &#160; $ 3,150 &#160; $ 16 &#160; $ 60 &#160; $ ( 303 ) $ &#8212; &#160; Derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships: Foreign currency exchange contracts 866 &#160; 647 &#160; 19 &#160; 4 &#160; ( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; Commodity contracts 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; Derivatives in net investment hedging relationships: Foreign currency exchange contracts &#8212; &#160; 746 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 92 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Cross currency swap agreements 3,189 &#160; 1,200 &#160; 90 &#160; 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments 9,048 &#160; 5,743 &#160; 125 &#160; 195 &#160; ( 309 ) &#8212; &#160; Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign currency exchange contracts 9,679 &#160; 11,278 &#160; 74 &#160; 278 &#160; ( 3 ) ( 282 ) Total derivatives at fair value $ 18,727 &#160; $ 17,021 &#160; $ 199 &#160; $ 473 &#160; $ ( 312 ) $ ( 282 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nAll derivative assets are presented in Other current assets or Other assets.

Gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $ 347 million of expense, $ 135 million of expense, and $ 169 million of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS \n\nThe 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. At December 31, 2022, there were 30,635,612 , and 797,252 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. \n\nSTOCK OPTIONS \n\nThe exercise price, term, and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the Company's stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee&#8217;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four -year period and expire after ten years . \n\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \n\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations from stock options: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Compensation expense $ 45 &#160; $ 55 &#160; $ 50 &#160; Future income tax benefit recognized 10 &#160; 11 &#160; 10 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n85 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related weighted average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 \n\nWeighted average fair value per share of options granted during the year (1) \n\n$ 31.22 &#160; $ 32.42 &#160; $ 21.30 &#160; Assumptions: Expected annual dividend yield 2.58 &#160; % 2.31 &#160; % 2.59 &#160; % Expected volatility 23.05 &#160; % 24.69 &#160; % 18.76 &#160; % Risk-free rate of return 1.97 &#160; % 0.48 &#160; % 1.32 &#160; % Expected option term (years) 4.74 4.54 4.62 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Estimated on date of grant using Black-Scholes option-pricing model. \n\nThe following table summarizes information about stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at December 31, 2019 18,731,562 &#160; $ 109.87 &#160; Granted 3,192,693 &#160; 176.93 &#160; Exercised ( 4,424,754 ) 88.96 &#160; Lapsed or canceled ( 930,972 ) 156.62 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2020 16,568,529 &#160; 125.75 &#160; Granted 2,065,574 &#160; 204.99 &#160; Exercised ( 2,016,489 ) 113.01 &#160; Lapsed or canceled ( 764,675 ) 175.42 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2021 15,852,939 &#160; 135.31 &#160; Granted 2,150,910 &#160; 189.53 &#160; Exercised ( 3,046,107 ) 103.89 &#160; Lapsed or canceled ( 905,454 ) 186.35 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2022 14,052,288 &#160; $ 147.14 &#160; \n\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2022 (1) \n\n13,056,367 &#160; $ 143.72 &#160; Exercisable at December 31, 2022 9,509,606 &#160; $ 127.99 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents the sum of vested options of 9.5 million and expected to vest options of 3.5 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS \n\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, the Company's policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that the handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, the Company, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and is a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. \n\nWith respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is the Company's policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory, or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology, and information related to individual sites, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of the Company's recorded liabilities. The Company expects to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreements with other parties. \n\nThe following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 618 &#160; $ 660 &#160; $ 709 &#160; Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 186 &#160; 168 &#160; 173 &#160; Environmental liability payments ( 211 ) ( 210 ) ( 216 ) Other 22 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 6 ) End of year $ 615 &#160; $ 618 &#160; $ 660 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEnvironmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 2021 Accrued liabilities $ 222 &#160; $ 225 &#160; Other liabilities 393 &#160; 393 &#160; $ 615 &#160; $ 618 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation, or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering the Company's past experience and existing reserves, the Company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. \n\nIn conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo&#8217;s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90 % of Honeywell&#8217;s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $ 140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than $ 25 million. \n\n92 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nReimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from Resideo quarterly and were $ 140 million in both 2022 and 2021 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90 % of such costs is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2022 and 2021 was $ 157 million and $ 146 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, Other current assets and Other assets included $ 140 million and $ 474 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. As of December 31, 2021, Other current assets and Other assets included $ 140 million and $ 457 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. \n\nASBESTOS MATTERS \n\nHoneywell is named in asbestos-related personal injury claims related to NARCO, which was sold in 1986, and the Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014. \n\nThe following tables summarize information concerning NARCO and Bendix asbestos-related balances: \n\nASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Beginning of year $ 1,372 &#160; $ 689 &#160; $ 2,061 &#160; $ 1,441 &#160; $ 779 &#160; $ 2,220 &#160; $ 1,499 &#160; $ 858 &#160; $ 2,357 &#160; Accrual for update to estimated liability 93 &#160; ( 634 ) ( 541 ) 64 &#160; 31 &#160; 95 &#160; 80 &#160; 18 &#160; 98 &#160; Change in estimated cost of future claims 41 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 41 &#160; 29 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 29 &#160; 42 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 42 &#160; Update of expected resolution values for pending claims 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; Asbestos-related liability payments ( 216 ) ( 55 ) ( 271 ) ( 165 ) ( 121 ) ( 286 ) ( 190 ) ( 97 ) ( 287 ) NARCO Buyout &#8212; &#160; 1,325 &#160; 1,325 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; End of year $ 1,291 &#160; $ 1,325 &#160; $ 2,616 &#160; $ 1,372 &#160; $ 689 &#160; $ 2,061 &#160; $ 1,441 &#160; $ 779 &#160; $ 2,220 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nINSURANCE RECOVERIES FOR ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Beginning of year $ 142 &#160; $ 221 &#160; $ 363 &#160; $ 148 &#160; $ 254 &#160; $ 402 &#160; $ 153 &#160; $ 281 &#160; $ 434 &#160; Probable insurance recoveries related to estimated liability 5 &#160; 2 &#160; 7 &#160; 7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 10 &#160; Insurance receipts for asbestos-related liabilities ( 17 ) ( 20 ) ( 37 ) ( 13 ) ( 33 ) ( 46 ) ( 33 ) ( 25 ) ( 58 ) Insurance receivables settlements and write-offs &#8212; &#160; ( 68 ) ( 68 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18 &#160; ( 2 ) 16 &#160; End of year $ 130 &#160; $ 135 &#160; $ 265 &#160; $ 142 &#160; $ 221 &#160; $ 363 &#160; $ 148 &#160; $ 254 &#160; $ 402 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNARCO and Bendix asbestos-related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 2021 Other current assets $ 41 &#160; $ 41 &#160; Insurance recoveries for asbestos-related liabilities 224 &#160; 322 &#160; $ 265 &#160; $ 363 &#160; Accrued liabilities $ 1,436 &#160; $ 261 &#160; Asbestos-related liabilities 1,180 &#160; 1,800 &#160; &#160; $ 2,616 &#160; $ 2,061 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n93 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nNARCO Products &#8211; NARCO manufactured high-grade, heat-resistant, refractory products for various industries. Honeywell&#8217;s predecessor, Allied Corporation, owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986. Allied Corporation sold the NARCO business in 1986 and entered into a cross-indemnity agreement which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims, arising primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980 and filed for bankruptcy in January 2002, at which point in time all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. The Company established its initial liability for NARCO asbestos claims in 2002. \n\nNARCO emerged from bankruptcy in April 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing NARCO asbestos claims (the Trust). Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the Trust (Channeling Injunction). The NARCO Trust Agreement (TA) and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (TDP) set forth the structure and operating rules of the Trust, and established Honeywell&#8217;s evergreen funding obligations. \n\nThe operating rules per the TDP define criteria claimants must meet for a claim to be considered valid and paid. Once operational in 2014, the Trust began to receive, process, and pay claims. In September 2021, Honeywell filed suit against the Trust in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (Bankruptcy Court) alleging that the Trust breached its duties in managing the Trust, including breaches of certain provisions of the TA and TDP. Honeywell's lawsuit sought appropriate relief preventing the Trust from continuing these practices. The Trust also filed suit against Honeywell, alleging Honeywell breached its obligations under the Trust's governing documents. Honeywell moved to dismiss the Trust&#8217;s suit, and on December 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court granted Honeywell&#8217;s motion to dismiss subject to granting the Trust leave to file an amended complaint. On December 28, 2021, the Trust filed an answer with counterclaims in response to Honeywell&#8217;s complaint and in lieu of filing an amended complaint. The Bankruptcy Court conducted a trial on these matters during May 2022; following the trial, the Company and the Trust began discussing a potential settlement of Honeywell&#8217;s remaining obligations to the Trust. \n\nOn November 18, 2022, Honeywell entered into a definitive agreement (Buyout Agreement) with the Trust, and on November 20, 2022, in exchange for the NARCO Trust Advisory Committee (TAC) and Lawrence Fitzpatrick, in his capacity as the NARCO Asbestos Future Claimants Representative (FCR), becoming parties to the Buyout Agreement, Honeywell, the Trust, the TAC, and the FCR entered into an Amended and Restated Buyout Agreement (Amended Buyout Agreement). \n\nPursuant to the terms of the Amended Buyout Agreement, Honeywell agreed to make a one-time, lump sum payment in the amount of $ 1.325 billion to the Trust (Buyout Amount), subject to certain deductions as described in the Amended Buyout Agreement and in exchange for the release by the Trust of Honeywell from all further and future obligations of any kind related to the Trust and/or any claimants who were exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold, or distributed by NARCO or its predecessors, including Honeywell&#8217;s ongoing evergreen obligation to fund (i) claims against the Trust, which comprise Honeywell&#8217;s NARCO asbestos-related claims liability, and (ii) the Trust&#8217;s annual operating expenses, which are expensed as incurred, including its legal fees (which operating expenses, for reference, were approximately $ 30 million in 2022) (such evergreen obligations referred to in (i) and (ii), Honeywell Obligations) (the NARCO Buyout). \n\nOn December 8, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order that (A) approved the Amended Buyout Agreement, and (B) declared that the NARCO Channeling Injunction (which bars all past, present, and future individual actions in state or federal courts based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products and requires all such claims to be made against the Trust) will remain in full force and effect without modification, dissolution, or termination (Order). \n\nOn December 14, 2022, HWI, the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the NARCO bankruptcy, entered into a definitive agreement (Sale Agreement) pursuant to which an affiliate of Platinum Equity, LLC will acquire HWI (HWI Sale) subject to the terms set forth in the Sale Agreement, including customary conditions to closing set forth therein. In accordance with the Amended Buyout Agreement, the economic rights of the Trust in respect of the net proceeds from the HWI Sale inure to the benefit of Honeywell. \n\nOn January 30, 2023, the Company paid the Buyout Amount to the Trust, the parties closed the transactions contemplated in the Amended Buyout Agreement (Closing), and Honeywell was released from the Honeywell Obligations. Honeywell continues to have the right to collect proceeds in connection with its NARCO asbestos-related insurance policies. \n\nWith the issuance of the Order, the Company derecognized the NARCO asbestos-related liability of $ 688 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized a charge of $ 1.325 billion in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and accrued a corresponding liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Buyout Amount. In addition, the Company recognized a benefit of $ 295 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and corresponding asset in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Honeywell's rights to the proceeds from the HWI Sale. The benefit of $ 295 million offset the charge for the Buyout Amount. \n\n94 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nBendix Products &#8211; Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.

Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. The Company valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. The Company updates the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. \n\nThe Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on the Company's ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the Company's insurers. \n\nOn October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky (Plaintiff), a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the Court) alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which included payment by Honeywell of $ 10 million to settle the claims in dispute. On January 18, 2022, the Court approved the motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement. On May 3, 2022, the Court entered a final judgment and order approving the Settlement Agreement and dismissed the action. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lacked merit and has denied wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. \n\n95 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nGARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS \n\nIn conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable. \n\nOn September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reviewed the aggregate carrying value of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $ 509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements. \n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett&#8217;s amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on April 30, 2021 (the Effective Date), Garrett emerged from bankruptcy. On the Effective Date, and in accordance with the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $ 375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending legal actions related to the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, and (iv) all pending litigation between the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved. \n\nThe original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provided for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $ 35 million in 2022 and $ 100 million per year from 2023 to 2030 (inclusive) at the anniversary of the Effective Date, unless (i) Garrett&#8217;s consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year was less than $ 425 million, or (ii) Garrett did not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due would accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also included rights which allowed (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions were met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions were met. \n\nOn September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $ 400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial redemption. The First Partial Redemption would be applied to the latest scheduled redemption dates, beginning with the shares to be redeemed in 2030. The Amendment also provided that the Company could not exercise its right to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption did not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. \n\nOn December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerated the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allowed Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $ 207 million (Second Partial Redemption). The Second Partial Redemption is subject to similar terms as the First Partial Redemption, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption was also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise had sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022. \n\nOn December 17, 2021, Garrett announced their intention to effect the First Partial Redemption on December 28, 2021, in the amount of $ 211 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $ 211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption. \n\nOn February 18, 2022, Garrett early redeemed $ 197 million of the Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. Immediately following the early redemption, the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was $ 207 million. \n\nOn June 28, 2022, Garrett early redeemed all remaining shares of the Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of $ 212 million, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. Following the redemption, the Series B Preferred Stock were no longer outstanding. \n\n96 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for additional information on the fair value leveling of the Series B Preferred Stock. \n\nPETROBRAS AND UNAOIL MATTERS \n\nOn December 19, 2022, the Company reached a comprehensive resolution to the investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and certain Brazilian authorities (Brazilian Authorities) relating to the Company's use of third parties who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to a project awarded in 2010 for Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras). The investigations focused on the Company&#8217;s compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws (UOP Matters). The comprehensive resolution also resolves DOJ and SEC investigations relating to a matter involving a foreign subsidiary&#8217;s prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011 (the Unaoil Matter). \n\nIn connection with the comprehensive resolution, (i) the Company agreed to pay a total equivalent of $ 202.7 million, which payment occurred in January 2023, to the DOJ, the SEC, and the Brazilian Authorities, collectively, in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, (ii) the Company&#8217;s subsidiary, UOP, LLC (UOP), entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the DOJ for charges related to the UOP Matters, (iii) UOP entered into leniency agreements with the Brazilian authorities related to the UOP Matter in Brazil, and (iv) the Company entered into an agreement with the SEC that resolves allegations relating to the UOP Matters and the Unaoil Matter. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company agreed to undertake certain compliance measures and compliance reporting obligations. These agreements entirely resolve the Petrobras and Unaoil investigations. \n\nThe Company previously recorded a total of $ 210 million of charges related to these matters in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding reserve on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Following the resolution, in December 2022, the Company reduced its previously recorded reserve to $ 205 million, based on expected payment amounts at that time. \n\n97 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nOTHER MATTERS \n\nThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health, and safety matters. The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. \n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss (or a range of possible loss) in excess of current accruals for commitment and contingency matters, including those discussed in this Note 19. Considering the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause the Company to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. \n\nWARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company issues product warranties and product performance guarantees. The Company accrues for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 223 &#160; $ 243 &#160; $ 269 &#160; Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year 117 &#160; 146 &#160; 164 &#160; Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees ( 12 ) ( 7 ) ( 18 ) Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims ( 115 ) ( 159 ) ( 172 ) End of year $ 213 &#160; $ 223 &#160; $ 243 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nProduct warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 2021 Accrued liabilities $ 175 &#160; $ 180 &#160; Other liabilities 38 &#160; 43 &#160; $ 213 &#160; $ 223 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 20. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS \n\nThe Company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of the Company's U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified, and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell&#8217;s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company also sponsors defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. \n\nThe Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell&#8217;s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell&#8217;s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits the Company's exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from the Company's cash flows from operations. \n\n98 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nThe following tables summarize the balance sheet impact, including the benefit obligations, assets, and funded status associated with the Company's significant pension and other postretirement benefit plans: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 17,391 &#160; $ 18,054 &#160; $ 6,999 &#160; $ 7,670 &#160; Service cost 86 &#160; 105 &#160; 19 &#160; 26 &#160; Interest cost 380 &#160; 306 &#160; 103 &#160; 77 &#160; Plan amendments &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) Actuarial (gains) losses (1) \n\n( 3,135 ) 141 &#160; ( 1,929 ) ( 403 ) Benefits paid ( 1,421 ) ( 1,221 ) ( 261 ) ( 249 ) Settlements and curtailments ( 13 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency translation &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 533 ) ( 121 ) Other 2 &#160; 6 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Benefit obligation at end of year 13,290 &#160; 17,391 &#160; 4,400 &#160; 6,999 &#160; Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 20,560 &#160; 20,396 &#160; 8,396 &#160; 8,450 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 2,161 ) 1,344 &#160; ( 2,187 ) 166 &#160; Company contributions 37 &#160; 35 &#160; 17 &#160; 101 &#160; Benefits paid ( 1,421 ) ( 1,221 ) ( 261 ) ( 249 ) Settlements and curtailments ( 13 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency translation &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 664 ) ( 74 ) Other 3 &#160; 6 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; Fair value of plan assets at end of year 17,005 &#160; 20,560 &#160; 5,304 &#160; 8,396 &#160; Funded status of plans $ 3,715 &#160; $ 3,169 &#160; $ 904 &#160; $ 1,397 &#160; Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of: Prepaid pension benefit cost (2) \n\n$ 3,970 &#160; $ 3,528 &#160; $ 1,356 &#160; $ 2,105 &#160; Accrued pension liabilities&#8212;current (3) \n\n( 28 ) ( 33 ) ( 14 ) ( 14 ) Accrued pension liabilities&#8212;noncurrent (4) \n\n( 227 ) ( 326 ) ( 438 ) ( 694 ) Net amount recognized $ 3,715 &#160; $ 3,169 &#160; $ 904 &#160; $ 1,397 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The actuarial gains incurred in 2022 related to the Company's U.S. plans are primarily the result of an increase in the discount rate assumption, partially offset by actuarial losses primarily as a result of changes in demographic experience and demographic assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021.

The rate was changed to 2.36 % for the remainder of 2020 due to a Plan remeasurement as of October 1, 2020. \n\nThe discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company uses a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of the Company's benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments. The Company uses the single weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The Company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for the Company's significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For the Company's U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2023 are 5.26 % and 5.07 %, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is higher principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. \n\nThe Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.75 % for 2023, which represents an increase from the 6.40 % assumption used for 2022. The Company's asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. The Company reviews the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. \n\nFor non-U.S. benefit plans, actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. \n\n102 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ##TABLE_END\n\nHONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#8212;(Continued) \n\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) \n\nPENSION BENEFITS \n\nThe following amounts relate to the Company's significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 255 &#160; $ 359 &#160; $ 682 &#160; $ 964 &#160; Accumulated benefit obligation $ 253 &#160; $ 346 &#160; $ 664 &#160; $ 932 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 230 &#160; $ 256 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 13.3 billion and $ 17.3 billion and for the Company's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 4.4 billion and $ 6.9 billion at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Company's asset investment strategy for its U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve the Company's long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. The Company's long-term target allocations are as follows: 45 %- 65 % fixed income securities and cash, 25 %- 40 % equity securities, 5 %- 10 % real estate investments, and 10 %- 20 % other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located inside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity that follow several different strategies. The Company reviews its assets on a regular basis to ensure that the Company is within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. \n\nThe Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. The Company's non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. \n\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)&#8221;, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by the Company's pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company's U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 2,567 million and $ 4,415 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 120 million and $ 311 million, respectively. In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. \n\nCommon stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, and as such, include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds, and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price. \n\nThe Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2023. In 2022, contributions of $ 10 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2023, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $ 10 million to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards.

We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;generally accepted accounting principles&#8221;). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n111 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ##TABLE_END\n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRevenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers &#8211; Long-Term Contracts &#8211; Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term (&#8220;over time&#8221;) as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method. \n\nAccounting for long-term contracts requires management&#8217;s judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements. \n\nGiven the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to long-term contracts included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management&#8217;s assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management&#8217;s methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time. \n\n&#8226; We tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing. \n\n&#8226; We profiled the population of long-term contracts with longer duration and evaluated a selection of loss contracts or contracts with significant gross margin changes against historical performance to assess management&#8217;s ability to achieve estimates and to identify potential bias in the recognition of revenue over time. \n\n/S/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nCharlotte, North Carolina \n\nFebruary 10, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. \n\n112 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n"

RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. \n\n(2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSU&#8217;s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals and/or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. \n\n(3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2022, is 30,635,612, which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. \n\nThe number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2022, is 1,691,500. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. \n\n&#8226; The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 21,769 shares were credited to participants&#8217; accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan. \n\n&#8226; The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 724 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants&#8217; accounts under these plans. \n\nThe remaining 797,252 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. \n\n(4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refer to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. \n\nThe Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for certain highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and Company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell&#8217;s U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants&#8217; accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2022, is 205,709. \n\n(5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywell&#8217;s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. \n\n(6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. \n\n115 Honeywell International Inc. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n"
