In addition, our customers&#8217; requirements and preferences rapidly evolve, as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services. To keep pace with these changes, we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products, such as enabling more flexibility and sustainable outcomes. \n\nAutodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. We have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon software for the personal computer. Just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago, the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premise products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. Subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as project- \n\nTable of Contents \n\nbased users and small businesses. Subscription plans represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. \n\nWe dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to deliver additional automation and insights to our customers through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generative design, which increase efficiency and sustainability and reduce waste. These investments further enhance our existing products and create new solutions and technologies which connect the workflows and data of our customers across the ecosystem of their projects and expand our market opportunity. Our tools connect and automate the phases of design and creation, enabling greater collaboration and the seamless flow of data for individuals and teams across all phases. \n\nOur software is primarily developed internally; however, we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities. Additionally, we acquire or license products and technologies developed by third parties. We continually review these investments to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs. \n\nThe majority of our research and product development is performed in the United States, China, Canada, India, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. However, we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations. Translation and localization of our products are performed in several local markets, principally Singapore and Ireland. We generally localize and translate our products into German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified and traditional Chinese. \n\nWe plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to tap into a diverse global talent pool, optimize costs, and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. We continually assess costs, hiring challenges, and intellectual property protection, against the benefits of our international development activities. \n\nFor further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nMARKETING AND SALES \n\nWe sell our products and services globally, through a combination of indirect and direct channels. We also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers, and with customers through our online Autodesk branded store. Our indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where distributors sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure, where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. We have a network of approximately 1,500 resellers and distributors worldwide. For fiscal 2023, approximately 65% of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change, particularly as we scale our online Autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards direct-only business models. Additionally, as part of the continued growth of our online Autodesk branded store and the transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts and our new token-based Flex model, we are planning to expand our transactions with value-added resellers and transact directly with more end customers without substantial disruption to our revenue. We expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support a considerable portion of our customers. We also expect our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. We employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies. Our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nSales through our largest distributor, Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, &#8220;Tech Data&#8221;), accounted for 37%, 36%, and 37% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ingram Micro Inc. (&#8220;Ingram Micro&#8221;), our second-largest distributor, accounted for 9%, 9%, and 10% of Autodesk's total net revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We entered into transition agreements with two of our distributors Tech Data and Ingram Micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. In connection with the transition agreements, Autodesk intends to increase our selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. We believe our business is not substantially dependent on either Tech Data or Ingram Micro. No other distributor, reseller, or direct customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur customer-related operations are divided into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); and Asia Pacific (&#8220;APAC&#8221;). Each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations. These organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices. We believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue. Adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue, including emerging economies, may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. Our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nWe also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations, computer manufacturers, other software developers, and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising, promotions, and trade-show presentations. We employ mass-marketing techniques such as webcasts, seminars, telemarketing, direct mailings, sponsorships, advertising in business and trade journals, and social media. We have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products and services. \n\nWe generate revenue primarily through various offerings that provide recurring revenue. Under our subscription plan, customers can use our software anytime, anywhere, and get access to the latest updates to previous versions through term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and enterprise business agreements (&#8220;EBA&#8221;). Historically, we have had increased EBA sale activity in our fourth fiscal quarter. This seasonality may not have an immediate impact on our revenue as we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract. This seasonality may also affect the relative value of our billings, Remaining Performance Obligations (&#8220;RPO&#8221;), and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters. \n\nCUSTOMER AND RESELLER SUPPORT \n\nWe provide technical support and training to customers through a multi-tiered support model, augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific customer needs. Most of our customers receive support and training from the resellers and distributors from which they purchased subscriptions or licenses for our products or services, with Autodesk in turn providing second-tier support to the resellers and distributors. Other customers are supported directly via self-service using the Autodesk Knowledge Network, which guides customers to answers in our online support assets, support forums, or webinars, or to support representatives using different modalities such as social media, phone, email, and webchat. We also support our resellers and distributors through technical product training, sales training classes, webinars, and other knowledge-sharing programs. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE PROGRAMS \n\nImpact at Autodesk \n\nAutodesk is committed to advancing a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable world. We don&#8217;t believe in waiting for progress, we believe in making it. We take action as a business and to support our employees, customers, and communities in our collective opportunity to design and make a better world for all. \n\nWe focus our efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas: energy and materials, health and resilience, and work and prosperity. These impact opportunity areas are derived from the UN Sustainable Development Goals (&#8220;SDGs&#8221;) and have been focused through a multi-pronged process to align the top needs of our stakeholders, the important issues of our business, and the areas we are best placed to accelerate positive impact at scale. \n\nThese opportunities manifest as outcomes through how our customers leverage our technology to design and make net-zero carbon buildings, resilient infrastructure, more sustainable products, and a thriving workforce. We realize these opportunities in our business through neutralizing our greenhouse gas emissions, powering our operations with 100% renewable energy and promoting an inclusive culture. We advance these opportunities with industry innovators through collaboration, grants, software donations, and training. \n\nEducation \n\nAutodesk is committed to helping students gain the in-demand skills and certifications needed to demonstrate they are prepared for current and emerging roles in the industries we serve. We offer free educational licenses of Autodesk&#8217;s complete portfolio of professional software to verified students, educators, and accredited educational institutions worldwide. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAdditionally, we offer self-paced, modular learning and curriculum for K-12, post-secondary students, and educators. Our intention is to make Autodesk software the preferred choice for those poised to become the next generation of design, engineering, and construction professionals. \n\nSustainability \n\nClimate Change \n\nIn addressing the global challenges posed by climate change, we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation, building code, physical climate parameters, and other climate-related developments. This effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new Autodesk products and services in the short and long-term. Furthermore, our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes hand in hand with our values and reputation in the marketplace. Our FY23 Enterprise Risk Management process considered how climate impacts could affect and potentially amplify the overall significance of each identified risk and opportunity. \n\nClimate Change Management Actions \n\nTo drive continued progress and meet growing demand, we continue to expand the solutions, education, and support we offer, helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a low-carbon future by designing high-performance buildings, resilient cities and infrastructure, and more efficient transportation and products. To continue to grow this market, we provide software and support to early-stage entrepreneurs, nonprofit organizations, and start-up companies who are designing clean technologies. We are expanding these offerings based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change. \n\nInternally, we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and disaster management and recovery strategies. In fiscal year 2022, we deployed a new sustainability financing framework to accelerate new and existing efforts in these areas, including issuing a $1 billion sustainability bond to support eligible projects and initiatives. \n\nEmissions Performance &#38; Other Key Performance Indicators \n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we launched our second science-based GHG reduction target, to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHGs 50%, and reduce Scope 3 GHGs per dollar of gross profit 25%, by fiscal year 2031, compared to fiscal year 2020. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we were responsible for 103,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions across our operational, market-based, boundary. This represents a 55% reduction compared to our fiscal year 2020 base line. In addition, our residual 103,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions were neutralized through the procurement of high quality carbon offsets. \n\nImpact Reports \n\nMore information about our sustainability financing and commitment can be found in our annual Impact Reports, which we have published on our website since 2008. Our fiscal 2023 Impact Report will be published in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this report. \n\nPhilanthropy \n\nThe Autodesk Foundation (the &#8220;Foundation&#8221;), a privately funded 501(c)(3) charity organization established and solely funded by us, leads our philanthropic efforts. The purpose of the Foundation is twofold: to support employees to create a better world at work, at home, and in the community by matching employees&#8217; volunteer time and/or donations to nonprofit organizations; and to support organizations using design to drive positive social and environmental impact. In the latter case, we use philanthropic capital, software donations, and training to accomplish this goal, selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world, thus leading to a better future for our planet. On our behalf, the Foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations, social and environmental entrepreneurs, and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future. During fiscal 2020, Autodesk committed to target 1% of annual operating margin for the long-term support of the Autodesk Foundation. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDEVELOPER PROGRAMS \n\nOur business and our customers benefit from our relationships with an extensive developer network. These developers create and sell their own interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers. One of our key strategies is to maintain an Application Programming Interface (&#8220;API&#8221;) based architecture of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. This approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. We offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. For example, we created Autodesk Platform Services which includes web services that enable software developers to rapidly develop the next generation of applications and experiences that will power the future of making things. Autodesk Platform Services facilitates the development of a single connected ecosystem for integrating Autodesk applications with other enterprise, web, and mobile solutions. \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, are subject to rapid change, and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses. We strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development, allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers. We also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers. \n\nOur competitors include large, global, publicly traded companies; small, geographically focused firms; startup firms; and solutions produced in-house by their users. Our primary global competitors include Adobe Systems Incorporated, Bentley Systems, Inc., Dassault Syst&#232;mes S.A. and its subsidiary Dassault Syst&#232;mes SolidWorks Corp., Intergraph Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hexagon AB, MSC Software Corporation, Nemetschek AG, Oracle Corporation, Procore Technologies, Inc., PTC Inc., 3D Systems Corporation, Siemens PLM, and Trimble Navigation Limited, among others. \n\nThe software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The industry continues to undergo a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing. This shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies. The design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete, both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies. Competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve. In addition, some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources than we do. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins, and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for further discussion of risks regarding competition. \n\nWe believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products, including cloud and mobile computing products, whether by internal development or acquisition, and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use, reliability, performance, range of useful features, continuing product enhancements, reputation, price, and training. \n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSES \n\nWe maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. The nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises. We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. \n\nNonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Enforcement of intellectual \n\nTable of Contents \n\nproperty rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims. Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business. \n\nFrom time to time, we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights, including patents. Disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to, among other things, costly litigation or product shipment delays, which could harm our business. \n\nWe retain ownership of software we develop. Our combined hybrid offerings include both desktop software and cloud functionality. Desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to &#8216;click through&#8217; or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure, and transfer. Cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use. \n\nWe believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid, ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries, we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position. \n\nWhile we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software solutions, we are unable to measure the full extent to which unauthorized use of our software products exists. We believe, however, that unauthorized use of our software is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results. We believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the change from desktop to cloud-based computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is used without authorization. \n\nIn addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed technology. \n\nSee Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property. \n\nPRODUCTION AND SUPPLIERS \n\nThe production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media. The way that we deliver software has evolved during our business model transition. For certain cloud-based products, we use a combination of co-located hosting facilities and increasingly Amazon Web Services and to a lesser degree other infrastructure-as-a-service providers. We offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment and subsequent product updates. Customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor&#8217;s secure servers. Customers may also obtain our software through media such as DVDs and USB flash drives available from multiple sources. \n\nTALENT AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \n\nOur employees play a central role in the success of our long-term strategy. Autodesk&#8217;s Culture Code defines values and behaviors that support our commitment to being a customer company, where each employee takes responsibility for understanding our customers&#8217; needs, expectations, and experiences. As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 13,700 people, an increase from approximately 12,600 employees as of the end of fiscal year 2022. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain foreign countries, our employees are represented by trade unions or works councils. We have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are strong. Reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries, such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreign-owned businesses, which could negatively impact our business in the future. \n\nDiversity and Belonging \n\nAutodesk is committed to building and maintaining a diverse workforce and a culture of belonging that welcomes people from all backgrounds, perspectives, and beliefs. We have developed and embedded a holistic global Diversity and Belonging (&#8220;D&#38;B&#8221;) strategy into all that we do. Our D&#38;B strategy includes a variety of activities, such as inclusive leadership training for \n\nTable of Contents \n\nall people managers and senior employees, and hiring manager and interview classes that include training on mitigating bias and inclusive practices. \n\nTo help us build a more diverse workforce, we have continued to invest in our diversity partnerships. We partner with educational institutions such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and professional organizations around the globe supporting underrepresented groups in technology. We provide a variety of scholarships, internship programs, sponsorship agreements, mentoring and development partnerships, and program support to organizations focused on women and underrepresented groups. \n\nWe provide ongoing development opportunities, such as the Autodesk Mentorship Program, which provides one-on-one mentorship relationships. Autodesk has nine employee resource groups (&#8220;ERGs&#8221;), which are volunteer-led groups that bring employees together based on common interests, backgrounds or diversity characteristics, to foster a sense of belonging and connection. \n\nAdditional information on our D&#38;B program, initiatives, and metrics can be found on our website at https://www.autodesk.com/company/diversity-and-inclusion. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this report. \n\nProfessional Development and Employee Impact \n\nWe believe career development plays an important role in keeping our employees engaged and in providing additional opportunities for them to grow and build their careers. Autodesk offers extensive professional and technical development opportunities for our employees. These include self-service online modules and personalized learning paths, professional and management development programs, and a tuition reimbursement program. \n\nWe also encourage our employees to advance our vision for a better world and support their professional development by participating in our pro bono consulting program, using paid time to volunteer, and have their charitable giving matched by the Autodesk Foundation. \n\nTotal Rewards \n\nTo attract, retain, and support our employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs, several of which include an element of choice to meet the needs of our diverse and global population. In addition to competitive base pay and opportunities to receive short-term incentives, all our employees are eligible to participate in our long-term plans. We also have comprehensive health and wellness benefits, a generous time off program, an employee stock purchase plan, sabbaticals, retirement plans, financial support programs, financial tools and education, and an employee assistance program. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nACQUISITIONS \n\nWe acquired new technology or supplemented our existing technology by purchasing businesses or technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries.

We also make investments in privately held companies that develop technology that is complementary to or provide strategic value and expand opportunities for our technologies. \n\nREGULATION \n\nWe are subject to various regulations, particularly those involving privacy and import/export controls. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Laws and Regulations,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS \n\nBillings: Total revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period. \n\nCloud Service Offerings: Represents individual term-based offerings deployed through web browser technologies or in a hybrid software and cloud configuration. Cloud service offerings that are bundled with other product offerings are not captured as a separate cloud service offering. \n\nConstant Currency (CC) Growth Rates: We attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current and comparative periods. We calculate constant currency growth rates by (i) applying the applicable prior period exchange rates to current period results and (ii) excluding any gains or losses from foreign currency hedge contracts that are reported in the current and comparative periods. \n\nDesign Business: Represents the combination of maintenance, product subscriptions, and all EBAs. Main products include, but are not limited to, AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, Industry Collections, Revit, Inventor, Maya, and 3ds Max. Certain products, such as our computer aided manufacturing solutions, incorporate both Design and Make functionality and are classified as Design. \n\nEnterprise Business Agreements (EBAs): Represents programs providing enterprise customers with token-based access to a broad pool of Autodesk products over a defined contract term. \n\nFree Cash Flow: Cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures. \n\nIndustry Collections: Autodesk Industry Collections are a combination of products and services that target a specific user objective and support a set of workflows for that objective. Our Industry Collections consist of: Autodesk Architecture, Engineering and Construction Collection, Autodesk Product Design and Manufacturing Collection, and Autodesk Media and Entertainment Collection. \n\nMaintenance Plan: Our maintenance plans provide our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nUnder our maintenance plans, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the agreements, generally one year. \n\nMake Business: Represents certain cloud-based product subscriptions. Main products include, but are not limited to, Assemble, Autodesk Build, BuildingConnected, Fusion 360, and ShotGrid. Certain products, such as Fusion 360, incorporate both Design and Make functionality and are classified as Make. \n\nNet Revenue Retention Rate (NR3): Measures the year-over-year change in Recurring Revenue for the population of customers that existed one year ago (&#8220;base customers&#8221;). Net revenue retention rate is calculated by dividing the current quarter Recurring Revenue related to base customers by the total corresponding quarter Recurring Revenue from one year ago. Recurring Revenue is based on USD reported revenue, and fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedge gains or losses have not been eliminated. Recurring Revenue related to acquired companies, one year after acquisition, has been captured as existing customers until such data conforms to the calculation methodology. This may cause variability in the comparison. \n\nOther Revenue: Consists of revenue from consulting, training and other products and services, and is recognized as the products are delivered and services are performed. \n\nProduct Subscription: Provides customers a flexible, cost-effective way to access and manage 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software tools. Our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. \n\nRecurring Revenue: Consists of the revenue for the period from our traditional maintenance plans, our subscription plan offerings, and certain Other revenue. It excludes subscription revenue related to third-party products. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation. \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO): The sum of total short-term, long-term, and unbilled deferred revenue. Current remaining performance obligations is the amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the next twelve months. \n\nSpend : The sum of cost of revenue and operating expenses. \n\nSubscription Plan: Comprises our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and EBAs. Subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. With subscription, customers can use our software anytime, anywhere, and get access to the latest updates to previous versions. \n\nSubscription Revenue: Includes our cloud-enabled term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible EBAs. \n\nUnbilled Deferred Revenue: Unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, a number of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business, financial condition, and future results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted, causing the trading price of our common stock to decline. In addition, these risks and uncertainties may impact the forward-looking statements described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference. They could affect our actual results of operations, causing them to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. \n\nSummary of Risk Factors \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our securities. These risks are described more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the following: \n\n&#8226; Our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services, exposing us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects, and large expenditures. \n\n&#8226; Global economic and political conditions. \n\n&#8226; Costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments. \n\n&#8226; Dependency on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant international regulatory, economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political, and other risks. \n\n&#8226; Inability to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results. \n\n&#8226; Existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes. \n\n&#8226; Fluctuation of our financial results, key metrics and other operating metrics. \n\n&#8226; Deriving a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions, including our AutoCAD-based software products and collections. \n\n&#8226; Any failure to successfully execute and manage initiatives to realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives. \n\n&#8226; Net revenue, billings, earnings, cash flow, or subscriptions shortfalls or volatility of the market causing the market price of our stock to decline. \n\n&#8226; Social and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings. \n\n&#8226; Security incidents compromising the integrity of our or our customers&#8217; offerings, services, data, or intellectual property. \n\n&#8226; Reliance on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services as well as software. \n\n&#8226; Our highly complex software, which may contain undetected errors, defects, or vulnerabilities, and is subject to service disruptions, degradations, outages or other performance problems. \n\n&#8226; Increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws. \n\n&#8226; Governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls. \n\n&#8226; Protection of our intellectual property rights and intellectual property infringement claims from others. \n\n&#8226; The government procurement process. \n\n&#8226; Fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\n&#8226; Our debt service obligations. \n\n&#8226; Our investment portfolio consisting of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors. \n\n&#8226; The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures. \n\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy \n\nOur strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects, and large expenditures, each of which may result in no additional net revenue or decreased net revenue. \n\nThe software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences. In recent years, the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. Customers are also reconsidering how they purchase software products, which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. In response, we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. We devote significant resources to the development of new technologies. In addition, we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources, such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings and our transition of multi-subscription plans to named-user plans. It is uncertain whether these strategies, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nincluding our product and pricing changes, will accurately reflect customer demand or be successful, or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. We make such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions. Such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products, or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers&#8217; requirements, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted. \n\nIn particular, a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products, as well as other individual Autodesk products, expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloud-based functionality, and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration. At times, sales of our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT or individual Autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in Industry Collections or cloud-based functionality revenue, or without purchases of customer seats to our Industry Collections. Should this continue, our results of operations will be adversely affected. \n\nOur executive management team must continuously act quickly and with vision, given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry, the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products, and the rapid evolution of cloud computing, mobile devices, new computing platforms, and other technologies, such as consumer products. Although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges, if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt the strategy as market conditions evolve, we may fail to meet our customers&#8217; expectations, be unable to compete with our competitors' products and technology, and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees. This in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance. \n\nGlobal economic and political conditions may further impact our industries, business, and financial results. \n\nOur overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions. The United States and other countries&#8217; economies have experienced cyclical downturns, in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, decreased government spending, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity, and foreign exchange markets, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty. These economic conditions can occur abruptly. For example, current geopolitical and global macro-economic challenges and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic have caused uncertainty in the global economy, and an economic downturn or recession in the United States or in other countries may occur or has already occurred and may continue. The extent to which these challenges will impact our financial condition or results of operations is still uncertain and will continue to depend on developments such as the impact of these challenges on our customers, vendors, distributors, and resellers, such as the supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures and global labor shortage that we have seen recently, as well as other factors; the ebb and flow of COVID-19, including in specific geographies and as a result of outbreaks and variants; actions taken by governments, businesses, and consumers in response to these challenges; speed and timing of economic recovery, including in specific geographies; our billings and renewal rates, including new business close rates, rate of multi-year contracts, pace of closing larger transactions, and new unit volume growth; the war in Ukraine; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and the effect of these challenges on margins and cash flow. All of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time, and some of these factors are not within our control. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, which we have seen recently in certain countries including China. Our customers include government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services, our revenue could decline. In addition, a number of our customers rely, directly and indirectly, on government spending. \n\nAs described elsewhere in these risk factors, we are dependent on international revenue and operations and are subject to related risks of conducting business globally. Trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting business. These trends have increased political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets, and the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. Political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. A disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counter-parties and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. War, including the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy, could also affect our business. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments. \n\nWe regularly acquire or invest in businesses, software solutions, and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions, strategic alliances, or equity or debt investments, including several transactions in fiscal 2022 and the first fiscal quarter in fiscal 2023. The risks associated with such acquisitions include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims; failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections and expected synergies; the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and diversion of management's time and attention. In addition, such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as: \n\n&#8226; the inability to retain customers, key employees, vendors, distributors, business partners, and other entities associated with the acquired business; \n\n&#8226; the potential that due diligence of the acquired business or solution does not identify significant problems; \n\n&#8226; exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, or other third parties; \n\n&#8226; the potential for incompatible business cultures; \n\n&#8226; significantly higher than anticipated transaction or integration-related costs; \n\n&#8226; potential additional exposure to economic, tax, currency, political, legal, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and \n\n&#8226; the potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business. \n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results. \n\nWe are dependent on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant international regulatory, economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political, and other risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. \n\nInternational net revenue represented 66% and 67% of our net revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our international revenue, some of which comes from emerging economies, is subject to economic and political conditions in foreign markets, including those resulting from economic and political conditions in the United States, as well as country-specific conditions related to COVID-19, such as varied speed of recovery in different geographies. For example, we have recently seen a deceleration in growth in certain geographies including China. Our total revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time. Our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends, which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the United States are strong for a particular period. \n\nWe anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and, as we expand our international development, sales, and marketing expertise, will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the United States. Risks inherent in our international operations include: \n\n&#8226; economic volatility; \n\n&#8226; tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers and restrictions , including any political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors to the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia; \n\n&#8226; fluctuating currency exchange rates, including devaluations, currency controls, and inflation, and risks related to any hedging activities we undertake; \n\n&#8226; changes in regulatory requirements and practices; \n\n&#8226; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world; \n\n&#8226; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices, particularly in emerging economies; \n\n&#8226; compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws; \n\n&#8226; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations; \n\n&#8226; local competition; \n\n&#8226; longer collection cycles for accounts receivable; \n\n&#8226; U.S. and foreign tax law changes and the complexities of tax reporting; \n\n&#8226; laws regarding the free flow of data across international borders and management of and access to data and public networks; \n\n&#8226; possible future limitations upon foreign-owned businesses; \n\n&#8226; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; \n\n&#8226; inadequate local infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property; \n\n&#8226; software piracy; and \n\n&#8226; other factors beyond our control, including popular uprisings, terrorism, war (including the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy), natural disasters, and diseases and pandemics, such as COVID-19. \n\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. \n\nThe application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community, and the United Kingdom signed in December 2020 (the &#8220;TCA&#8221;), which took effect January 1, 2021, could have adverse tax, tax treaty, banking, operational, legal, regulatory, or other impacts on our businesses in the region. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, create currency volatility; disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union; and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the United Kingdom economy, the European Union economies, and the other economies in which we operate. \n\nIn addition, in recent years, the United States has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy, including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations, or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries in which we do business. More recently, the United States and other global actors have imposed sanctions as a result of the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia. New or increased tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy, including new sanctions, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, including Russia. In addition, certain foreign governments, including the Chinese government, have instituted or considered imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S.-manufactured goods. The escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the United States or any other countries in which we do business, such as announcing sanctions, a change in tariff structures, export compliance, or other trade policies, may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, the conduct of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business outlook. \n\nEven if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks. \n\nWe may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results. \n\nOur customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings, and they may elect not to renew, upgrade, or expand their subscriptions. We cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals. Customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including offering pricing; competitive offerings; customer satisfaction; and reductions in customer spending levels, customer activity, or number of users due to economic downturns, including as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, or financial markets uncertainty. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nExisting and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits. \n\nThe software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies . This shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies. The markets in which we operate are characterized by vigorous competition, both by entrants with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources. Furthermore, a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third-party applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms, may adversely affect the sale of our solutions. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins, and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business. \n\nOur financial results, key metrics, and other operating metrics fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter, making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict. \n\nOur quarterly financial results, key metrics, and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines. We also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forward-looking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations. In addition to the other risks described in these risk factors, some of the factors that could cause our financial results, key metrics, and other operating metrics to fluctuate include: \n\n&#8226; general market, economic, business, and political conditions in Europe, APAC, and emerging economies, including from an economic downturn or recession in the United States or other countries; \n\n&#8226; failure to produce sufficient revenue, billings, subscription, profitability, and cash flow growth, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses or to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, and successfully integrate such acquired businesses and technologies; \n\n&#8226; shift to named-user plans and annual billing of multi-year contracts; \n\n&#8226; potential goodwill impairment charges related to prior acquisitions; \n\n&#8226; failure to manage spend; \n\n&#8226; changes in billings linearity; \n\n&#8226; changes in subscription mix, pricing pressure, or changes in subscription pricing; \n\n&#8226; weak or negative growth in one or more of the industries we serve, including AEC, manufacturing, and digital media and entertainment markets; \n\n&#8226; the success of new business or sales initiatives; \n\n&#8226; security breaches, related reputational harm, and potential financial penalties to customers and government entities; \n\n&#8226; restructuring or other accounting charges and unexpected costs or other operating expenses; \n\n&#8226; timing of additional investments in our technologies or deployment of our services; \n\n&#8226; changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Securities and Exchange Commission, or other rulemaking bodies; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the effectiveness of our hedging activity; \n\n&#8226; dependence on and timing of large transactions; \n\n&#8226; adjustments arising from ongoing or future tax examinations; \n\n&#8226; the ability of governments around the world to adopt fiscal policies, meet their financial and debt obligations, and finance infrastructure projects; \n\n&#8226; failure to expand our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT customer base to related design products and services; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; our ability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms; \n\n&#8226; timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors; \n\n&#8226; the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels; \n\n&#8226; perceived or actual technical or other problems with a product or combination of subscriptions; \n\n&#8226; unexpected or negative outcomes of matters and expenses relating to litigation or regulatory inquiries; \n\n&#8226; increases in cloud functionality-related expenses; \n\n&#8226; timing of releases and retirements of offerings; \n\n&#8226; changes in tax laws or tax or accounting rules and regulations, such as increased use of fair value measures; \n\n&#8226; changes in sales compensation practices; \n\n&#8226; failure to effectively implement and maintain our copyright legalization programs, especially in developing countries; \n\n&#8226; renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements; \n\n&#8226; interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third-party developers; \n\n&#8226; timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities; \n\n&#8226; failure to achieve continued success in technology advancements; \n\n&#8226; catastrophic events, natural disasters, or public health events, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19; \n\n&#8226; regulatory compliance costs; and \n\n&#8226; failure to appropriately estimate the scope of services under consulting arrangements. \n\nWe have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions. In particular, our financial results in Europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period, and our APAC operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters. War, including the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy, could also affect our business. \n\nOur operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term. Accordingly, any revenue shortfall below expectations has had, and in the future could have, an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability. Greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability. \n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions, including our AutoCAD-based software products and collections, and if these offerings are not successful, our revenue would be adversely affected. \n\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings, including AutoCAD software, solutions based on AutoCAD, which include our collections that serve specific markets, and products that are interoperable with AutoCAD. Any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions, including the product release cycle, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, economic and market conditions, and the availability of third-party applications, would likely harm our financial results. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, combined revenue from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT family products, not including collections having AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT as a component, represented 28% and 29% of our total net revenue, respectively. \n\nFrom time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives; if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. \n\nAs part of our effort to accommodate our customers&#8217; needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology, from time to time we evolve our business and sales initiatives, such as shifting to annual billing of multi-year contracts, realigning our development and marketing organizations, offering software as a service, and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency. We may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and, at times, we have been met with short-term challenges in the execution of such initiatives. Market acceptance of any new business or sales \n\nTable of Contents \n\ninitiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers&#8217; needs at the right time and price. Often, we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis. If any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue, or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted. \n\nNet revenue, billings, earnings, cash flow, or subscriptions shortfalls or volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline. \n\nThe market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including the other risks described in these risk factors and the following: \n\n&#8226; shortfalls in our expected financial results, including net revenue, billings, earnings, and cash flow or key performance metrics, such as subscriptions, including as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations, including whether those results fail to meet, exceed, or significantly exceed securities analyst expectations; \n\n&#8226; quarterly variations in our or our competitors&#8217; results of operations; \n\n&#8226; general socioeconomic, political, or market conditions, including from an economic downturn or recession in the United States or in other countries; \n\n&#8226; changes in forward-looking estimates of future results, how those estimates compare to securities analyst expectations, or changes in recommendations or confusion on the part of analysts and investors about the short- and long-term impact to our business; \n\n&#8226; uncertainty about certain governments&#8217; abilities to repay debt or effect fiscal policy; \n\n&#8226; announcements of new offerings or enhancements by us or our competitors; \n\n&#8226; unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, regulatory actions, and litigation; \n\n&#8226; changes in laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business; \n\n&#8226; outstanding debt service obligations; and \n\n&#8226; other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors. \n\nSignificant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and time-consuming litigation. Historically, after periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation. This type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management&#8217;s attention and resources. \n\nAs a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development, our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners. \n\nWe partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities. We believe our partnering strategy allows us to achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings. This strategy creates a dependency on independent developers. Independent developers, including those who currently develop solutions for us in the United States and throughout the world, may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future. In addition, use of development resources through consulting relationships, particularly in non-U.S. jurisdictions with developing legal systems, may be adversely impacted by, and expose us to risks relating to, evolving employment, export, and intellectual property laws. These risks could, among other things, expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules. \n\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. \n\nSocial and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. Potential government regulation in the space of AI ethics may also \n\nTable of Contents \n\nincrease the burden and cost of research and development in this area, subjecting us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. Failure to address AI ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services. \n\nRisks Relating to Our Operations \n\nSecurity incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers&#8217; systems, solutions, offerings, services, applications, data, or intellectual property, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, create additional liability, and adversely impact our financial results. \n\nAs we digitize Autodesk and use cloud- and web-based technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience, we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to, or improper use of, our and our customers&#8217; information. Like other software offerings and systems, ours are vulnerable to security incidents, including those from acquired companies. Also, our ability to mitigate the security incident risk may be impacted by our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers and vendors, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers and vendors, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. We devote significant resources in an effort to maintain the security and integrity of our systems, offerings, services, and applications (online, mobile, and desktop), including by enhancing security features, conducting penetration tests, code hardening, releasing security vulnerability updates, and accelerating our incident response time. We also provide annual information security training to our employees. Despite these efforts, we may not prevent security incidents, and we may face delays or other difficulties in identifying, responding to, or remediating security incidents. \n\nHackers regularly have targeted our systems, offerings, services, and applications, and we expect them to do so in the future. To date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us or our customers, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. Security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems, solutions, offerings, applications, or services; cause errors in the output of our customers&#8217; work; allow unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, loss, or destruction of, sensitive data or intellectual property, including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers; or cause other destructive outcomes. The risk of a security incident, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. These threats include identity theft, unauthorized access, DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, malware, bugs, vulnerabilities, advanced persistent threats (APT), application-centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, social engineering, phishing, credential stuffing, malicious file uploads, backdoor trojans, supply chain attacks, ransomware attacks, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, vendors, partners, customers, or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers&#8217; or users&#8217; data and there is the risk of employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance. These existing risks are compounded given the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to work-from-home arrangements for a large population of employees and contractors, as well as employees and contractors of our third-party technology providers and vendors, and the risks could also be elevated in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine as we and our third-party technology providers and vendors are vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyberattacks from or affiliated with nation-state actors, including retaliatory attacks from Russian actors against U.S.-based companies. Despite our significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we cannot entirely mitigate these risks, and there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of such information will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to such information. \n\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of security incidents involving certain types of personal data and personal information. We are also contractually required to notify certain customers of certain security incidents. If any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur or to be perceived to have occurred, our reputation may suffer, our competitive position may be diminished, customers (including government customers) may stop paying for our solutions and services, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to evaluate and alleviate the security incident and to try to prevent further or additional incidents, and we could face regulatory inquiry, lawsuits, and potential liability. We could incur significant costs and liabilities, including due to litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a security incident, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. \n\nWe cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security incident. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be \n\nTable of Contents \n\navailable in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security incident, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. \n\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell subscriptions to access our products and subject us to possible litigation and greater security risks. \n\nWe use third-party open source software. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users, who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software, to make publicly available or to license all or part of such software (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code, such as modifications or derivative works created, based upon, incorporating, or using the open source software) under the terms of the particular open source license. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of the applicable license, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an increasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law to provide clarity on their proper legal interpretation. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. \n\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours. \n\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services; third-party security incidents could result in the loss of our or our customers&#8217; data, expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, and adversely impact our financial results. \n\nWe rely on third parties, such as Amazon Web Services, to provide us with operational and technical services. These third parties may have access to our systems, provide hosting services, or otherwise process data about us or our customers, employees, or partners. Our ability to monitor such third parties&#8217; security measures is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our such third parties&#8217; systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other disruption to, our or these third parties&#8217; systems. Any security incident involving such third parties could compromise the integrity or availability of, or result in the theft of, our and our customers&#8217; data. In addition, our operations or the operations of our customers or partners could be negatively affected in the event of a security incident and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information, including source code. Unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through break-ins, network breaches by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. If any of the foregoing were to occur or to be perceived to occur, our reputation may suffer, our competitive position may be diminished, customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services, we could face lawsuits, regulatory investigation, fines, and potential liability, and our financial results could be negatively impacted. \n\nDelays in service from third-party service providers could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, and adversely impact our financial results. \n\nFrom time to time, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for the provision of services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions. Inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our \n\nTable of Contents \n\nstrategy. If any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third-party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial results could be negatively impacted. \n\nWe are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize Autodesk and support our customers. Should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed. \n\nWe rely on our network and data center infrastructure, technology systems, and websites for our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. We continually invest resources to update and improve these systems to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers. In particular, our transition to cloud-based products and a subscription-only business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies, as well as back-office systems for technical, financial, compliance, and sales resources. Such improvements are often complex, costly, and time consuming. In addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with those systems. Unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations, loss of customers, loss of revenue, errors in our accounting and financial reporting, or damage to our reputation, all of which could harm our business. \n\nOur software solutions are highly complex and may contain undetected errors, defects, or vulnerabilities, and are subject to service disruptions, degradations, outages or other performance problems, each of which could harm our business and financial performance. \n\nThe software solutions that we offer are complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors, defects, or vulnerabilities. Some errors, defects, or vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, degradations, outages, and other performance problems in connection with our software solutions. \n\nAny errors, defects, vulnerabilities, service disruptions, degradations, outages or other performance problems could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions, damage to our reputation, damage to our customers&#8217; businesses, loss of revenue, an increase in subscription cancellations, or lack of market acceptance of our offerings, any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance \n\nIf we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel, or if our distribution channel suffers financial losses, becomes financially unstable or insolvent, or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions, our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected. \n\nWe sell our software products both directly to end users and through a network of distributors and resellers. For both fiscal 2023 and 2022, approximately 65% of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers, and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future. Our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network. Computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized, and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction as well as during the past several years. We have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them. In the past we have taken steps to support them, and may take additional steps in the future, such as extending credit terms and adjusting our incentives. These steps, if taken, could harm our financial results. If our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent, they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services, which would negatively impact our business and revenue. \n\nWe rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions. Of our distributors, Tech Data accounted for 37% and 36% of our total net revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and Ingram Micro accounted for 9% of our total net revenue for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. During October and November 2022, we entered into transition agreements with each of Tech Data and Ingram Micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. In connection with such transition agreements, we intend to increase our selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. During the transition period, we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through Tech Data and Ingram Micro will be able to continue to do so, and following the transition period, we believe such resellers and end users will be able to continue to purchase our products from our value-added resellers, our agents or from one of our many other distributors or directly from Autodesk, in each case under substantially the same terms and without substantial disruption to our revenue. However, if during the transition period, Tech Data or Ingram Micro \n\nTable of Contents \n\nwere to experience a significant business disruption or if our relationship with either were to significantly deteriorate, it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would, at least temporarily, be negatively impacted. Also, if any of our assumptions about our end users, value added resellers, distributors, or agents or our direct selling capabilities proves incorrect, these changes could harm our business. This could, in turn, negatively impact our financial results. \n\nOver time, we have modified and especially during the transition process noted above, we will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers, such as their incentive programs, pricing to them, and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives. Changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business. Further, our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business, move to competitive products, or not have the skills or ability to support customers. The loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business. In particular, if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us, we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers. These events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n\nWe rely on software from third parties, and a failure to properly manage our use of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue. \n\nMany of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. Such third-party software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and under public open source licenses. While we have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software, if such processes are inadequate, we may be subject to copyright infringement or other third-party claims. If we are non-compliant with a license for commercial software, we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement. In the case of open-source software licensed under certain &#8220;copyleft&#8221; licenses, the license itself, or a court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source software, may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed. This could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased costs, re-engineering of our software, damage to our reputation, or loss of revenue. \n\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, support, indemnities, assurances of title or controls on origin of the software, or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Likewise, some open source projects have known security and other vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities, or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability, and are provided on an &#8220;as-is&#8221; basis. \n\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel. \n\nOur success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, professional, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Historically, competition for these key personnel has been intense. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions, inability to retain and attract qualified employees in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals. \n\nWe rely on third-party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies, our solutions and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted. \n\nWe rely on certain software that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the software may not be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors. The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain, and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed, identified, licensed, and integrated, which would likely harm our business. \n\nDisruptions in licensing relationships and with third-party developers could adversely impact our business. \n\nWe license certain key technologies from third parties. Licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms, if at all, and any failure to do so could harm our business. Our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third-party developers who provide products that expand the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nfunctionality of our design software. Some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn. In particular markets, such disruptions have in the past, and would likely in the future, negatively impact these third-party developers and end users, which could harm our business. \n\nTechnology created by outsourced product development, whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions, involves additional risks such as effective integration into existing products, adequate transfer of technology know-how, and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property. \n\nRisks Relating to Laws and Regulations \n\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy, data protection, and information security issues and new and expanding laws may impact our business and expose us to increased liability. \n\nOur strategy to digitize Autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud- and web-based technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers. To accomplish this strategy, we must collect and otherwise process customer data, which may include personal data and personal information of users from different jurisdictions globally. We also collect and otherwise process personal data and personal information of our employees and contractors. As a result, federal, state, and global laws relating to privacy, data protection, and information security apply to Autodesk&#8217;s personal data and personal information processing activities. The scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving, subject to differing interpretations, may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. Globally, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and the Personal Information Protection Law (&#8220;PIPL&#8221;) in China have been enacted. In addition, new and emerging state laws in the United States governing privacy, data protection, and information security, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (&#8220;VCDPA&#8221;), the Colorado Privacy Act (&#8220;CPA&#8221;), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;UCPA&#8221;), and Connecticut&#8217;s Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (&#8220;CTDPA&#8221;) have been enacted. These laws and regulations, as well as industry self-regulatory codes, create new compliance obligations and substantially expand the scope of potential liability and provide greater penalties for non-compliance. For example, the GDPR provides for penalties of up to &#8364;20 million or 4% of a company&#8217;s annual global revenue, whichever is greater, the PIPL provides for penalties of up to 50 million renminbi or 5% of a company's annual revenue and disgorgement of all illegal gains, whichever is greater, and the CCPA provides for penalties of up to $7,500 per violation. These laws, regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of expanded obligations in our contracts. \n\nIn addition, there is continued instability of international personal data transfer legal mechanisms that are complex, uncertain, and subject to active litigation and enforcement actions in a number of jurisdictions around the world. For example, on June 4, 2021, the European Commission published a new set of modular standard contractual clause (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;), providing for an 18-month implementation period, which became effective on June 29, 2021, and imposes on companies obligations relating to personal data transfers, including the obligation to conduct a transfer impact assessment and, depending on a party&#8217;s role in the transfer, to implement additional security measures and to update internal privacy practices. We may, in addition to other impacts, be required to expend significant time and resources to update our contractual arrangements and to comply with new obligations, and we face exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions in connection with transfers of personal data from the EU. \n\nIn addition, the United Kingdom&#8217;s (&#8220;UK&#8221;) exit from the EU, and ongoing developments in the UK, have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. Data processing in the UK is now governed by the UK General Data Protection Regulation and supplemented by other domestic data protection laws, such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018, which authorizes fines of up to &#163;17.5 million or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is higher. We are also exposed to potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. Furthermore, the new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside the EU and not the UK. Although the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the UK on June 28, 2021, allowing the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, this decision will be regularly reviewed going forward and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws following its exit from the EU. On February 2, 2022, the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office issued new standard contractual clauses to support personal data transfers out of the UK (&#8220;UK SCCs&#8221;), which became effective March 21, 2022. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing personal data on our behalf or localize certain personal data. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nFurther, several European data protection authorities recently indicated that the use of Google Analytics by European website operators involves the unlawful transfer of personal data to the United States. As the enforcement landscape further develops, and depending on the impacts of these rulings and other developments with respect to cross-border data transfer, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, have to stop using certain tools and vendors, and make other operational changes. \n\nSeveral other countries, including China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border data transfers. There is also an increasing trend towards data localization policies. For example, in 2021, China introduced localization requirements for certain data. There are also other countries, such as India, that are considering data localization requirements. If this trend continues, and countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border personal data transfers (or do not permit personal data to leave the country of origin), it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations in those jurisdictions could be impacted. \n\nIn addition, the new state laws &#8211; the CPRA and the VCDPA &#8211; that became effective on January 1, 2023, the CPA and CTDPA that become effective on July 1, 2023, and the UCPA that becomes effective on December 31, 2023, introduce additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights. The CPRA also created a new agency to implement and enforce the law. These new state laws have required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to comply. Laws in all 50 states, and some of our contracts, require us to provide notice under certain circumstances to customers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. Also, if third parties we work with, such as suppliers, violate applicable data protection laws or regulations, such violations may also put our users&#8217; information at risk and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Additionally, in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Evolving legislation and the interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues and have and may cause variation in requirements, increase restrictions and potential legal risk and impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability. \n\nIn the EU and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are highly likely to be replaced by an EU regulation known as the ePrivacy Regulation, which is expected to significantly increase fines for non-compliance. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is under development, recent European case law and regulators&#8217; recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. This could lead to substantial costs, require significant system changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. Regulation of cookies and similar technologies, and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users, may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand our customers. \n\nGovernments, regulators, plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys, privacy advocates have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share, and transmit personal data and personal information. Any perception of our practices, products, offerings, or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection rights may subject us to public criticism, lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Moreover, because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are uncertain, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products, offerings, and services. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our offerings and services, any of which could require significant additional expense and adversely affect our business, including impacting our ability to innovate, delaying our development roadmap and adversely affecting our relationships with customers and our ability to compete. If we are obligated to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, offerings, or services, we may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner, or at all, and our ability to develop new products, offerings, and services could be limited. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur offerings are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations, governments, and persons targeted by applicable sanctions. While we have processes to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against U.S. government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Violations of applicable sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties. \n\nFor additional risks regarding sanctions and trade protectionism, please see the risk factor entitled &#8220;We are dependent on international revenue and operations . . .&#8221; earlier in this section. \n\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our business could be harmed. \n\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trademark laws, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. While we have patent applications pending in the United States and throughout the world, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties from time to time have copied or reverse engineered aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our software is time-consuming and costly. We are unable to measure the extent to which unauthorized use of our software exists and we expect that unauthorized use of software will remain a persistent problem, particularly in emerging economies. \n\nAdditionally, we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. Unauthorized disclosure of our source code could make it easier for third parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers, contractors, vendors, and partners. However, it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization. If this were to occur, it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights, and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted. \n\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights. \n\nOur competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our business. Third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights, even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights claimed against us. As more software patents are granted worldwide, the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows, and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims. Additionally, certain patent assertion entities have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents. \n\nAny claims or threats of infringement or misappropriation, whether with or without merit, have been and could in the future be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product delays, require us to change our products or business practices, prevent us from offering our software and services, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which would likely harm our business. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications, or refund fees, which could be costly. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or \n\nTable of Contents \n\nacquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. \n\nContracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process. \n\nWe provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities. Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes, and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results. \n\nRisks Relating to Financial Developments \n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. \n\nBecause we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. We use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow, revenue and expense exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, and other obligations, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. These foreign currency instruments may have maturities that extend for one to 18 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results. \n\nThe fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given period. Although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility, we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk, and in any case, will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. \n\nIn addition, global events, including the sudden and unexpected effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as geopolitical and economic developments, may contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets, which we may not be able to effectively manage, and our financial results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations, or such countries&#8217; currencies may be devalued, or both, which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results. \n\nOur debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. \n\nWe have $2.30 billion of principal debt, consisting of notes due at various times from June 2025 to December 2031, as of January 31, 2023, as described in Part II, Item 8. We also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, with an option to be increased up to $2.0 billion, as described in Part II, Item 8. Maintenance of our indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and additional issuances of indebtedness could: \n\n&#8226; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments&#894; \n\n&#8226; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions; \n\n&#8226; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; \n\n&#8226; impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate, or other purposes&#894; and \n\n&#8226; due to limitations within the debt instruments, restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of Autodesk and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially change our business, and incur subsidiary indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit agreement. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in Part II, Item 8, and any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing. \n\nOur investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors. If general economic conditions decline, this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate and illiquidity in the financial marketplace, and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments, leading to impairment in the value of our investments. \n\nIt is our policy to invest our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with, and in the custody of, financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security, or issuer. However, we are subject to general economic conditions, interest rate trends, and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments, the net realizable value of our investments (including our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities), and our ability to sell them. Any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges, which in turn could impact our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share. \n\nFrom time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. Investments in privately held companies are considered inherently risky. The technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies and, as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. \n\nA loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge. The effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share. In any of these scenarios, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business, taking advantage of opportunities, and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due. \n\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, and uncertainties in interpretation and application, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. \n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is primarily based on our geographic mix of earnings; statutory rates; stock-based compensation; intercompany arrangements, including the manner we develop, value, and license our intellectual property; and enacted tax rules. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate and cash taxes. \n\nTax laws in the United States and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. For example, the U.S. government enacted significant tax law changes in December 2017, the Tax Act, which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year, and significant tax legislation was included in the March 2020 CARES Act and subsequent Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2020. Due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the Tax Act and the CARES Act, the U.S. Department of Treasury and other standard-setting bodies have been issuing and will continue to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate effect on our results of operations from both the Tax Act and the CARES Act, including for our prior tax years. In addition, increases in corporate tax rates, could increase our effective tax rate, cash taxes and have an adverse effect on our results from operations. \n\nSigned into law on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act contains many provisions that may impact Autodesk, including the adjusted book minimum tax and excise tax on stock buybacks. We are assessing these impacts on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIncreasingly, tax authorities are reviewing existing corporate tax regulatory and legal regimes. Many countries in the European Union as well as other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are actively considering new taxing regimes and changes to existing tax laws. If U.S. or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted. \n\nIf we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our long-lived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our results of operations would be adversely affected. \n\nOur long-lived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. If impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair values, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would decrease the carrying value of our long-lived assets, adversely affecting our results of operations. Our deferred tax assets include net operating loss, amortizable tax assets, and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we assess the need for a valuation allowance, considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. We continue to have a valuation allowance against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Changes in the amount of the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions valuation allowance could also result in a material non-cash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted, and our results of operations could be materially affected. We will continue to perform these tests on our worldwide deferred tax assets, and any future adjustments to the realizability of our deferred tax assets may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nOur business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. \n\nOur business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure, our internal technology systems, and our websites. We also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use. The failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, weather event, telecommunications failure, power failure, cyber attack, terrorism or war (including the significant military action against Ukraine launched by Russia and any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy), or business interruption from epidemics or pandemics, or the fear of such events, could adversely impact our business, financial results, and financial condition. For example, our corporate headquarters and executive offices are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area and face annual periods of wildfire danger, which increase the probability of power outages and may impact employees&#8217; abilities to commute to work or to work from home. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event; however, there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations. In addition, any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products. This could in turn decrease that country&#8217;s or region&#8217;s demand for our products, negatively impacting our financial results. \n\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business, and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the trading prices for our securities. \n\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies. As the global economy has changed and our business has evolved, we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries. Like many other technology companies, the number and frequency of inquiries from U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices, as well as the business practices of others in our industry, have increased in recent years. In the event we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes. Any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in high defense costs, damage awards, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. In any such event, our financial results, results of operations, cash flows, or trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nChanges in existing financial accounting standards or practices, or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nChanges in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective. \n\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. \n\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. This assessment must include a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price. \n\nIn preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. \n\nWe make assumptions, judgments, and estimates for a number of items, including revenue recognition for product subscriptions and enterprise business arrangements (&#8220;EBAs&#8221;), the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, goodwill, financial instruments including strategic investments, long-lived assets, and intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, and the fair value of stock awards. We also make assumptions, judgments, and estimates in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, variable compensation, partner incentive programs, product returns reserves, allowances for credit losses, asset retirement obligations, legal contingencies, and operating lease liabilities. These assumptions, judgments, and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. \n\n"

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#8217;S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nMARKET INFORMATION FOR COMMON STOCK \n\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ADSK. \n\nDIVIDEND POLICY \n\nWe anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, we will not pay any cash or stock dividends. \n\nSTOCKHOLDERS \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, the number of common stockholders of record was 312. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders. \n\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nAutodesk&#8217;s stock repurchase programs provide Autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time, and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. Under the share repurchase programs, Autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers, or by other means. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price, and legal and regulatory requirements. \n\nIn November 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of the Company's common stock, in addition to the shares remaining under previously announced share repurchase programs. \n\nThe following table provides information about the repurchase of common stock in open-market transactions during the quarter ended January 31, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START (Shares in thousands) Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs(1) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs(2) November 1 - November 30 259 $ 196.34 259 3,496 December 1 - December 31 575 191.72 575 2,921 January 1 - January 31 253 193.43 253 2,668 Total 1,087 $ 193.21 1,087 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(1) Represents shares purchased in open-market transactions under the stock repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors. \n\n(2) These amounts correspond to the plans publicly announced and approved by the Board of Directors in September 2016 and November 2022 that authorize the repurchase of 30 million shares and $5 billion, respectively. At January 31, 2023, 3 million shares and $5 billion remained available for repurchase under the September 2016 and November 2022 repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors, respectively.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth above in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and elsewhere in this report. See &#8220;Forward-Looking Information&#8221; immediately preceding Part I. \n\nSTRATEGY \n\nAutodesk is changing how the world is designed and made. Our technology spans architecture, engineering, construction, product design, manufacturing, media and entertainment, empowering innovators everywhere to solve challenges big and small. From greener buildings to smarter products to more mesmerizing blockbusters, Autodesk technology helps our customers to design and make a better world for all. \n\nOur strategy is to build enduring customer relationships, delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make processes. To drive the execution of our strategy, we are focused on three strategic priorities: deliver a world-class customer experience, catalyze our customers&#8217; digital transformation, and establish an industry-leading platform for Design and Make. \n\nWe equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools, services, and access they need for success today and tomorrow. At every step, we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining, collaborating, and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers, for society, and for the world. And because creativity can&#8217;t flourish in silos, we connect what matters - from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform. \n\nAutodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. We have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon software for the personal computer. Just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the hardware industry, the software industry has transitioned from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. \n\nProduct Evolution \n\nWe offer subscriptions for individual products and Industry Collections, enterprise business arrangements (&#8220;EBAs&#8221;), and cloud service offerings (collectively referred to as &#8220;subscription plans&#8221;). Subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses. \n\nOur subscription plans represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. Our cloud offerings, for example, BIM 360, Autodesk Build, Fusion 360, ShotGrid, AutoCAD web app, and AutoCAD mobile app, provide tools, including mobile and collaboration capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing, and data management processes. We believe that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services. \n\nIndustry Collections provide our customers with access to a broader selection of Autodesk solutions and services, simplifying the customers&#8217; ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nTo support our strategic priority of digital transformation in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (&#8220;AEC&#8221;), we are strengthening our AEC solutions&#8217; foundation with both organic and inorganic investments. In fiscal 2023, we acquired a cloud-connected, extended reality (XR) platform enabling AEC professionals to present, collaborate and review projects in immersive and interactive experiences, from anywhere and at any time. This acquisition enables Autodesk to meet increasing needs for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology advancements within the AEC industry and further support AEC customers throughout the project delivery lifecycle. In fiscal 2022, we acquired Storm UK Holdco Limited, the parent of Innovyze, Inc. (&#8220;Innovyze&#8221;), which provides water infrastructure software. Combining Innovyze&#8217;s hydraulic modeling, simulation, asset performance management and operational analytics solutions with Autodesk&#8217;s design and analysis solutions (including Autodesk Civil 3D, Autodesk InfraWorks, and the Autodesk Construction Cloud) enables us to deliver end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our water infrastructure customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. Other acquisitions in fiscal 2022 include a cloud-based estimating solution that enables construction teams to create estimates, perform digital takeoffs, generate detailed reports and proposals and manage bid-day processes. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we launched Autodesk Tandem, a cloud-based digital twin technology platform that extends digital project delivery by providing owner/operators with an easy to use, accurate, digital as-built model of a newly built or renovated facility. For owner/operators, this accelerates operational readiness and extends the value of BIM downstream into the owner/operator segment. \n\nIn manufacturing, our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. We continue to attract global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and cloud-based Fusion 360 that converges the design process with manufacturing. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, we acquired a maker of software for optimizing manufacturing processes with automation and digitization from the shop floor upward that provides a real-time system of record for data collection, management, and analysis. In fiscal 2022, we acquired Upchain, an instant-on, cloud-based data management technology that allows product design and manufacturing customers to collaborate in the cloud across their value chains and bring products to market faster. \n\nOur strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available. \n\nGlobal Reach \n\nWe sell our products and services globally, through a combination of indirect and direct channels. Our indirect channels include value added resellers, direct market resellers, distributors, and other software developers. We entered into transition agreements with each of our distributors Tech Data and Ingram Micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. In connection with the transition agreements, Autodesk intends to increase its selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. Our direct channels include internal sales resources focused on selling in our largest accounts, our highly specialized solutions, and business transacted through our online Autodesk branded store. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2, \"Revenue Recognition\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. \n\nWe anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online Autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards direct-only business models. Additionally, as part of the continued growth of our online Autodesk branded store and the transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts and our new token-based Flex model, we are planning to expand our transactions with value-added resellers and transact directly with more end customers without substantial disruption to our revenue. We expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support a considerable portion of our customers. We also expect our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. We employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies. \n\nOne of our key strategies is to maintain an API based architecture of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. This approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. We offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. For example, we have established the Autodesk Platform Services to support \n\nTable of Contents \n\ninnovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed, made, and used. \n\nIn addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period. This network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets worldwide. Our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our solutions quickly and easily. We have a significant number of registered third-party developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications. \n\nImpact at Autodesk \n\nAutodesk is committed to advancing a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable world. We don&#8217;t believe in waiting for progress, we believe in making it. We take action as a business and to support our employees, customers, and communities in our collective opportunity to design and make a better world for all. \n\nWe focus our efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas: energy and materials, health and resilience, and work and prosperity. These impact opportunity areas are derived from the UN Sustainable Development Goals (&#8220;SDGs&#8221;) and have been focused through a multi-pronged process to align the top needs of our stakeholders, the important issues of our business, and the areas we are best placed to accelerate positive impact at scale. \n\nThese opportunities manifest as outcomes through how our customers leverage our technology to design and make net-zero carbon buildings, resilient infrastructure, more sustainable products, and a thriving workforce. We realize these opportunities through powering our business with 100% renewable energy, neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions and developing an inclusive culture. We advance these opportunities with industry innovators through collaboration, philanthropic capital, software donations, and training. \n\nThe Autodesk Foundation (the &#8220;Foundation&#8221;), a privately funded 501(c)(3) charity organization established and solely funded by us, leads our philanthropic efforts. The purpose of the Foundation is twofold: to support employees to make a better world by matching employees&#8217; volunteer time and/or donations to nonprofit organizations; and to support organizations using design to drive positive social and environmental impact. On our behalf, the Foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations, social and environmental entrepreneurs, and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future. \n\nAdditional information about our environmental, social, and governance program is available in our annual impact report on our website at www.autodesk.com. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this report. \n\nAssumptions Behind Our Strategy \n\nOur strategy depends upon many assumptions, including: making our technology available to mainstream markets; leveraging our large global network of distributors, resellers, agents, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students; improving the performance and functionality of our products and platform; and adequately protecting our intellectual property. If the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. For further discussion regarding these and related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An \n\nTable of Contents \n\naccounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRevenue Recognition - &#160; Judgments with Multiple Performance Obligations. Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities. \n\nFor our product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business arrangements, the functional nature of the promise, as well as the customers&#8217; value expectations, led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation. There is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities, which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with third-party cloud service providers. Furthermore, customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities. \n\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (&#8220;SSP&#8221;) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. \n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance. In these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel to determine the SSP. \n\nStrategic Investments. Strategic investment debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is adjusted for our strategic investment equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee. \n\nThese assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value. \n\nWe assess our strategic investment debt and equity securities portfolio quarterly for impairment. Strategic investment equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance, and any other readily available market data. For any available-for-sale debt securities, if Autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that Autodesk will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, Autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors. The credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. Impairment will be assessed at the individual security level. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to &#8220;Interest and other expense, net&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nFor our quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities, the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors \n\nTable of Contents \n\nincluding: the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, the investee&#8217;s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee&#8217;s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. \n\nBusiness Combinations. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with Autodesk&#8217;s &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221; policy in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; Note 1 &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. \n\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results. Examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the assets&#8217; useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: \n\n&#8226; future expected cash flows from subscriptions and maintenance agreements, sales, and acquired developed technologies; \n\n&#8226; the acquired company's trade name and patents, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and patents will continue to be used in our product portfolio; \n\n&#8226; expected growth in revenue from the acquired company&#8217;s existing customer relationships; \n\n&#8226; expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; \n\n&#8226; uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and \n\n&#8226; discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows. \n\nRealizability of Long-Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget, shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, and the results of past impairment reviews. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets. \n\nWe assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. \n\nThe key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset group over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. \n\nVariances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values. \n\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. Under this method, deferred tax assets, including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits, and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recovered. The valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for or release of a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. \n\nAs we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the Netherlands, Australia, California, Michigan and U.S. capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized. Each quarter we will continue to evaluate the positive and negative evidence of our ability to utilize our global deferred tax assets. \n\nLoss Contingencies . As described in Part I, Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Due to inherent uncertainties related to these matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nSee Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOVERVIEW OF FISCAL 2023 \n\n&#8226; Total net revenue was $5.01 billion during fiscal 2023, an increase of 14% compared to the prior fiscal year. \n\n&#8226; Recurring revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 98% for both fiscal years ending January 31, 2023 and 2022. \n\n&#8226; Net revenue retention rate (&#8220;NR3&#8221;) was within the range of 100% and 110% as of both January 31, 2023 and 2022. \n\n&#8226; Deferred revenue was $4.58 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the prior fiscal year. \n\n&#8226; Remaining performance obligations (short-term and long-term deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred revenue) (&#8220;RPO&#8221;) was $5.62 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year. \n\n&#8226; Current remaining performance obligations were $3.52 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior fiscal year. \n\nRevenue Analysis \n\nDuring fiscal 2023, net revenue increased 14%, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a 15% increase in subscription revenue, partially offset by a 14% decrease in maintenance revenue. \n\nFurther discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading &#8220;Results of Operations.&#8221; \n\nWe rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the United States and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, &#8220;Tech Data&#8221;) and Ingram Micro Inc. (&#8220;Ingram Micro&#8221;). Total sales to Tech Data accounted for 37%, 36%, and 37% of Autodesk&#8217;s total net revenue during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ingram Micro accounted for 9%, 9%, and 10% of Autodesk's total net revenue during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our customers through Tech Data and Ingram Micro are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscriptions and services. We entered into transition agreements with each of our distributors Tech Data and Ingram Micro to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. In connection with the transition agreements, Autodesk intends to increase our selling efforts with value-added resellers and agents. Consequently, we believe our business is not substantially dependent on Tech Data or Ingram Micro. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRecurring Revenue and Net Revenue Retention Rate \n\nIn order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics, including recurring revenue and NR3. These metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as these metrics are not intended to be combined with those items. We use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. Our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. The presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the &#8220;Glossary of Terms&#8221; for the definitions of these metrics in Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221;. \n\nThe following table outlines our recurring revenue metric for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Change compared to prior fiscal year end Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Change compared to prior fiscal year end Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 $ % $ % \n\nRecurring Revenue (in millions) (1) (2) \n\n$ 4,907 $ 612 14 % $ 4,295 $ 564 15 % $ 3,731 As a percentage of net revenue 98 % N/A N/A 98 % N/A N/A 98 % ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;________________ \n\n(1) The acquisition of a business may cause variability in the comparison of recurring revenue in this table above and recurring revenue derived from the revenue reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\n(2) The prior period amount has been adjusted to conform to current period presentation for a change in presentation of certain subscription plan offerings. See Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for further detail. \n\nNR3 was within the range of 100% and 110% as of both January 31, 2023 and 2022. \n\nForeign Currency Analysis \n\nWe generate a significant amount of our revenue in the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Finland. \n\nThe following table shows the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on our net revenue and total spend: ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Percent change compared to prior fiscal year (as reported) Constant currency percent change compared to prior fiscal year (1) Positive/negative/neutral impact from foreign exchange rate changes Net revenue 14 % 15 % Negative Total spend 7 % 8 % Positive ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;________________ \n\n(1) Please refer to the &#8220;Glossary of Terms&#8221; in Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8221; for the definitions of our constant currency growth rates. \n\nChanges in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, total spend, and income from operations in future periods. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the U.S. dollar. \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations \n\nRPO represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services, license, and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized. Unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2, &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221; for more details on Autodesk's performance obligations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Deferred revenue $ 4,580 $ 3,790 Unbilled deferred revenue 1,043 949 RPO \n\n$ 5,623 $ 4,739 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nRPO consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) January 31, 2022 January 31, 2021 Current RPO $ 3,518 $ 3,141 Non-current RPO 2,105 1,598 RPO \n\n$ 5,623 $ 4,739 ##TABLE_END\n\nWe expect that the amount of RPO will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration, and size of customer subscription and support agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, the frequency of the billing installments, and foreign currency fluctuations. Historically, we have had increased EBA sales activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may affect the relative value of our billings, RPO, and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters. \n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Items \n\nAt January 31, 2023, we had $2.17 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash flow from operations increased to $2.07 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, from $1.53 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. We repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $1.08 billion during fiscal 2023. Comparatively, we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock for $1.09 billion during fiscal 2022. Further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOverview \n\nWe believe our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, give us a robust foundation to successfully navigate complex geopolitical and global macro-economic challenges. However, supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, a global labor shortage, the ebb and flow of COVID-19, including in specific geographies, the war in Ukraine, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, may impact our outlook. We also expect our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. The extent of the impact of these risks on our business in fiscal 2024 and beyond will depend on several factors, some of which are out of our control. Further discussion of the potential impacts of these risks on our business can be found in Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work and we moved to a more hybrid workforce resulting in an evaluation of our office space needs. Accordingly, we reduced our facilities portfolio worldwide and incurred charges associated with our operating leases for real estate during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. See Part II, Item 8, Note 9, &#8220;Leases&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Optimizing our facilities costs allows us to deploy capital better to further our strategy and drive growth. However, there is no guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business, including any cost savings or operational efficiencies. \n\nNet Revenue by Income Statement Presentation \n\nSubscription revenue consists of our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible EBAs. Revenue from these arrangements is predominately recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. \n\nMaintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license. Under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades, when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the agreements, which is generally one year. \n\nOther revenue consists of revenue from consulting, training, and other products and services, and is recognized as the products are delivered and services are performed. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Change compared to prior fiscal year Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Management Comments (in millions, except percentages) $ % Net revenue (1): Subscription $ 4,651 $ 591 15 % $ 4,060 Increase due to growth in the subscriber base across subscription types, led by subscription renewal revenue with current-year subscription renewals reflecting new subscriptions sold in prior periods.

The decrease was primarily due to an increase in gains on foreign currency in the current period compared to the prior fiscal year due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal year 2022 and losses in the current period as compared to gains in the prior year for investments in debt and equity securities that are held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans. \n\nInterest and other expense, net, decreased by $29 million during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to gains on dispositions, mark-to-market gains, and a decrease in impairments of strategic investment equity securities in the current period as compared to the prior period offset in part by an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal 2022 and a decrease in mark-to market gains on debt and equity securities held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans. \n\nInterest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash, marketable securities, debt balances, average maturities, and interest rates. \n\nGains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of re-measuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity. The amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nWe account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. Furthermore, on January 22, 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) provisions of the TCJA. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company has elected to recognize any potential GILTI obligations as an expense in the period it is incurred. \n\nIncome tax expense was $123 million and $68 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, relative to pre-tax income of $946 million and $565 million, respectively, for the same periods. The tax expense for fiscal 2023 consists primarily of the U.S. and foreign tax expense, including withholding tax, an increase in tax expense relating to stock-based compensation, final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations enacted in fiscal 2023, offset by the benefit from the Canada valuation allowance release and a U.S. foreign derived intangible income benefit driven by capitalization of research and development expenditures starting in fiscal 2023 as required by the Tax Act. Tax expense for fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of the U.S. and foreign tax expense, including withholding tax, offset by shared-based compensation deductions, India withholding tax refunds and generation of federal tax credits. \n\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered. The valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn fiscal 2016, we considered cumulative losses in the U.S. from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence. Considering this negative evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the U.S. deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Foreign operations in the Netherlands and Canada that generated interest expense, future creditable research in excess of earnings, respectively, also resulted in the historic recording of a full valuation under the more likely than not realizability criteria. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the U.S., resulting in a $679 million non-cash benefit to earnings. We released the U.S. valuation allowance in fiscal 2021 due to the following positive evidence: \n\n&#8226; Recent history of worldwide pre-tax earnings, including cumulative earnings on a worldwide basis as of fiscal 2021 \n\n&#8226; Recent history of U.S. taxable income \n\n&#8226; Forecast of worldwide and U.S. pre-tax earnings, including a forecast of cumulative earnings in the U.S. jurisdiction \n\n&#8226; Forecast of U.S. taxable income \n\n&#8226; Reversal of deferred tax liabilities \n\nWe released our Canada valuation allowance in fiscal 2023 due to positive evidence supporting the utilization of the R&#38;D credits before they expire, resulting in a $38 million non-cash benefit to earnings. \n\nWe have retained a valuation allowance against California and Michigan deferred tax assets as well as deferred tax assets that will convert into a capital loss upon reversal as we do not have sufficient income of the appropriate character to benefit these deferred tax assets. Also, the Company continues to retain a valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets in the Netherlands and Australia. \n\nAs we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, that it is more likely than not that the Netherlands, Australia, California, Michigan, and U.S. capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized. \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, we had $223 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $38 million would reduce our valuation allowance, if recognized. The remaining $185 million would impact the effective tax rate. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months for statute lapse of approximately $4 million. \n\nOur future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws. A significant amount of our earnings are generated by our European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. \n\nSigned into law on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act contains many revisions to the Internal Revenue Code effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, including a 15% corporate minimum income tax and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations. Autodesk is currently assessing the impact the Inflation Reduction Act will have on our consolidated financial statements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION \n\nIn addition to our results determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) discussed above, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, our gross profit, income from operations, operating margin, net income, and diluted net income per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were as follows (in millions except for operating margin and per share data): \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2021 (Unaudited) Gross profit $ 4,525 $ 3,968 $ 3,453 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 4,624 $ 4,054 $ 3,508 Income from operations $ 989 $ 618 $ 629 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 1,785 $ 1,397 $ 1,112 Operating margin 20 % 14 % 17 % Non-GAAP operating margin 36 % 32 % 29 % Net income $ 823 $ 497 $ 1,208 Non-GAAP net income $ 1,445 $ 1,126 $ 900 Diluted net income per share $ 3.78 $ 2.24 $ 5.44 Non-GAAP diluted net income per share $ 6.63 $ 5.07 $ 4.05 ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in period-to-period comparisons, we use non-GAAP measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. We also use non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits, credits, expenses, and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. For the reasons set forth below, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to analyze the health of our business. This allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. We also use some of these measures for purposes of determining company-wide incentive compensation. \n\nThere are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \n\n(In millions except for operating margin, and per share data): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 (Unaudited) Gross profit $ 4,525 $ 3,968 $ 3,453 Stock-based compensation expense 46 35 23 Amortization of developed technologies 53 50 31 Acquisition-related costs &#8212; 1 1 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 4,624 $ 4,054 $ 3,508 Income from operations $ 989 $ 618 $ 629 Stock-based compensation expense 660 559 399 Amortization of developed technologies 53 50 31 Amortization of purchased intangibles 40 40 38 Acquisition-related costs 10 26 15 Lease-related asset impairments and other charges \n\n33 104 &#8212; Non-GAAP income from operations $ 1,785 $ 1,397 $ 1,112 Operating margin 20 % 14 % 17 % Stock-based compensation expense 13 % 13 % 11 % Amortization of developed technologies 1 % 1 % 1 % Amortization of purchased intangibles 1 % 1 % 1 % Acquisition-related costs &#8212; % 1 % &#8212; % Lease-related asset impairments and other charges \n\n1 % 2 % &#8212; % Non-GAAP operating margin (1) 36 % 32 % 29 % Net income $ 823 $ 497 $ 1,208 Stock-based compensation expense 660 559 399 Amortization of developed technologies 53 50 31 Amortization of purchased intangibles 40 40 38 Acquisition-related costs 10 26 15 Lease-related asset impairments and other charges \n\n33 104 &#8212; (Gain) loss on strategic investments and dispositions, net (1) (3) 41 Release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (38) &#8212; (679) Discrete GAAP tax items 28 (72) (44) Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (163) (75) (109) Non-GAAP net income $ 1,445 $ 1,126 $ 900 Diluted net income per share $ 3.78 $ 2.24 $ 5.44 Stock-based compensation expense 3.03 2.52 1.80 Amortization of developed technologies 0.24 0.22 0.14 ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 (Unaudited) Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.18 0.18 0.17 Acquisition-related costs 0.05 0.11 0.07 Lease-related asset impairments and other charges \n\n0.15 0.47 &#8212; (Gain) loss on strategic investments and dispositions, net &#8212; (0.01) 0.18 Release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (0.18) &#8212; (3.06) Discrete GAAP tax items 0.13 (0.32) (0.20) Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (0.75) (0.34) (0.49) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share $ 6.63 $ 5.07 $ 4.05 ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________ \n\n(1) Totals may not sum due to rounding. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may exclude the following: \n\nStock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses from non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies. \n\nAmortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles. We incur amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by both the timing and size of our acquisitions. Management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods. \n\nCEO transition costs. We exclude amounts paid to the Company&#8217;s former CEOs upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements, including severance payments, acceleration of restricted stock units, and continued vesting of performance stock units, and legal fees incurred with the transition. Also excluded from our non-GAAP measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new CEO. These costs represent non-recurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses. We further believe that excluding the CEO transition costs from our non-GAAP results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability. \n\nGoodwill impairment. This is a non-cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there is an indication that the asset has been impaired. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. \n\nRestructuring and other exit costs, net. These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, the closure of facilities, and cancellation of certain contracts. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. \n\nLease-related asset impairments and other charges.&#8239; &#8239;These charges are associated with the optimization of our facilities costs related to leases for facilities that we have recently vacated as a result of our one-time move to a more hybrid remote workforce. In connection with these facility leases, we recognize costs related to the impairment or abandonment of operating lease right-of-use assets, computer equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements, and other costs. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAcquisition-related costs. We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including due diligence costs, professional fees in connection with an acquisition, certain financing costs, and certain integration-related expenses. These expenses are unpredictable, and depend on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our Company. In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs. We believe excluding acquisition-related costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the Company's historical operating results and to other companies in our industry. \n\nLoss (gain) on strategic investments and dispositions. We exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions of strategic investments, purchased intangibles, and businesses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results. Included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses, dividends received, realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments, and gain and loss on dispositions. We believe excluding these items is useful to investors because they do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly. \n\nDiscrete tax provision items. We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-GAAP measure of net income (loss), and include a non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate. Discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. Examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax law. Management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. We believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance. \n\nEstablishment (release) of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets. This is a non-cash charge to record or to release a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. As explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. \n\nIncome tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses. The income tax effects that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, and restructuring charges and other exit costs (benefits) for GAAP and non-GAAP measures. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nOur primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities, and overhead costs. Long-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; repayment of debt; common stock repurchases; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications. \n\nAt January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $2.17 billion and net accounts receivable of $961 million. \n\nIn November 2022, Autodesk entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (&#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) by and among Autodesk, the lenders party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as agent, that provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion with an option to be increased up to $2.0 billion. The revolving credit facility is available for working capital or other business needs. The maturity date on the Credit Agreement is September 30, 2026. At January 31, 2023, Autodesk had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, as of March 14, 2023, we have no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, &#8220;Borrowing Arrangements,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement, we may not be able to draw on our revolving credit facility. \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, we had $2.30 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8220;Borrowing Arrangements,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup and its global affiliates. In addition, Citibank N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. \n\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of January 31, 2023, approximately 59% of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. There are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions, or adverse tax costs. The Tax Act included a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the United States with little to no incremental U.S. taxes. We regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed. We expect to meet our liquidity needs through or in combination of current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings. \n\nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A,&#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report. \n\nOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. See Part II, Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#8221; for further discussion. \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal year ended January 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,071 $ 1,531 $ 1,437 Net cash used in investing activities (143) (1,595) (404) Net cash used in financing activities (1,487) (169) (1,047) ##TABLE_END\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $2,071 million for fiscal 2023, primarily consisted of $823 million of our net income adjusted for $556 million non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense, lease-related asset impairment charges, and deferred income tax. The increase in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to a net increase in deferred revenue of $798 million driven by an increase in product subscriptions and EBA offerings offset in part by a change in accounts receivable of 247 million due to the seasonality of our billings in the fourth fiscal quarter and timing of cash collections from customers. \n\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $1,531 million for fiscal 2022, primarily consisted of $497 million of our net income adjusted for $817 million non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense, lease-related asset impairment charges, and deferred income tax. The increase in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to: a net increase in deferred revenue of $419 million driven by an increase in product subscriptions and EBA offerings and a decrease in maintenance subscriptions offset in part by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $134 million primarily due to the timing of payments for operating expenses. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $143 million for fiscal 2023 and was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities and business combinations, net of cash acquired, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,595 million for fiscal 2022 and was primarily due to business combinations, net of cash acquired, and purchases of marketable securities. \n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,487 million in fiscal 2023 and was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and repayment of debt. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $169 million in fiscal 2022 and was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock. \n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2023, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal years 2025-2026 Fiscal years 2027-2028 Thereafter Management Comments Notes payable $ 2,720 $ 69 $ 430 $ 601 $ 1,620 Notes payable consist of the notes issued in June 2015, June 2017, January 2020, and October 2021 including interest.

Operating leases 417 94 142 77 104 \n\nOperating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for real estate, vehicles, and certain equipment. See Part II, Item 8, Note 9, &#8220;Leases,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nPurchase obligations 287 130 105 37 15 Purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding to Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations relate primarily to acquisition of cloud services, commitments related to our investment agreements with limited liability partnership funds, and marketing. Deferred compensation obligations 86 7 17 14 48 Deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. See Part II, Item 8, Note 7, &#8220;Deferred Compensation,&#8221; in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this plan. Pension obligations 32 3 6 6 17 Pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the United States.

Asset retirement obligations 12 2 6 1 3 Asset retirement obligations represent the estimated costs to bring certain office buildings that we lease back to their original condition after the termination of the lease. Total (1) $ 3,554 $ 305 $ 706 $ 736 $ 1,807 ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(1) This table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue, and amounts related to income tax accruals for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see Part II, Item 8, Note 5, &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n\nPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. \n\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations. \n\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES \n\nAutodesk&#8217;s stock repurchase programs provide Autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. Under the share repurchase programs, Autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers, or by other means. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price, and legal and regulatory requirements. \n\nIn November 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $5 billion of the Company's common stock, in addition to the shares remaining under previously announced share repurchase programs. \n\nDuring the three and 12 months ended January 31, 2023, we repurchased 1 million and 5 million shares of our common stock, respectively. At January 31, 2023, 3 million shares and $5 billion remained available for repurchase under the September 2016 and November 2022 repurchase programs approved by the Board of Director, respectively. The plans do not have a fixed expiration dat e. See Part II, Item 8, Note 12, &#8220;Stock Repurchase Program,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK \n\nOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations. We utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. In addition, we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements generally within one to 12 months. Contracts were primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, British pounds, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, Swedish krona, and Czech koruna. We do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nOur option and foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of the respective period-ends are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Forward Contracts: Purchased $ 711 $ 13 $ 852 $ (10) Sold 1,755 (11) 1,612 7 Option Contracts: Purchased 904 5 1,273 18 Sold 974 (23) 1,322 (8) ##TABLE_END\n\nWe use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions. A sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2023, indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2023 and 2022, would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $149 million and $218 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2023 and 2022, would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $191 million and $138 million, respectively. \n\nINTEREST RATE RISK \n\nInterest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short-term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities. At January 31, 2023, we had $1.19 billion of cash equivalents and marketable securities, including $125 million classified as short-term marketable securities and $102 million classified as long-term marketable securities. If interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a 12-month period, the market value change of these securities would not have a material impact on our results of operations. \n\nOTHER MARKET RISK \n\nFrom time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. Privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky. The technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. See Part II, Item 8, Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding these strategic investments. \n\nFor information about exposure to counter-party credit-related losses, see Part II, Item 8, Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Concentration of Credit Risk.\" \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nBusiness \n\nAutodesk, Inc. (&#8220;Autodesk&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a global leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment technology solutions, spanning architecture, engineering, construction, product design, manufacturing, media, and entertainment. The Company&#8217;s sophisticated software products, offered through a hybrid of desktop and cloud functionality, enable its customers to design, fabricate, manufacture, and build anything by visualizing, simulating, and analyzing real-world performance early in the design process. These capabilities allow our customers to foster innovation, optimize their designs, streamline their manufacturing and construction processes, save time and money, improve quality, deliver more sustainable outcomes, communicate plans, and collaborate with others. Autodesk software products are sold globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Autodesk and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in Autodesk&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. On a regular basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. \n\nExamples of significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve revenue recognition for product subscriptions and enterprise business arrangements (&#8220;EBAs&#8221;), the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, goodwill, financial instruments including strategic investments, long-lived assets, and intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, and the fair value of stock awards. The Company also makes assumptions, judgments, and estimates in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, variable compensation, partner incentive programs, product returns reserves, allowances for credit losses, asset retirement obligations, legal contingencies, and operating lease liabilities. &#160; \n\nTable of Contents \n\nChange in presentation \n\nIn the current fiscal year, the Company changed its presentation of certain subscription plan offerings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue from subscription plan offerings in which the customer does not utilize the cloud functionality or that do not incorporate substantial cloud functionality, previously recorded in &#8220;Subscription&#8221; have been reclassified to &#8220;Other&#8221; and &#8220;Maintenance,&#8221; as applicable. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, in all material respects. These reclassifications did not impact total net revenue. \n\nThe effect of the change on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 &#160; As Reported Effect of Change in Presentation As Adjusted As Reported Effect of Change in Presentation As Adjusted Net revenue: Subscription $ 4,156 &#160; $ ( 96 ) $ 4,060 &#160; $ 3,479 &#160; $ ( 98 ) $ 3,381 &#160; Other 154 &#160; 96 &#160; 250 &#160; 128 &#160; 98 &#160; 226 &#160; Total net revenue 4,386 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,386 &#160; 3,790 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,790 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn the current fiscal year, the Company changed its rounding presentation to the nearest whole number in millions of reported amounts, except per share data or as otherwise noted. The current year rounding presentation has been applied to all prior year amounts presented and, in certain circumstances, this change may adjust previously reported balances. \n\nSegments \n\nAutodesk operates in one operating segment, and accordingly all required financial segment information is included in the consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Autodesk reports segment information based on the &#8220;management&#8221; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions, allocating resources, and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments. The Company's CODM allocates resources and assesses the operating performance of the Company as a whole. \n\nInformation regarding Autodesk's long-lived assets by geographic area were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 Long-lived assets (1): Americas U.S. $ 256 &#160; $ 323 &#160; Other Americas 13 &#160; 20 &#160; Total Americas 269 &#160; 343 &#160; Europe, Middle East, and Africa 72 &#160; 92 &#160; Asia Pacific 48 &#160; 32 &#160; Total long-lived assets $ 389 &#160; $ 467 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(1) Long-lived assets exclude deferred tax assets, marketable securities, goodwill, and intangible assets . \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nAutodesk&#8217;s revenue is divided into three categories: subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, and other revenue. Subscription revenue consists of our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible EBAs. Maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license. Under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades, when and if available, and technical support. Other revenue consists of revenue from consulting, training, and other products and services. Revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services. \n\nAutodesk&#8217;s contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether the products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment. Judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual components of desktop software applications and cloud functionalities. This determination influences whether the desktop software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation recognized at the time of delivery, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud functionalities as a single subscription performance obligation recognized over time. \n\nFor product subscriptions and flexible EBA subscriptions in which the desktop software and related cloud functionalities are highly interrelated, the single performance obligation is recognized ratably over the contract term as the subscription is delivered. For subscriptions involving distinct desktop software licenses, the license performance obligation is satisfied when delivered to our customers. For standalone maintenance subscriptions, cloud subscriptions, and technical support services, the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered. For consulting services, the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time as those services are delivered. \n\nWhen an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations which are concurrently delivered and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (the services transfer to the customer over the contract period), we account for those performance obligations as a single performance obligation. \n\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (&#8220;SSP&#8221;) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. \n\nOur indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where Autodesk sells to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. For these arrangements, transfer of control begins at the time access to our subscriptions is made available electronically to our customer, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. Judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. If we were to change this assessment, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. \n\nCosts to Obtain a Contract with a Customer \n\nSales commissions earned by our internal sales personnel and our reseller partners are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. The commission costs are capitalized and included in &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred costs are then amortized over the period of benefit. Autodesk determined that sales commissions earned by internal sales personnel that are related to contract renewals are commensurate with sales commissions earned on the initial contracts, and we determined the period of benefit to be the term of the respective customer contract. Commissions paid to our reseller partners that are related to contract renewals are not commensurate with commissions earned on the initial contract, and we determined the estimated period of benefit by taking into consideration customer retention data, customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. Amortization expense is included in marketing and sales expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nFair Value Measurement \n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining the fair value of our investments, we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques. Inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; \n\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and \n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require Autodesk to develop its own assumptions. \n\nThis hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. This is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities, which we consider to be Level 1 and Level 2 assets. \n\nKey inputs for currency derivatives are spot rates, forward rates, interest rates, volatility, and credit default rates. The spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet translations at the measurement date. Autodesk reviews for any potential changes on a quarterly basis, in conjunction with our fiscal quarter-end close. It is Autodesk&#8217;s assessment that the leveling best reflects current market activity when observing the pricing information for these assets. Autodesk&#8217;s Level 2 securities and derivatives are valued primarily using observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value derivatives using the observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted). Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient and when required, rates are interpolated from commonly quoted intervals published by market sources. See Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; for information. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nAutodesk considers all highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at estimated fair value. \n\nMarketable Securities and Strategic Investments \n\nAutodesk classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term generally based on each instrument&#8217;s underlying contractual maturity date. Generally, marketable securities with remaining maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Autodesk may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes or in anticipation of credit deterioration. \n\nMarketable securities are stated at fair value. Marketable securities maturing within one year that are not restricted are classified as current assets. \n\nAutodesk determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Autodesk carries all &#8220;available-for-sale securities&#8221; at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders&#8217; equity until disposition or maturity. Autodesk carries all &#8220;trading securities&#8221; at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, recorded in &#8220;Interest and other expense, net&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. \n\nThe company's strategic investments consist of privately held debt and equity securities. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nUnder the measurement alternative method, strategic investments in equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairments, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer in the current period. The carrying value is not adjusted for the Company&#8217;s strategic investments in equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. To determine if a transaction is deemed a similar investment, Autodesk considers the rights and obligations between the investments and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments with additional consideration for the stage of development of the investee company. The fair value would then be adjusted positively or negatively based on available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing. \n\nThe company&#8217;s strategic investments in debt and equity securities (Level 3) are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company&#8217;s judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available, when determining fair value. \n\nIn determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. In addition, the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including: the rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee. \n\nAll of Autodesk&#8217;s marketable securities and strategic investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Strategic investments in equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions, earnings, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. For any available-for-sale debt securities, if Autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that Autodesk will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, Autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors. The credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. Impairment will be assessed at the individual security level. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to &#8220;Interest and other expense, net&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nAutodesk does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables on available-for-sale debt securities separately. Autodesk writes off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income in the period deemed uncollectible in &#8220;Interest and other expense, net&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities is recorded in &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents,&#8221; &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets,&#8221; or &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as applicable. \n\nFor Autodesk&#8217;s quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio, the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including: the investee&#8217;s financial metrics, the investee&#8217;s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee&#8217;s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. \n\nFor additional information, see &#8220;Concentration of Credit Risk&#8221; within this Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments.&#8221; \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments \n\nUnder its risk management strategy, Autodesk uses derivative instruments to manage its short-term exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that exist as part of ongoing business operations. Autodesk&#8217;s general practice is to hedge a portion of transaction exposures primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, Swedish krona, Czech koruna and Indian rupees. These instruments generally have maturities between one and 12 months in the future. Autodesk uses foreign currency contracts not designated as \n\nTable of Contents \n\nhedging instruments and foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges but Autodesk does not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes. \n\nThe bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose Autodesk to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Autodesk only contracts with counterparties who meet the Company&#8217;s minimum requirements under its counterparty risk assessment process. Autodesk monitors counterparty risk on at least a quarterly basis and will adjust its exposure to various counterparties as necessary. Autodesk generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Autodesk does not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. \n\nAutodesk accounts for these derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carries them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings. \n\nIn addition to these foreign currency contracts, Autodesk holds derivative instruments issued by privately held companies, which are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivatives consist of certain conversion options on the convertible debt securities held by Autodesk or options to acquire equity securities in a privately held company. These derivatives are recorded at fair value as of each balance sheet date and are recorded in &#8220;Long-term other assets.&#8221; Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized in &#8220;Interest and other expense, net.&#8221; \n\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions \n\nThe assets and liabilities of Autodesk&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expense amounts are translated at exchange rates that approximate those rates in effect during the period in which the underlying transactions occur. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nGains and losses realized from foreign currency transactions, those transactions denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiary&#8217;s functional currency, are included in &#8220;Interest and other expense, net.&#8221; Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period, and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured based on historical exchange rates. \n\nForeign Currency Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges \n\nAutodesk uses foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. These currency collars and forward contracts are designated and documented as cash flow hedges. The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts is assessed quantitatively using regression at inception and thereafter. To receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge relationship and the hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The gains and losses on these hedges are included in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#8221; and are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, Autodesk reclassifies and discloses the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#8221; to &#8220;Interest and other expense, net&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements at that time. Derivative contracts and related gain (loss) are presented within &#8220;Net cash provided by operating activities&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. See Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; for additional information. \n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments \n\nAutodesk uses foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, and cash. These forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each fiscal quarter with gains and losses recognized as &#8220;Interest and other expense, net.&#8221; These derivative instruments do not subject the Company to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivative instruments are intended to offset the gains or losses resulting from the revaluation and settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, and cash. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAccounts Receivable, Net \n\nAccounts receivable, net, consisted of the following as of January 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 Trade accounts receivable $ 1,046 &#160; $ 780 &#160; Less: Allowance for credit losses ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Product returns reserve ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Partner programs and other obligations ( 79 ) ( 58 ) Accounts receivable, net $ 961 &#160; $ 716 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAllowances for uncollectible trade receivables and contract assets are subject to impairment using the expected credit loss model. Allowances for expected credit losses are measured based upon the lifetime expected credit loss which is based on historical experience, the number of days that billings are past due, reasonable economic forecast, including revised forecast data for the current economic environment, customer payment behavior, credit reports, and other customer-specific information. Allowances for credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets were not material as of January 31, 2023. \n\nAs part of the indirect channel model, Autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period. The majority of these incentives are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription or maintenance revenue over the contract period. The remainder reduces subscription or maintenance revenue in the current period. \n\nThese incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments. Depending on how the payments are made, the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are recognized on the balance sheet as either a reduction to accounts receivable or recorded as accounts payable. \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \n\nAutodesk places its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with, and in the custody of, multiple diversified financial institutions globally with high credit ratings and limits the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security, and issuer. Autodesk&#8217;s primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup Inc. and its global affiliates. Citibank, N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and an agent in the syndicate of Autodesk&#8217;s $ 1.5 billion revolving credit facility. \n\nThe bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose Autodesk to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Autodesk only contracts with counterparties who meet the Company's minimum requirements under its counterparty risk assessment process. Autodesk monitors counterparty risk on at least a quarterly basis and will adjust its exposure to various counterparties as necessary. Autodesk generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, Autodesk does not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. \n\nAutodesk&#8217;s accounts receivable are derived from sales to a large number of resellers, distributors, and direct customers in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC geographies. Autodesk performs ongoing evaluations of these partners&#8217; and customers&#8217; financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally does not require collateral from such parties. Total sales to the Company&#8217;s largest distributor Tech Data Corporation, and its global affiliates (&#8220;Tech Data&#8221;), accounted for 37 %, 36 %, and 37 % of Autodesk's net revenue for fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of the net revenue from sales to Tech Data is for sales made outside of the United States. In addition, Tech Data accounted for 27 % and 24 % of trade accounts receivable as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Ingram Micro Inc. (&#8220;Ingram Micro&#8221;), our second largest distributor, accounted for 9 %, 9 %, and 10 % of Autodesk&#8217;s total net revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of Autodesk&#8217;s total net revenue or trade accounts receivable for each of the respective periods. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIntangible Assets, Net \n\nIntangible assets include customer relationships, developed technologies, trade names and patents, and other, and the related accumulated amortization. These assets are presented as &#8220;Intangible assets, net&#8221; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The majority of Autodesk&#8217;s intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated economic life, which ranges from 3 to 15 years. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $ 98 million in fiscal 2023, $ 94 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 70 million in fiscal 2021. \n\nIntangible assets and related accumulated amortization at January 31, 2023 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Gross Carrying Amount (1) Accumulated Amortization Net Customer relationships $ 659 &#160; $ ( 402 ) $ 257 &#160; Developed technologies 858 &#160; ( 718 ) 140 &#160; Trade names and patents 116 &#160; ( 106 ) 10 &#160; Total intangible assets $ 1,633 &#160; $ ( 1,226 ) $ 407 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________ \n\n(1) Includes the effects of foreign currency translation. \n\nIntangible assets and related accumulated amortization at January 31, 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Gross Carrying Amount (1) Accumulated Amortization Net Customer relationships $ 667 &#160; $ ( 375 ) $ 292 &#160; Developed technologies 847 &#160; ( 661 ) 186 &#160; Trade names and patents 116 &#160; ( 100 ) 16 &#160; Total intangible assets $ 1,630 &#160; $ ( 1,136 ) $ 494 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________ \n\n(1) Includes the effects of foreign currency translation. \n\nThe weighted average amortization period for intangible assets during fiscal 2023 was 9.3 years. Expected future amortization expense for intangible assets for each of the fiscal years ended thereafter is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2024 $ 80 &#160; 2025 70 &#160; 2026 63 &#160; 2027 53 &#160; 2028 20 &#160; Thereafter 121 &#160; Total $ 407 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nComputer Equipment, Software, Furniture, and Leasehold Improvements, Net \n\nComputer equipment, software, and furniture are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years . Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Depreciation expense was $ 50 million in fiscal 2023, $ 52 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 51 million in fiscal 2021. Autodesk recognized impairment losses of $ 29 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. Impairment losses were no t material in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nComputer equipment, software, furniture, leasehold improvements, and the related accumulated depreciation at January 31 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 Computer hardware, at cost $ 126 &#160; $ 137 &#160; Computer software, at cost 49 &#160; 55 &#160; Leasehold improvements, land and buildings, at cost 363 &#160; 351 &#160; Furniture and equipment, at cost 94 &#160; 93 &#160; Computer software, hardware, leasehold improvements, furniture, and equipment, at cost 632 &#160; 636 &#160; Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 488 ) ( 474 ) Computer software, hardware, leasehold improvements, furniture, and equipment, net \n\n$ 144 &#160; $ 162 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCosts incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities. These capitalized costs are amortized straight-line over the software&#8217;s expected useful life, which is generally three years . \n\nSoftware Development Costs \n\nSoftware development costs for external use incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development expenses. Autodesk defines establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general market availability of the products are capitalized and generally amortized over a two-year period, if material. Autodesk had no material capitalized software development costs at January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022. \n\nCloud Computing Arrangements \n\nAutodesk enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts. Costs incurred for these arrangements are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities. Autodesk amortizes the capitalized development costs straight-line over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. The capitalized costs are included in &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized costs were $ 190 million and $ 128 million at January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $ 41 million and $ 17 million at January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, respectively. Amortization expense was $ 24 million, $ 12 million, and $ 4 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively. \n\nLeases \n\nAutodesk determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in &#8220;Operating lease right-of-use assets,&#8221; &#8220;Operating lease liabilities,&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term operating lease liabilities&#8221; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets represent Autodesk&#8217;s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company&#8217;s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and are reduced by any lease incentives. Autodesk uses its incremental borrowing rate, if the Company&#8217;s leases do not provide an implicit rate, adjusted for local country-specific borrowing rates as applicable, based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Options to extend or terminate the lease are considered in determining the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nAutodesk has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Autodesk accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\nAutodesk records the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the date of the respective acquisition, with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with Autodesk&#8217;s &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221; policy in Note 1 &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. Autodesk recorded the excess of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, Autodesk may record adjustments to these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nAt least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses the recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate generally using Level 3 inputs. If the long-lived assets are impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk recorded impairment charges on lease related right-of-use assets related to certain office leases during both the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 9, &#8220;Leases&#8221; for further discussion. Impairment charges in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 were not material. \n\nIn addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill consists of the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Autodesk tests goodwill for impairment annually in its fourth fiscal quarter or more often if circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist, or if events have affected the composition of reporting units. \n\nWhen goodwill is assessed for impairment, Autodesk has the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (&#8220;optional assessment&#8221;) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity-specific factors; and industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. \n\nThe quantitative impairment test is necessary when either Autodesk does not use the optional assessment or, as a result of the optional assessment, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. In situations in which an entity&#8217;s reporting unit is publicly traded, the fair value of the company may be approximated by its market capitalization, in performing the quantitative impairment test. \n\nGoodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in the Company&#8217;s statements of operations. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. The value of Autodesk&#8217;s goodwill could also be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) declines in Autodesk&#8217;s actual financial results, (ii) a sustained decline in Autodesk&#8217;s market capitalization, (iii) a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the industries Autodesk serves, or (iv) changes in Autodesk&#8217;s business strategy. \n\nFor the annual impairment test, Autodesk&#8217;s market capitalization was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the Company as of January 31, 2023. Accordingly, Autodesk has determined there was no goodwill impairment of our reporting unit during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. In addition, Autodesk did no t recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2022 or 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 Goodwill, beginning of the year $ 3,753 &#160; $ 2,856 &#160; Less: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year ( 149 ) ( 149 ) Additions arising from acquisitions during the year 85 &#160; 936 &#160; Effect of foreign currency translation, measurement period adjustments, and other (1) ( 64 ) ( 39 ) Goodwill, end of the year $ 3,625 &#160; $ 3,604 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________ \n\n(1) Measurement period adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company's preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets and liabilities assumed. \n\nDeferred Tax Assets \n\nDeferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against Netherlands, Australia, California, Michigan and U.S. capital loss deferred tax assets. Autodesk performs a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. \n\nStock-based Compensation Expense \n\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue $ 34 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 17 &#160; Cost of other revenue 12 &#160; 10 &#160; 6 &#160; Marketing and sales 263 &#160; 234 &#160; 178 &#160; Research and development 266 &#160; 220 &#160; 145 &#160; General and administrative 85 &#160; 70 &#160; 53 &#160; Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") purchases \n\n660 &#160; 559 &#160; 399 &#160; Tax expense (benefit) 13 &#160; ( 53 ) ( 42 ) Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases, net \n\n$ 673 &#160; $ 506 &#160; $ 357 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nAutodesk measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award, and recognizes expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Autodesk determines the estimated fair value of stock-based payment awards for stock options and grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#8220;BSM&#8221;) option-pricing model. To determine the grant-date fair value of our stock-based payment awards for restricted stock units and performance stock units, we use the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case we use the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award, and expected dividends. The variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Autodesk uses the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards: \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended &#160; January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 January 31, 2021 &#160; Performance Stock Unit ESPP Performance Stock Unit ESPP Performance Stock Unit ESPP Range of expected volatilities \n\n39.4 - 40.7 % \n\n38.3 - 44.9 % \n\n36.9 % \n\n29.5 - 41.8 % \n\n50.7 % \n\n39.4 - 45.8 % \n\nRange of expected lives (in years) \n\nN/A \n\n0.5 - 2.0 \n\nN/A \n\n0.5 - 2.0 \n\nN/A \n\n0.5 - 2.0 \n\nExpected dividends &#8212; % \n\n&#8212; % \n\n&#8212; % \n\n&#8212; % \n\n&#8212; % \n\n&#8212; % \n\nRange of risk-free interest rates \n\n1.2 - 1.6 % \n\n0.9 - 3.9 % \n\n0.1 % \n\n0.1 - 0.2 % \n\n0.3 % \n\n0.1 - 0.5 % \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nAutodesk estimates expected volatility for stock-based awards based on the average of the following two measures: (1) a measure of historical volatility in the trading market for the Company&#8217;s common stock, and (2) the implied volatility of traded options to purchase shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of companies within the S&#38;P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $ 2.0 billion, depending on the award type. \n\nAutodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination behavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four six-month exercise periods within a 24 -month offering period. \n\nAutodesk did no t pay cash dividends in fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model. \n\nThe risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based awards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives. \n\nAutodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest. Autodesk accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards as those forfeitures occur. \n\nAdvertising Expenses \n\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses incurred were $ 69 million in fiscal 2023, $ 80 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 60 million in fiscal 2021. \n\nNet Income Per Share \n\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period and potentially dilutive common shares, including the effect of restricted stock units, performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \n\nThe funded status of Autodesk&#8217;s defined benefit pension plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for the fiscal years presented. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on employee services already rendered and estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of Autodesk&#8217;s cumulative company and participant contributions made to the various plans in effect. \n\nNet periodic benefit cost is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and includes service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs, and gains or losses previously recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Certain events, such as changes in the employee base, plan amendments, and changes in \n\nTable of Contents \n\nactuarial assumptions may result in a change in the defined benefit obligation and the corresponding change to other comprehensive loss. \n\nGains and losses and prior service costs not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as they arise are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Those gains and losses and prior service costs are subsequently amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service lives of the plan participants using a corridor approach to determine the portion of gain or loss subject to amortization. \n\nThe measurement of projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions that reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age and years of services, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return of plan assets, rate of compensation increases, interest rates, and mortality rates. \n\nAccounting Standards in Fiscal 2023 \n\nWith the exception of those discussed below, there have been no recent changes in accounting pronouncements issued by FASB or adopted by the Company during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, that are applicable to the Company. \n\nAccounting Standards Adopted \n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2020-04, &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting&#8221; (&#8220;ASU No. 2020-04&#8221;), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, &#8220;Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848&#8221; which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. Autodesk applied the expedients in ASU No. 2020-04 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-04 did not have a material impact on Autodesk&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. \n\nRecently issued accounting standards not yet adopted \n\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2022-03&#8221;), which applies to all equity securities measured at fair value that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. ASU 2022-03 prohibits entities from taking into account contractual restrictions on the sale of equity securities when estimating fair value and introduces required disclosures for such transactions. ASU 2022-03 is effective for Autodesk's fiscal year beginning February 1, 2024 and interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. Autodesk does not believe ASU No. 2022-03 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\n2. Revenue Recognition \n\nRevenue Disaggregation \n\nAutodesk recognizes revenue from the sale of (1) product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and enterprise business agreements (&#8220;EBAs&#8221;), (2) renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license, and (3) consulting, training, and other products and services. The three categories are presented as line items on Autodesk&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nInformation regarding the components of Autodesk&#8217;s net revenue from contracts with customers by product family, geographic location, sales channel, and product type was as follows: &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Net revenue by product family: Architecture, Engineering and Construction (1) $ 2,278 &#160; $ 1,969 &#160; $ 1,649 &#160; AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT (1) 1,387 &#160; 1,244 &#160; 1,099 &#160; Manufacturing 978 &#160; 876 &#160; 799 &#160; Media and Entertainment 291 &#160; 259 &#160; 219 &#160; Other 71 &#160; 38 &#160; 24 &#160; Total net revenue $ 5,005 &#160; $ 4,386 &#160; $ 3,790 &#160; Net revenue by geographic area: Americas U.S. $ 1,720 &#160; $ 1,457 &#160; $ 1,282 &#160; Other Americas 372 &#160; 308 &#160; 260 &#160; Total Americas 2,092 &#160; 1,765 &#160; 1,542 &#160; Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,906 &#160; 1,700 &#160; 1,473 &#160; Asia Pacific 1,007 &#160; 921 &#160; 775 &#160; Total net revenue $ 5,005 &#160; $ 4,386 &#160; $ 3,790 &#160; Net revenue by sales channel: Indirect $ 3,250 &#160; $ 2,849 &#160; $ 2,600 &#160; Direct 1,755 &#160; 1,537 &#160; 1,190 &#160; Total net revenue $ 5,005 &#160; $ 4,386 &#160; $ 3,790 &#160; Net revenue by product type (2): Design $ 4,264 &#160; $ 3,772 &#160; $ 3,268 &#160; Make 452 &#160; 364 &#160; 296 &#160; Other 289 &#160; 250 &#160; 226 &#160; Total net revenue $ 5,005 &#160; $ 4,386 &#160; $ 3,790 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(1) During the year ended January 31, 2023, the Company corrected an immaterial classification error and reclassified certain revenue amounts between Architecture, Engineering and Construction and AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. The year ended January 31, 2022 has been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not impact total net revenue. \n\n(2) The prior period amount has been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation for a change in presentation of certain subscription plan offerings. See Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for further detail. \n\nPayments for product subscriptions, industry collections, cloud subscriptions, and maintenance subscriptions are typically due up front with payment terms of 30 to 45 days. Payments on EBAs are typically due in annual installments over the contract term, with payment terms of 30 to 60 days. Autodesk does not have any material variable consideration, such as obligations for returns, refunds, warranties, or amounts payable to customers for which significant estimation or judgment is required as of the reporting date. \n\nRemaining performance obligations consist of total short-term, long-term, and unbilled deferred revenue. As of January 31, 2023, Autodesk had remaining performance obligations of $ 5.62 billion, which represents the total contract price allocated to remaining performance obligations, which are generally recognized over the next three years . We expect to recognize $ 3.52 billion or 63 % of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the next 12 months. We expect to recognize the remaining $ 2.10 billion or 37 % of our remaining performance obligations as revenue thereafter. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe amount of remaining performance obligations may be impacted by the specific timing, duration, and size of customer subscription and support agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, the frequency of the billing installments, and foreign currency fluctuations. \n\nContract Balances \n\nWe receive payments from customers based on a billing schedule as established in our contracts. Contract assets relate to performance completed in advance of scheduled billings. Contract assets were not material as of January 31, 2023. Deferred revenue relates to billings in advance of performance under the contract. The primary changes in our contract assets and deferred revenues are due to our performance under the contracts and billings. \n\nRevenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, that was included in the deferred revenue balances at January 31, 2022 and 2021, was $ 2.85 billion and $ 2.50 billion, respectively. The satisfaction of performance obligations typically lags behind billings received under revenue contracts from customers. \n\n&#160; \n\n3.

Total unrealized gains for securities with net gains in accumulated other comprehensive income were not material for fiscal 2023. \n\nAutodesk monitors all marketable debt securities for potential credit losses by reviewing indicators such as, but not limited to, current credit rating, change in credit rating, credit outlook, and default risk. There were no allowances for credit losses as of both January 31, 2023 and 2022. There were no write offs of accrued interest receivables for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. \n\nThere were no material realized gain or loss for the sales or redemptions of debt securities during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. Realized gains and losses from the sale or redemption of marketable securities are recorded in &#8220;Interest and other expense, net&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nProceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable debt securities for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $ 450 million, $ 38 million, and $ 17 million, respectively. \n\nStrategic investments in equity securities \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, Autodesk had $ 177 million and $ 134 million, respectively, in direct investments in privately held companies. These strategic investments in equity securities do not have readily determined fair values and Autodesk uses the measurement alternative to account for the adjustment to these investments in a given quarter. If Autodesk determines that an impairment has occurred, Autodesk writes down the investment to its fair value. These strategic investments in equity securities are generally subject to a security-specific restriction which limits the sale or transfer of the respective equity security during the holding period. \n\nAdjustments to the carrying value of our strategic investments in equity securities with no readily determined fair values measured using the measurement alternative are included in Interest and Other Expense, net on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. These adjustments were as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended Cumulative Amount as of 2023 2022 2021 January 31, 2023 Upward adjustments $ 6 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 29 &#160; Negative adjustments, including impairments ( 9 ) ( 17 ) ( 52 ) ( 86 ) Net adjustments $ ( 3 ) $ ( 10 ) $ ( 45 ) $ ( 57 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nAutodesk does not consider the remaining investments to be impaired as of January 31, 2023. \n\nDuring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Autodesk recognized gains of $ 2 million and $ 8 million, respectively, on the disposition of strategic investments in equity securities. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, Autodesk recognized no gain on the disposition of strategic investments in equity securities. \n\nFair Value \n\nAutodesk applies fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities, which consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and other financial instruments, on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. \n\nThe following tables summarize the Company's financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis by significant investment category as of January 31, 2023 and 2022: \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START January 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Cash equivalents (1): Money market funds $ 737 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 737 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 169 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 169 &#160; Certificates of deposit &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; U.S. government securities &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; Other (2) 4 &#160; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 12 &#160; Marketable securities: Short-term Corporate debt securities &#8212; &#160; 44 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 44 &#160; Commercial paper &#8212; &#160; 42 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 42 &#160; Asset backed securities &#8212; &#160; 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 19 &#160; U.S. government securities &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; Other (3) &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Long-term Corporate debt securities &#8212; &#160; 45 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 45 &#160; U.S. government securities &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; Asset backed securities &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 13 &#160; Other (4) &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 9 &#160; Long-term other assets: Mutual funds (5) (6) 86 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 86 &#160; Convertible debt securities (6) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Derivative assets: Derivative contract assets (6) &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; Derivative liabilities: Derivative contract liabilities (7) &#8212; &#160; ( 31 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 31 ) Total $ 827 &#160; $ 435 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 1,264 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(1) Included in &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents&#8221; in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Equity Compensation \n\nStock Plans \n\nThe 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2022 Plan&#8221;) was approved by Autodesk&#8217;s stockholders and became effective on June 16, 2022. The 2022 Plan replaced the 2012 Employee Stock Plan, as amended, and the 2012 Outside Directors&#8217; Stock Plan, as amended (collectively, the &#8220;Prior Plans&#8221;), and no further equity awards may be granted under the Prior Plans. The 2022 Plan reserves up to 23 million shares. The 2022 Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Each restricted stock unit or restricted stock award granted will be counted against the shares authorized for issuance under the 2022 Plan as 2.08 shares. If a granted option, restricted stock unit, or restricted stock award expires or becomes unexercisable for any reason, the unpurchased or forfeited shares that were granted may be returned to the 2022 Plan and may become available for future grant under the 2022 Plan. As of January 31, 2023, 2 million shares subject to restricted stock units and restricted stock awards have been granted under the 2022 Plan. Restricted stock units that were granted under the 2022 Plan vest over one to three years from the date of grant. The 2022 Plan will expire on March 17, 2032. At January 31, 2023, approximately 21 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2022 Plan. \n\nPursuant to the BuildingConnected acquisition on January 23, 2019, the Company assumed the unvested options under the BuildingConnected, Inc. 2013 Stock Plan (&#8220;BuildingConnected 2013 Plan&#8221;). No further equity awards will be granted under the BuildingConnected 2013 Plan. As of January 31, 2023, approximately 4 thousand shares subject to options remain outstanding under the BuildingConnected 2013 Plan. Options that were granted under the BuildingConnected 2013 Plan vest over a four-year period and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The BuildingConnected 2013 Plan will expire on May 6, 2023. \n\nThe following sections summarize activity under Autodesk&#8217;s stock plans. \n\nRestricted Stock Units: \n\nA summary of restricted stock activity for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Unreleased Restricted Stock Units (in thousands) Weighted average grant date fair value per share \n\nUnvested restricted stock at January 31, 2022 \n\n4,033 &#160; $ 251.17 &#160; Granted 3,742 &#160; 198.89 &#160; Vested ( 2,388 ) 244.14 &#160; Canceled/Forfeited ( 537 ) 231.88 &#160; Performance Adjustment (1) \n\n( 2 ) 299.07 &#160; \n\nUnvested restricted stock at January 31, 2023 \n\n4,848 &#160; $ 216.20 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n_______________ \n\n(1) Based on Autodesk&#8217;s financial results and relative total stockholder return for the fiscal 2022 performance period. The performance stock units were attained at rates ranging from 87 % to 113 % of the target award. \n\nFor the restricted stock granted during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the weighted average grant date fair values were $ 198.89 , $ 288.13 , and $ 224.20 , respectively. The fair value of the shares vested during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $ 490 million, $ 620 million, and $ 503 million, respectively. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk granted 3 million restricted stock units. Restricted stock units vest over periods ranging from immediately upon grant to a pre-determined date that is typically within three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. The fair value of the restricted stock units is expensed ratably over the vesting period. \n\nDuring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Autodesk settled liability-classified awards of $ 11 million and $ 3 million, respectively. As these awards were settled in a fixed dollar amount of shares, the awards were accounted for as a liability-classified award and were expensed using the straight-line method over the vesting period. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAutodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units of $ 510 million, $ 425 million, and $ 309 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $ 722 million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.85 years. At January 31, 2023, the number of restricted stock units granted but unvested was 4 million. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk granted 239 thousand performance stock units for which the ultimate number of shares earned is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of the stated service and performance period. The performance criteria for the performance stock units are primarily based on revenue and free cash flow goals adopted by the Compensation and Human Resource Committee and total stockholder return compared against companies in the S&#38;P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $ 2.0 billion (&#8220;Relative TSR&#8221;). The fair value of the performance stock units is expensed using the accelerated attribution method over the three-year vesting period and have the following vesting schedule: \n\n&#8226; Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year one, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for fiscal 2023 as well as one-year Relative TSR (covering year one). \n\n&#8226; Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year two, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for year two as well as two-year Relative TSR (covering years one and two). \n\n&#8226; Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year three, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for year three as well as three-year Relative TSR (covering years one, two and three). \n\nThe performance criteria for the performance stock units vested during fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, was based on revenue and free cash flow goals adopted by the Compensation and Human Resource Committee. \n\nAdditionally, during fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk granted 115 thousand performance stock units, as part of a program offering certain employees the option to receive equity in lieu of the opportunity to receive an annual cash incentive award. The ultimate number of shares earned is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of the stated service and performance period. The performance criteria for the performance stock units are based on revenue and Non-GAAP income from operations targets adopted by the Compensation and Human Resource Committee. The fair value of these performance stock units is expensed using the accelerated attribution method over the one-year vesting period. \n\nPerformance stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. The fair value of the performance stock units is expensed using the accelerated attribution over the vesting period. \n\nAutodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to performance stock units of $ 54 million, $ 68 million, and $ 31 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $ 8 million related to unvested performance stock units, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.71 years. At January 31, 2023, the number of performance stock units granted but unvested was 461 thousand. \n\nOn May 20, 2022, the Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the Board of Directors approved an immaterial modification to certain elements of the fiscal year 2023 performance criteria for the performance stock units granted in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021. Autodesk accounted for the change as a modification and revalued the awards as of the modification date resulting in no material incremental stock-based compensation expense. \n\nCommon Stock \n\nAutodesk agreed to issue a fixed amount of $ 5 million in common stock at a future date to certain employees in connection with a fiscal 2021 acquisition. Issuance of the common stock is dependent on the respective employees&#8217; continued employment through the vesting period. During fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, Autodesk issued 8 thousand shares at an aggregate fair value of $ 3 million. During fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk issued the remaining 13 thousand shares at an aggregate fair value of $ 3 million.

The number of shares to be issued will be determined based on the VWAP of Autodesk&#8217;s common stock at the issuance date. During fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk issued 18 thousand shares at an aggregate fair value of $ 3 million. As of January 31, 2023, the remaining shares to be issued are estimated to be 34 thousand. The awards are accounted for as liability-classified awards and are recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period. Additionally, Autodesk issued 13 thousand shares of restricted common stock to certain employees in connection with these fiscal 2022 acquisitions. These shares of restricted common stock were recorded as &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized to stock-based compensation expense for post-acquisition services using the straight-line method over the vesting period. See Note 6, &#8220;Acquisitions,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nAutodesk issued 40 thousand shares of restricted common stock to certain employees in connection with a fiscal 2023 acquisition. These shares of restricted common stock were recorded as &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized to stock-based compensation expense for post-acquisition services using the straight-line method over the two-year vesting period. Additionally, Autodesk agreed to issue a fixed amount of $ 5 million in common stock at a future date to certain employees in connection with a fiscal 2023 acquisition. Issuance of the common stock is dependent on the respective employees&#8217; continued employment through the vesting period. The number of shares to be issued will be determined based on the VWAP of Autodesk&#8217;s common stock at the issuance date. As of January 31, 2023, shares to be issued are estimated to be 23 thousand. The awards are accounted for as liability-classified awards and are recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period. See Note 6, &#8220;Acquisitions,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nAutodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to common stock shares of $ 32 million, $ 17 million, and $ 2 million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\n1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;) \n\nUnder Autodesk&#8217;s ESPP, which was approved by stockholders in 1998, eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesk&#8217;s common stock at their discretion using up to 15 % of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations, at 85 % of the lower of Autodesk's closing price (fair market value) on the offering date or the exercise date. The offering period for ESPP awards consists of four six-month exercise periods within a 24 -month offering period. \n\nAt January 31, 2023, a total of 5 million shares were available for future issuance. Under the ESPP, the Company issues shares on the first trading day following March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The ESPP does not have an expiration date. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nA summary of the ESPP activity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 2022 2021 Issued shares (in thousands) 740 &#160; 851 &#160; 890 &#160; Average price of issued shares $ 166.44 &#160; $ 130.13 &#160; $ 122.73 &#160; Weighted average grant date fair value of awards granted under the ESPP $ 67.77 &#160; $ 84.21 &#160; $ 55.98 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAutodesk recorded $ 62 million, $ 37 million, and $ 40 million of compensation expense associated with the ESPP in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk reset the price for certain offering dates in connection with Autodesk&#8217;s ESPP as Autodesk&#8217;s closing stock price for the respective offering dates was above the closing stock price on March 31, 2022 and on September 30, 2022, which triggered new 24 -month offering periods through March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively, resulting in aggregate modification expense of approximately $ 21 million to be recognized over the new offering periods. \n\nEquity Compensation Plan Information \n\nThe following table summarizes the number of outstanding options and awards granted to employees and directors, as well as the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under these plans as of January 31, 2023: \n\n##TABLE_START (a) (b) (c) Plan category Number of securities to be issued upon exercise or vesting of outstanding options and awards (in millions) Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a)) (in millions) (1) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 5 &#160; $ 21.03 &#160; 26 &#160; Total 5 &#160; $ 21.03 &#160; 26 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n____________________ \n\n(1) Included in this amount are 5 million securities available for future issuance under Autodesk&#8217;s ESPP. \n\n5.

In making that assessment, Autodesk evaluates whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available positive and negative evidence. \n\nIn evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, prior to fiscal 2021 Autodesk considered global cumulative losses arising from the Company&#8217;s business model transition as a significant piece of negative evidence. During fiscal 2021 Autodesk recognized cumulative earnings on a global basis and was profitable in the U.S. and forecasted future cumulative earnings in U.S. jurisdiction for future periods. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Autodesk released the valuation allowance against the Company&#8217;s U.S. deferred tax assets, due to positive evidence indicating that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. The Company has retained a valuation allowance against California and Michigan deferred tax assets and deferred tax assets that will convert into a capital loss upon reversal as we do not have sufficient income of the appropriate character to benefit these deferred tax assets. We released our Canada valuation allowance in fiscal 2023 due to positive evidence supporting the utilization of the R&#38;D credits before they expire, resulting in a $ 38 million non-cash benefit to earnings. The Company continues to retain a valuation allowance of $ 23 million against foreign deferred tax assets in the Netherlands and Australia as of January 31, 2023. \n\nThe valuation allowance decreased by $ 40 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to the release of the Canada valuation allowance of $ 38 million. The valuation allowance increased by $ 2.0 million in fiscal 2022, primarily due to the generation of deferred tax attributes and the establishment of a valuation allowance in Australia. The valuation allowance decreased by $ 697 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to the U.S. valuation allowance release of $ 679 million. \n\nThe company has elected to recognize any potential GILTI obligations as an expense in the period it is incurred. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, Autodesk had $ 14 million of cumulative U.S. federal tax loss carryforwards and $ 355 million of cumulative U.S. state tax loss carryforwards, which may be available to reduce future income tax liabilities in federal and state jurisdictions. The pre-fiscal 2019 U.S. federal tax loss carryforward will expire beginning fiscal 2035 through fiscal 2039. U.S. federal losses generated beginning in fiscal 2019 do not expire and are carried forward indefinitely. The U.S. state tax loss carryforward will expire beginning fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2043. \n\nIn addition to U.S. federal and state tax loss carryforwards, the Netherlands, Norway, and other foreign jurisdictions incurred tax losses totaling $ 100 million, which may be available to reduce future income tax liabilities. Our Norway losses, of $ 51 million, have an indefinite expiration period. The pre-fiscal 2023 Netherlands losses of $ 43 million will expire beginning in fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2028. Netherlands losses generated beginning in fiscal 2023 do not expire and are carried forward indefinitely. All Netherlands losses have a full valuation allowance against them on our balance sheet as the Company has determined it is more likely than not that these losses will not be utilized. \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, Autodesk had $ 115 million of cumulative California state research tax credit carryforwards, and $ 46 million of cumulative Canadian federal research, which may be available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the respective jurisdictions. The state research tax credit carryforwards may reduce future California income tax liabilities indefinitely, and the Canadian research tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning fiscal 2031 through fiscal 2043. Autodesk also has $ 1 million of cumulative U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforwards, which may be available to reduce future U.S. tax liabilities. These foreign tax credits will expire beginning fiscal 2027 through fiscal 2032. As discussed above, the California cumulative assets have full valuation allowance against them on our balance sheet as the Company has determined it is more likely than not that these losses and credits will not be utilized. \n\nUtilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. No ownership change has occurred through the balance sheet date that would result in permanent losses of the U.S. federal and state tax attributes. \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, the Company had $ 223 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $ 38 million would reduce our valuation allowance, if recognized. The remaining $ 185 million would impact the effective tax rate. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months for statute lapse of approximately $ 4 million. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the fiscal year $ 207 &#160; $ 198 &#160; $ 221 &#160; Increases for tax positions of prior years 8 &#160; 9 &#160; 13 &#160; Decreases for tax positions of prior years ( 3 ) ( 7 ) ( 41 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 17 &#160; 7 &#160; 6 &#160; Decreases relating to settlements with taxing authorities ( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Reductions as a result of lapse of the statute of limitations ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 1 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the fiscal year $ 223 &#160; $ 207 &#160; $ 198 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIt is the Company&#8217;s continuing practice to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Autodesk had $ 5 million, $ 7 million, and $ 5 million, net of tax benefit, accrued for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. There was $( 2 ) million, $ 2 million, and $ 2 million of net expense for interest and penalties related to tax matters recorded through the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nAutodesk&#8217;s U.S. and state income tax returns for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2023 remain open to examination due to either net operating loss or credit carryforward. The Internal Revenue Service notified the Company of examination of the Company&#8217;s consolidated federal income tax returns for fiscal 2020 and 2021. This audit commenced in February 2022. \n\nAutodesk files tax returns in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions with open tax years ranging from fiscal 2005 to 2023. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n6. Acquisitions \n\nFiscal 2023 Acquisitions \n\nThe results of operations for the following acquisitions are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations since their respective acquisition dates. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to Autodesk&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, Autodesk completed two business combinations. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $ 114 million, which consisted of $ 96 million of cash, 40 thousand shares of Autodesk&#8217;s restricted common stock at an aggregate fair value of $ 10 million, and Autodesk will issue a fixed amount of $ 5 million in common stock at future dates to certain employees. Of the total consideration transferred, $ 97 million is considered purchase consideration. Of the remaining amount, $ 10 million was recorded in &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized to stock-based compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period, $ 5 million was accounted for as liability-classified awards and will be recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period and $ 2 million was recorded as stock-based compensation expense on the date of acquisition. The 40 thousand shares of restricted common stock are subject to forfeiture until the second anniversary of the acquisition closing date. The shares are released on the first and second anniversaries, 40 % and 60 %, respectively, subject to continued employment. Issuance of the $ 5 million fixed value in common stock is dependent on the respective employees&#8217; continued employment and vests 40 % and 60 % on the first and second anniversaries of the closing date, respectively. The number of shares will be determined based on the VWAP of Autodesk&#8217;s common stock for the ninety consecutive trading day period ending on the release date. As of January 31, 2023, shares to be issued are estimated to be 23 thousand. See also Note 4, &#8220;Equity Compensation &#8221;. \n\nPurchase Price Allocation \n\nThe acquisitions during fiscal 2023 were accounted for as business combinations, and Autodesk recorded the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of each respective acquisition. The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. Autodesk recorded the excess of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. The goodwill recorded was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. No goodwill is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The transaction costs related to the acquisitions were not material. \n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class for the business combinations that were completed during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023: ##TABLE_START Aggregated Total Developed technologies $ 8 &#160; Customer relationships 4 &#160; Goodwill 85 &#160; Deferred revenue and long-term deferred revenue ( 2 ) Long-term deferred income taxes 1 &#160; Net tangible assets 1 &#160; Total $ 97 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFor the business combinations, the allocation of purchase price consideration to certain assets and liabilities as well as the final amount of purchase consideration are not yet finalized. For the items not yet finalized, Autodesk's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized are amounts for tax assets and liabilities and residual goodwill. \n\nFiscal 2022 Acquisitions \n\nUpchain \n\nOn May 11, 2021, Autodesk acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Upchain Inc. (&#8220;Upchain&#8221;), a cloud-based provider of product lifecycle management and product data management systems, for approximately $ 127 million in cash and Autodesk \n\nTable of Contents \n\nwill issue a fixed amount of $ 13 million in common stock at future dates to certain employees in connection with the acquisition for a total consideration of $ 140 million. Of the total consideration transferred, $ 124 million is considered purchase consideration. Of the remaining amount, $ 13 million is accounted for as liability-classified awards and recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period, and $ 3 million was recorded as stock-based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. Issuance of the $ 13 million fixed value in common stock is dependent on the respective employees&#8217; continued employment and vests 40 % and 60 % on the first and second anniversaries of the closing date, respectively. The number of shares will be determined based on the VWAP of Autodesk&#8217;s common stock for the ninety consecutive trading day period ending on the release date.

The ending balance of assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer was $ 133 million and $ 139 million as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. These assets are recorded in &#8220;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term other assets&#8221; in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amortization expense related to assets recognized from costs to obtain a contract with a customer was $ 138 million, $ 118 million, and $ 97 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Autodesk did no t recognize any contract cost impairment losses during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. \n\n8. Borrowing Arrangements \n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A. (&#8220;Citibank&#8221;), as administrative agent, which provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $ 1.5 billion, with an option to be increased up to $ 2.0 billion. The revolving credit facility is available for working capital or other business needs. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that could, among other things, restrict the imposition of liens on Autodesk&#8217;s assets, and restrict Autodesk&#8217;s ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if Autodesk fails to maintain compliance with the financial covenants. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of Consolidated Covenant Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) no greater than 3.50 :1.00 during the term of the credit facility, subject to adjustment following the consummation of certain acquisitions up to 4.00 :1.00 for up to four consecutive fiscal quarters. At January 31, 2023, Autodesk was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants. Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company&#8217;s option, at either (i) a per annum rate equal to the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of between 0.000 % and 0.375 %, depending on the Company&#8217;s Public Debt Rating (as defined in the Credit Agreement), or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, plus a margin of between 0.785 % and 1.375 %, depending on Company&#8217;s Public Debt Rating. The interest rates for the revolving credit facility are subject to upward or downward adjustments, on an annual basis, if the Company achieves, or fails to achieve, certain sustainability-linked targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: \n\nTable of Contents \n\n(i) the amount of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from the global operations of the Company and its subsidiaries during a fiscal year less qualified emissions reduction instruments and (ii) the percentage of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries identifying as female working in technical roles. The maturity date on the Credit Agreement is September 30, 2026. At January 31, 2023, Autodesk had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. \n\nIn October 2021, Autodesk issued $ 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.4 % notes due December 15, 2031 (&#8220;2021 Notes&#8221;). Net of a discount of $ 3 million and issuance costs of $ 9 million, Autodesk received net proceeds of $ 988 million from issuance of the 2021 Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2021 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2021 Notes were designated as sustainability bonds, the net proceeds of which are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following areas: eco-efficient products, production technologies, and processes, sustainable water and wastewater management, renewable energy &#38; energy efficiency, green buildings, pollution prevention and control, and socioeconomic advancement and empowerment. \n\nIn January 2020, Autodesk issued $ 500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.85 % notes due January 15, 2030 (&#8220;2020 Notes&#8221;). Net of a discount of $ 1 million and issuance costs of $ 5 million, Autodesk received net proceeds of $ 494 million from issuance of the 2020 Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The proceeds of the 2020 Notes were used for the repayment of $ 450 million 2015 Notes, as defined below, and the remainder is available for general corporate purposes. \n\nIn June 2017, Autodesk issued $ 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5 % notes due June 15, 2027 (the &#8220;2017 Notes&#8221;). Net of a discount of $ 3 million and issuance costs of $ 5 million, Autodesk received net proceeds of $ 492 million from issuance of the 2017 Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2017 Notes using the effective interest method. The proceeds of the 2017 Notes have been used for the repayment of $ 400 million of debt due December 15, 2017, and the remainder is available for general corporate purposes. \n\nIn June 2015, Autodesk issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375 % notes due June 15, 2025 (&#8220; 2015 Notes&#8221;). Net of a discount of $ 1 million, and issuance costs of $ 3 million, Autodesk received net proceeds of $ 296 million from issuance of the 2015 Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2015 Notes using the effective interest method. The proceeds of the 2015 Notes are available for general corporate purposes. \n\nIn December 2012, Autodesk issued $ 350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.6 % notes due December 15, 2022 (&#8220;2012 Notes&#8221;). Autodesk received net proceeds of $ 347 million from issuance of the 2012 Notes, net of an aggregate total discount and issuance costs of $ 3 million. Both the discount and issuance costs were being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2012 Notes using the effective interest method. On December 15, 2022, Autodesk repaid the $ 350 million 2012 Notes. Autodesk paid a redemption price of $ 350 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the date of redemption. \n\nThe 2021 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2017 Notes, and the 2015 Notes may all be redeemed at any time, subject to a make whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, Autodesk may be required to repurchase all the Notes, at a price equal to 101 % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. All Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit Autodesk&#8217;s ability to create certain liens, to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and to consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of its assets, subject to important qualifications and exceptions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBased on the quoted market prices, the approximate fair value of the notes as of January 31, 2023, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Aggregate Principal Amount Fair value 2015 Notes $ 300 &#160; $ 298 &#160; 2017 Notes 500 &#160; 484 &#160; 2020 Notes 500 &#160; 443 &#160; 2021 Notes 1,000 &#160; 836 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe expected future principal payments for all borrowings as of January 31, 2023, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal year ending 2024 $ &#8212; &#160; 2025 &#8212; &#160; 2026 300 &#160; 2027 &#8212; &#160; 2028 500 &#160; Thereafter 1,500 &#160; Total principal outstanding $ 2,300 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n9. Leases \n\nAutodesk has operating leases for real estate, vehicles and certain equipment. Leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 67 years, some of which include options to extend the lease with renewal terms from 1 year to 10 years and some of which include options to terminate the leases from less than 1 year to 7 years. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease liability if they are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to terminate are considered in determining the lease liability if they are reasonably certain of being exercised. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed, however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments for common area maintenance that are subject to annual reconciliation, and payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company&#8217;s leases do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Short-term leases are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term lease expense was not material for the periods presented. Changes in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are presented net in the &#8220;accounts payable and other liabilities&#8221; line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows with the exception of &#8220;Lease-related asset impairments&#8221; which is presented in &#8220;Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities&#8221;. \n\nDuring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, Autodesk recorded total operating lease right-of-use assets impairment charges of $ 29 million and $ 75 million, respectively. Autodesk did no t recognize any charges during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. Autodesk assessed the asset groupings for disaggregation based on the proposed changes in use of the facilities. For asset groups where impairment was triggered, Autodesk utilized an income approach to value the asset groups by developing discounted cash flow models. The significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models for each of the asset groups included projected sublease income over the remaining lease terms, expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, expected lease incentives offered to future tenants, and discount rates that reflected the level of risk associated with these future cash flows. These significant assumptions are considered Level 1 and Level 2 inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; The operating lease right-of-use assets and other lease-related assets charges are included in &#8220;general and administrative&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe components of lease cost were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue Cost of other revenue Marketing and sales Research and development General and administrative Total Operating lease cost $ 8 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 85 &#160; Variable lease cost 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 2 &#160; 14 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue Cost of other revenue Marketing and sales Research and development General and administrative Total Operating lease cost $ 8 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 43 &#160; $ 30 &#160; $ 15 &#160; $ 98 &#160; Variable lease cost 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 4 &#160; 2 &#160; 12 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue Cost of other revenue Marketing and sales Research and development General and administrative Total Operating lease cost $ 7 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 45 &#160; $ 29 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 101 &#160; Variable lease cost 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 4 &#160; 2 &#160; 12 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nSupplemental operating cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 Cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows (1) $ 115 &#160; $ 107 &#160; $ 96 &#160; Non-cash operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining operating right-of-use assets 48 &#160; 53 &#160; 67 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;_______________ \n\n(1) Includes $ 14 million, $ 12 million, and $ 12 million in variable lease payments not included in &#8220;Operating lease liabilities&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term operating lease liabilities&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases is 6.5 years and 6.9 years at January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average discount rate was 2.60 % and 2.46 % at January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal year ending 2024 $ 94 &#160; 2025 78 &#160; 2026 64 &#160; 2027 43 &#160; 2028 34 &#160; Thereafter 104 &#160; 417 &#160; Less imputed interest 32 &#160; Present value of operating lease liabilities $ 385 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAutodesk has subleased certain office space to a third party and has classified the sublease as an operating lease. The sublease has a remaining lease term of 9.1 years. Sublease income was $ 5 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. There was no sublease income recognized during fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sublease income is recorded as a reduction of lease expense in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n\nOperating lease amounts in the table above do not include sublease income payments of $ 86 million. Autodesk expects to receive sublease income payments of approximately $ 47 million for fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2028 and $ 39 million thereafter. \n\nAs of January 31, 2023, Autodesk had no additional operating lease minimum lease payments for executed leases that have not yet commenced. \n\n10.

These currency collars and forward contracts are designated and documented as cash flow hedges. The notional amounts of these contracts are presented net settled and were $ 934 million at January 31, 2023, and $ 1.08 billion at January 31, 2022. Outstanding contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The majority of the net gain of $ 64 million remaining in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive loss&#8221; as of January 31, 2023, is expected to be recognized into earnings within the next 24 months. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe location and amount of gain or loss recognized in income on cash flow hedges together with the total amount of income or expense presented in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations where the effects of the hedge are recorded were as follows for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Net revenue Cost of revenue Operating expenses \n\nSubscription revenue Maintenance revenue Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue Marketing and sales Research and development General and administrative Total amounts of income and expense line items presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations $ 4,651 $ 65 $ 343 $ 1,745 $ 1,219 $ 532 (Loss) gain on cash flow hedging relationships in Subtopic ASC 815-20 Foreign exchange contracts \n\nAmount of (loss) gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income $ 60 $ &#8212; $ ( 3 ) $ ( 10 ) $ ( 5 ) $ ( 6 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Net revenue Cost of revenue Operating expenses \n\nSubscription revenue (1) Maintenance revenue Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue Marketing and sales Research and development General and administrative Total amounts of income and expense line items presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations $ 4,060 $ 76 $ 299 $ 1,623 $ 1,115 $ 572 (Loss) gain on cash flow hedging relationships in Subtopic ASC 815-20 Foreign exchange contracts \n\nAmount of (loss) gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income $ ( 11 ) $ ( 1 ) $ &#8212; $ ( 3 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 1 ) ##TABLE_END ____________________ \n\n(1) In the current fiscal year, the Company changed its presentation of certain subscription plan offerings in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in all material respects. See Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; for further detail. \n\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments \n\nAutodesk uses foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, and cash. The notional amounts of these foreign currency contracts are presented net settled and were $ 951 million at January 31, 2023, and $ 542 million at January 31, 2022. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n11. Commitments and Contingencies \n\nPurchase Commitments \n\nIn the normal course of business, Autodesk enters into various purchase commitments for goods or services. Total non-cancellable purchase commitments as of January 31, 2023, were approximately $ 287 million for periods through fiscal 2033. These purchase commitments primarily result from contracts entered into for the acquisition of cloud services, commitments related to our investment agreements with limited liability partnership funds, and marketing. \n\nAutodesk has certain royalty commitments associated with the sale and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a fixed rate over a specified period, dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under cost of subscription and maintenance revenue and cost of other revenue on Autodesk&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $ 18 million in fiscal 2023, $ 16 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 15 million in fiscal 2021. \n\nGuarantees and Indemnifications \n\nIn the normal course of business, Autodesk provides indemnifications of varying scopes, including limited product warranties and indemnification of customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products or services. Autodesk accrues for known indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Historically, costs related to these indemnifications have not been significant, and because potential future costs are highly variable, Autodesk is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnifications on its future results of operations. \n\nIn connection with the purchase, sale, or license of assets or businesses with third parties, Autodesk has entered into or assumed customary indemnification agreements related to the assets or businesses purchased, sold, or licensed. Historically, costs related to these indemnifications have not been significant, and because potential future costs are highly variable, Autodesk is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnifications on its future results of operations. \n\nAs permitted under Delaware law, Autodesk has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at Autodesk&#8217;s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments Autodesk could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, Autodesk has directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce its financial exposure and may enable Autodesk to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Autodesk believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nAutodesk is involved in a variety of claims, suits, inquiries, investigations, and proceedings in the normal course of business including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, commercial, employment, tax, prosecution of unauthorized use, business practices, and other matters. Autodesk routinely reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, Autodesk records a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, Autodesk bases its loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, Autodesk reassesses its potential liability and may revise its estimates. In the Company&#8217;s opinion, resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or its financial position. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, there is a reasonable possibility that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows, or financial position in a particular period, however, based on the information known by the Company as of the date of this filing and the rules and regulations applicable to the preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements, any such amount is either immaterial or it is not possible to provide an estimated amount of any such potential loss. \n\n12. Stock Repurchase Program \n\nAutodesk has stock repurchase programs that are used to offset dilution from the issuance of stock under the Company&#8217;s employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of Autodesk and its stockholders, which has the effect of returning excess cash generated from the Company&#8217;s business to stockholders. Autodesk repurchased and retired \n\nTable of Contents \n\napproximately 5 million shares in fiscal 2023 at an average repurchase price of $ 198.51 per share, 4 million shares in fiscal 2022 at an average repurchase price of $ 275.50 per share, and 2 million shares in fiscal 2021 at an average repurchase price of $ 207.61 per share. \n\nIn November 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $ 5 billion of the Company's common stock, in addition to the shares remaining under previously announced share repurchase programs. \n\nAt January 31, 2023, 3 million shares and $ 5 billion remained available for repurchase under the September 2016 and November 2022 repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors, respectively . The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, cash requirements to retire outstanding debt, economic and market conditions, stock price, and legal and regulatory requirements. \n\n13. Interest and Other Expense, net \n\nInterest and other expense, net, consists of the following: ##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Interest and investment expense, net $ ( 71 ) $ ( 65 ) $ ( 51 ) Gain on foreign currency 15 &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; Gain (loss) on strategic investments 1 &#160; 3 &#160; ( 41 ) Other income 12 &#160; 8 &#160; 7 &#160; Interest and other expense, net $ ( 43 ) $ ( 53 ) $ ( 82 ) ##TABLE_END \n\n14.

Reclassifications of the defined benefit pension components of net periodic benefit cost are included in &#8220;Interest and other expense, net.&#8221; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n15. Net Income Per Share \n\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and potentially dilutive common shares, including the effect of restricted stock units, performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted net income per share amounts: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Fiscal Year Ended January 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 823 &#160; $ 497 &#160; $ 1,208 &#160; Denominator: Weighted average shares for basic net income per share 216 &#160; 220 &#160; 219 &#160; Effect of dilutive securities 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 3 &#160; Weighted average shares for dilutive net income per share 218 &#160; 222 &#160; 222 &#160; Basic net income per share $ 3.81 &#160; $ 2.26 &#160; $ 5.52 &#160; Diluted net income per share $ 3.78 &#160; $ 2.24 &#160; $ 5.44 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe computation of diluted net income per share does not include shares that are anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method because their exercise prices are higher than the average market value of Autodesk&#8217;s stock during the fiscal year. The effect of 962 thousand, 153 thousand, and 90 thousand anti-dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\n16. Retirement Benefit Plans \n\nPretax Savings Plan \n\nAutodesk has a 401(k) plan that covers nearly all U.S. employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 75 % of their pretax salary, subject to limitations mandated by the Internal Revenue Service. Autodesk makes voluntary cash contributions and matches a portion of employee contributions in cash. Autodesk&#8217;s contributions were $ 26 million in fiscal 2023, $ 24 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 22 million in fiscal 2021. Autodesk does not allow participants to invest in Autodesk common stock through the 401(k) plan. \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \n\nAutodesk provides certain defined benefit pension plans to employees located in countries outside of the United States, primarily the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Japan. The Company deposits funds for specific plans, consistent with the requirements of local law, with insurance companies or third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts, and accrues for the unfunded portion of the obligation, where material. \n\nThe projected benefit obligation was $ 76 million and $ 107 million as of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation was $ 69 million and $ 100 million as of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, respectively. The related fair value of plan assets was $ 76 million and $ 112 million as of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, respectively. Our defined pension plan assets are measured at fair value and consist primarily of insurance contracts categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy and an investment fund valued using net asset value. The insurance contracts represent the immediate cash surrender value of assets managed by qualified insurance companies. The assets held in the investment fund are invested in a diversified growth fund actively managed by a third party. \n\nAutodesk recognized an aggregate pension liability for the funded status of $ 5 million and $ 9 million in &#8220;Long-term other liabilities&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, respectively. Our total net periodic pension plan cost was $ 3 million, $ 3 million and $ 3 million for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nOur expected funding for the plans during fiscal 2024 is approximately $ 5 million. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments \n\nEstimated benefit payments over the next 10 fiscal years are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits 2024 $ 3 &#160; 2025 3 &#160; 2026 3 &#160; 2027 3 &#160; 2028 3 &#160; 2029-2033 17 &#160; Total $ 32 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDefined Contribution Plans \n\nAutodesk also provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk&#8217;s funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each country. Autodesk&#8217;s contributions to these plans were $ 39 million in fiscal 2023, $ 38 million in fiscal 2022, and $ 32 million in fiscal 2021. \n\nCash Balance Plans \n\nAutodesk provides a cash balance plan that insures the risks of disability, death, and longevity, in which the vested pension capital is reinvested and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. The weighted-average guaranteed interest crediting rate for cash balance plans was 1 %, 1 %, and 1 % for mandatory retirement savings and 0.3 %, 0.3 %, and 0.1 % for supplementary retirement savings for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. \n\nOther Plans \n\nIn addition, Autodesk offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accordance with terms of the plan. See Note 7, &#8220;Deferred Compensation,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Autodesk, Inc. \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Autodesk, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2023, and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START Revenue Recognition Description of the Matter \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is recognized when the Company's offerings are delivered to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for the products and services. \n\nThe Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and support services. Auditing the Company&#8217;s revenue recognition was challenging and complex due to the effort required to analyze the accounting treatment for the Company&#8217;s various product and service offerings in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This involved assessing the impact of terms and conditions in contracts with customers to determine whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations and the related timing of revenue recognition. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's identification and evaluation of distinct performance obligations and the determination of the timing of revenue recognition. \n\nAmong other procedures, to evaluate management&#8217;s identification and evaluation of the distinct performance obligations and timing of revenue recognition, we read executed contracts for a sample of sales transactions to understand the contract, identify the promised products and services in the contract, and identify the distinct performance obligations and related timing of revenue recognition. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n/s/ ERNST &#38; YOUNG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983. \n\nSan Francisco, California \n\nMarch 14, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\nTable of Contents \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Autodesk, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Autodesk, Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Autodesk, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2023, and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated March 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ E RNST &#160;&#38; Y OUNG LLP \n\nSan Francisco, California \n\nMarch 14, 2023 \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nWe maintain &#8220;disclosure controls and procedures,&#8221; as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), and (ii) accumulated and communicated to Autodesk management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of January 31, 2023. \n\nMANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in the 2013 Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Autodesk have been detected. \n\nOur management has concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &#38; Young LLP, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 herein. \n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the three months ended January 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"
