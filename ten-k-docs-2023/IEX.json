Since the Company serves a wide variety of markets, customer concentrations are not significant. \n\nInternational \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are available worldwide, with manufacturing operations in more than 20 countries. The businesses located outside the U.S. are primarily based in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, India, China and Canada. The Company&#8217;s geographic diversity allows it to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provides greater stability to its operations, allows the Company to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the Company an opportunity to access new markets for products. A strong foothold in these countries has allowed the Company to make great strides to expand its footprint in emerging markets, where the Company believes there is tremendous potential for growth across all segments. \n\nThe following table illustrates sales to customers within and outside the U.S. as a percentage of total sales for total IDEX as well as by segment and by reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Domestic International FMT 57% 43% Pumps 57% 43% Water 58% 42% Energy 62% 38% Valves 14% 86% Agriculture 77% 23% HST 48% 52% Scientific Fluidics &#38; Optics 49% 51% Sealing Solutions 24% 76% Performance Pneumatic Technologies 81% 19% Material Processing Technologies 38% 62% Micropump 28% 72% FSDP 50% 50% Fire &#38; Safety 53% 47% Dispensing 40% 60% BAND-IT 57% 43% IDEX 52% 48% ##TABLE_END\n\nRaw Materials \n\nThe Company uses a wide variety of raw materials which are generally purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has an adequate supply of raw materials necessary to meet demand and continues to actively manage supply chain constraints. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity pricing and inflation and attempts to control these impacts through increased prices to customers and various other programs with its suppliers. \n\nSuppliers \n\nThe Company manufactures many of the parts and components used in its products. Substantially all materials, parts and components purchased by the Company are available from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has a sufficient number of suppliers necessary to meet demand but continues to actively evaluate its current suppliers and identify alternative sources to manage supply chain constraints, as needed. \n\nInventory and Backlog \n\nThe Company regularly and systematically adjusts production schedules and quantities based on the flow of incoming orders. During 2022, backlog was elevated as compared to pre-pandemic levels due to supply chain constraints, which both extended lead times and shifted customer order patterns as well as increased inventory to support production. However, the Company remains a short cycle business and backlog is not considered a significant factor in the Company&#8217;s business as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of the Company&#8217;s products. The Company remains focused on delivering products and services to customers against an elevated backlog and continues to actively manage inventory levels. Further, with respect to order cancellations, the Company has not historically experienced significant order cancellations and does not expect significant order cancellations in the future. \n\nShared Services \n\nThe Company has production facilities in Suzhou, China and Vadodara, India that support multiple business units. During 2021, the Company embarked on projects to expand both the China and India facilities in an effort to increase its footprint in these emerging markets as the Company believes there is tremendous potential for growth across all segments. The China \n\nexpansion was completed in late 2022 and the India facility is expected to be completed in early 2023. IDEX also expanded its facilities in Singapore and Dubai in 2022 to support growth in South East Asia and the Middle East. In addition, IDEX has personnel in China, India, Dubai, Mexico, Latin America and Singapore that provide sales, marketing, product design, engineering and sourcing support to its business units in those regions as well as personnel in various locations in South America, South East Asia, the Middle East, Korea and Japan to support sales and marketing efforts in those regions. \n\nGovernment Regulations \n\nOur compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, international trade, labor and employment, human rights, tax, anti-bribery and competition matters, did not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nEmployees \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had 8,868 employees. Approximately 4% of its employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. which will expire at various times between now and October 2026. Of those, approximately 1% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. which will expire within one year. Management believes that the Company has a positive relationship with its employees. The Company historically has been able to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements satisfactorily, with its last work stoppage occurring in March 1993. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nThe Company recognizes that its success would not be possible without the valuable contributions of its workforce. Investment in people enables the Company to accomplish its goals and deliver innovative customer solutions. The Company&#8217;s corporate Human Capital strategy is overseen by its Chief Human Resource Officer (&#8220;CHRO&#8221;). Annually, the CHRO presents a talent review to the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors focused on senior team development, succession planning for senior management and the general human capital strategy action plan to ensure that the Board is informed on key human capital management matters and to seek alignment on plans for the Company&#8217;s continuity and success. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s workforce advancement strategy is focused through investment in three pillars: skill-building for the entire workforce, leadership development aligned with the Company&#8217;s methodology and fostering a great culture. The Company&#8217;s approach to performance management, talent development management and employee engagement helps drive long-term value by providing employees with opportunities to do and be their best both individually and as teams: \n\n&#8226; As part of our Organizational Talent Cycle process, we conduct regular in-depth talent reviews of our workforce teams and culture with business leaders, identify &#8220;stretch&#8221; opportunities to grow team members, and connect our decentralized businesses by moving skilled employees from one business unit to another as opportunities and interest arise. Employees and leaders have performance and development conversations throughout the year, talking about business and development goals, reviewing progress, recognizing accomplishments, giving balanced feedback, and identifying opportunities for improvement. Open, honest dialog about performance, development and career growth supports our values of trust, team and excellence and The IDEX Difference, building trust and helping us fulfill our purpose. \n\n&#8226; Employees have access to resources that enhance and build capabilities, including specific individual development plans and local training and development programs. In support of our growth strategy and culture, the Company also sponsors global leadership programs through the IDEX Academy which provides accelerated development for key leaders to deepen our pipeline across multiple levels of leadership. Our learning curriculum includes instructor-led, self-paced and blended solutions that have been created internally or sourced from external partners. These offerings also help to develop future and potential leaders in the IDEX leadership methodology. \n\n&#8226; The Company also enables employee development and growth by offering eligible U.S. employees the opportunity to participate in the Tuition Reimbursement program. Through the program, employees can have certain expenses from secondary educational institutions reimbursed up to $5,250 per year. \n\n&#8226; The Company prioritizes hiring team members who will embrace the team-driven culture and also places considerable emphasis on leveraging the talented employees within the Company&#8217;s internal pipeline, filling many leadership positions with Company employees. \n\n&#8226; Across the enterprise, the Company&#8217;s goal is to achieve manufacturing company top quartile employee engagement as measured by its engagement survey. We believe our employees have a high level of engagement as the Company&#8217;s employee engagement index remains above the average for manufacturing companies at 76 percent. \n\nEmployee Pay and Benefits \n\nAttracting and retaining top talent is critical to the success of the Company&#8217;s business. The Company offers a highly competitive pay and benefits package for employees in all the markets where it operates. The performance-based pay packages provide many employees with short-term performance incentives. The Company also provides equity-based, long-term incentives to its senior leaders. In 2022, a number of the Company&#8217;s business units took proactive action with off-cycle pay rate increases for hourly employees with the onset of higher cost of living expenses associated with rising inflation. The Company regularly reviews its compensation structure and intends to adjust pay as necessary to retain key talent. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. employees can participate in a 401(k) retirement plan and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows an employee to purchase IDEX stock through payroll deductions. \n\nDiversity, Equity &#38; Inclusion \n\nThe Company has always recognized diversity as foundational to creativity and resilience; the three pillars of Innovation, Diversity and Excellence form the acronym that is the Company&#8217;s name, IDEX. Gender, ethnic, cultural and other human diversity is critical to the Company&#8217;s success. \n\nIn 2022, the Company launched its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) strategic roadmap. To prepare leadership for the launch, executives participated in a day-long strategy and development session which included a cultural competence assessment and personal feedback for all senior leaders. The Company also: 1) established a Corporate DEI team; 2) embedded DEI initiatives into Executive Leadership Team compensation and goals; 3) launched an Inclusive Leader Development approach; 4) expanded diverse talent recruiting outreach efforts; and 5) established key DEI partnerships. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and CEO regularly review DEI progress. \n\nThe Company has also enhanced the diversity of the Board of Directors in the last year and the Board now comprises 30% women and 30% members who identify with racial/ethnic minority groups. \n\nAdditionally, the Company has increased representation for both women and racially/ethnically diverse individuals in leadership roles. From 2021 to 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the number of women globally in senior leadership roles increased from 28% to 31% and the number of women globally in people manager roles increased from 21% to 22%. In addition, and also as of December 31, 2022, the number of racial/ethnic minority senior leaders in the U.S. increased from 18% to 21%, and the number of racial/ethnic minority people managers in the U.S. held at 19% year over year. The foregoing representation numbers do not include employee populations associated with acquisitions completed in 2021 or 2022. \n\nFurther, the Company has conducted pay equity analyses for U.S. employees since 2018 to ensure that employees&#8217; actual pay was substantially similar to their predicted pay. Where appropriate, the Company provided base pay adjustments for employees that were outliers from their predicted pay, further reinforcing the Company&#8217;s commitment to diversity and a culture of inclusion, equality and respect. \n\nWorkplace Health &#38; Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to providing a workplace that is safe for all of our employees, contractors, business partners and visitors. The commitment to Environmental, Health, and Safety (&#8220;EH&#38;S&#8221;) begins at the corporate and executive level. The program is overseen by the EH&#38;S Senior Director and the Chief Compliance Officer, both of whom are part of the Legal Department. Each of the Company&#8217;s businesses employ local EH&#38;S specialists. These individuals and local safety committees, in conjunction with the corporate team, form the basis of the global EH&#38;S program. The Company&#8217;s corporate EH&#38;S policies are a key part of the global EH&#38;S program. They apply to all of the Company&#8217;s businesses and each business is expected to comply with policies and all EH&#38;S laws and regulations. In addition to the corporate policies, each business develops and implements its own health and safety policies tailored to the local business. \n\nThe Company also encourages employees enrolled in the U.S. Healthcare Benefit Plan to participate in the third-party operated Wellness Program which provides access to annual biometric screenings, health evaluations and wellness credits that can be earned for meeting individual wellness goals each year. In addition, a number of the business units organize complementary wellness programs, including walking clubs, health fairs and &#8220;lunch and learns&#8221; with nutritionists for their employees. \n\nWorker Rights and Protection \n\nThe Company believes that a respectful workplace is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment, and this involves more than just compliance with the law. The Company strives to create a work environment that is free of inappropriate and \n\nunprofessional behavior and consistent with the Company&#8217;s values &#8211; a place where everyone is invited to do their best every day and feel free to report any concerns. The Company has policies, procedures and regular training in place to protect its workforce and prevent workplace harassment and discrimination. This includes a global Code of Business Conduct &#38; Ethics policy where employees agree to follow and receive annual training. The Company also maintains a global hotline where employees are encouraged (and can choose to remain anonymous) to report any concerns or issues. \n\nInformation about Our Executive Officers \n\nSet forth below are the names of the executive officers of the Company, their ages, years of service, the positions held by them and their business experience. \n\n##TABLE_START Name Age Years of Service Position Eric D.

      "text": " Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nFor an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors present risks to the Company and could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of the Company&#8217;s operations and the financial results of its operations elsewhere in this report, the most material of these factors are included below. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks that may affect the Company. Additional risks that the Company is not aware of or does not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nRisks Related to the Company&#8217;s Operations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Inability to Continue to Develop New Products Could Limit Sales Growth. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to its ability to continue to develop new products. A failure to continue to develop and deliver new, innovative and competitive products to the market could limit sales growth and negatively impact the Company and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Growth Strategy Includes Acquisitions and the Company May Not be Able to Make Acquisitions of Suitable Candidates or Integrate Acquisitions Successfully. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s historical growth has included, and the Company&#8217;s future growth is likely to continue to include, acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance its position in existing markets throughout the world. The Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to the Company. \n\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed, uninsured or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted in, and future acquisitions could result in, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. \n\nThe Markets Served by the Company are Highly Competitive and this Competition Could Reduce Sales and Profit Margins. \n\nMost of the Company&#8217;s products are sold in competitive markets. Maintaining and improving a competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and distribution networks. The Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company&#8217;s competitors may develop products that are superior, may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt quicker to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with existing competitors or with new competitors. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of products to stay competitive. Failure to continue competing successfully could reduce sales, profit margins and overall financial performance. \n\nThe Company is Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and Components Used in Its Products and Changes in Supply of, or Price for, Raw Materials, Parts and Components May Materially Adversely Affect the Company. \n\nWhile the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company also requires substantial amounts of raw materials and purchases certain parts and components from suppliers. The availability of and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers&#8217; allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, including due to geopolitical or civil unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, labor disruptions, supply chain disruptions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect the Company and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. \n\nThe Company and its Results of Operations and Financial Condition Have Been and May Continue To Be Materially Adversely Impacted by Public Health Conditions, Including Epidemics or Pandemics Such as COVID-19. \n\nThe Company faces various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a rapidly-changing situation that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears, market downturns and restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy. There have been extraordinary actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions throughout the world, including travel bans, quarantines, &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. Any changes in or resurgence of COVID-19, or any other widespread public health conditions, could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s ability to get the raw materials, parts and components it needs to manufacture its products as its suppliers face disruptions in their businesses, closures or bankruptcy as a result of COVID-19 or other widespread public health conditions. The Company depends greatly on its suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacturing of its products. If its suppliers fail to meet its manufacturing needs in the future, it would delay the Company&#8217;s production and product shipments to customers and negatively affect operations. Further, as new strains or variants of COVID-19 or other viruses, diseases or public health conditions develop or if sufficient amounts of vaccines or treatments are not available, not widely administered or otherwise prove ineffective, the impact of a widespread public health condition on the global economy, and in turn, our financial condition and operating results could be material. \n\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future widespread public health conditions may impact our employees&#8217; ability to work in proximity to others or travel for work. Due to large remote workforce populations resulting from COVID-19 or other widespread public health conditions, the Company may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that it relies on for certain information technologies to administer, store and support the Company&#8217;s multiple business activities. IDEX is heavily dependent on the availability and support of its technology landscape, several of which are provided by external third party service providers (e.g., Microsoft, AT&#38;T and Verizon). Although the Company has not suffered any disruptions to date, any future disruptions in their operations could also negatively impact the Company and its operating results and financial condition. \n\nTo the extent COVID-19 or any future widespread public health conditions adversely affects the Company and its financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this annual report, such as those relating to international operations, the Company&#8217;s ability to develop new products, the Company&#8217;s ability to execute on its growth strategy of acquisitions, the Company&#8217;s dependency on raw materials, parts and components, the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, the effects on the Company that result from declines in commodity prices and the Company&#8217;s reliance on labor availability to operate and grow the business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Business Operations May Be Materially Adversely Affected by Information Systems Interruptions or Intrusion, Including those Arising From Cybersecurity Attacks or Incidents. \n\nThe Company depends on various internal and third party information technologies to administer, store, process and transmit electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees, customers and other business partners) and to support a variety of critical business activities. If these systems (or the systems of the Company&#8217;s customers or third-party hosting services) are damaged or cease to function properly, or if the Company or third-party hosting service systems are subject to deliberate cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access or malicious software, or unintentional cybersecurity incidents, such as those involving systems misconfigurations, misuse or human error and/or other intrusions, the Company, its operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted. These impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays or other detrimental impacts on operations or the ability to provide products and services to its customers; the compromise, destruction, corruption or theft of confidential or otherwise protected information, data or intellectual property; security breaches; other manipulation or improper use of the Company&#8217;s systems or networks; financial losses from fraudulent transactions; financial losses from remedial actions; loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations, actions, penalties or fines, including those arising from the violation of any applicable data privacy laws; and/or damage to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThere has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social \n\nengineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. \n\nWhile the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, the Company&#8217;s systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats or other intrusions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition or results of operations. Given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-security attacks and incidents, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period, and it could take considerable time for the Company to obtain full and reliable information as to the extent, amount and type of information and/or systems compromised. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage, could materially adversely harm our operating results and financial condition. \n\nUncertainty Related to Environmental Regulation and Industry Standards, as well as Physical Risks of Climate Change, Could Adversely Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Position. \n\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. New climate change laws and regulations could require the Company to change its manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for its manufacturing operations. For example, various jurisdictions in which the Company does business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, taxation of or caps on the use of carbon-based energy, limitations or restrictions on water use, limitations or restrictions on the production of single use plastics, regulations on energy management and waste management and other rules and regulations to address climate change and other environmental risks, which may increase the Company&#8217;s expenses and adversely affect its operating results. \n\nIn addition, the physical risks of climate change are highly uncertain and differ in the geographic regions in which the Company operates. These physical risks may impact the availability and cost of materials, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. Any future increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that the Company is required to control, assess and report. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its suppliers, its customers or its products, or the Company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change on the Company, its customers or its suppliers, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Further, any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations or to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals with respect to environmental, social and governance matters may adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions \n\nA Slowdown in the U.S. or International Economy Could Materially Adversely Affect the Sales and Profitability of the Company&#8217;s Businesses. \n\nIn 2022, 52% of the Company&#8217;s sales were derived from domestic operations while 48% were derived from international operations. The Company&#8217;s largest end markets include industrial, semiconductor, automotive, life sciences and analytical instruments, food and pharma, fire &#38; safety, energy, paint, chemical processing, agriculture and water and wastewater treatment. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy and, in particular, any of these specific end markets could materially reduce the Company&#8217;s sales and profitability. \n\nChanges to Geopolitical and Economic Conditions in the U.S. and Foreign Countries in Which the Company Operates Could Adversely Affect the Company. \n\nThe Company expects international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. The Company&#8217;s sales from international operations and sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks include the following: \n\n&#8226; possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations and the risks related to required compliance with local laws; \n\n&#8226; risks of economic instability, including due to inflation; \n\n&#8226; currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation; \n\n&#8226; potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies; \n\n&#8226; disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances; \n\n&#8226; withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the United States and other countries; \n\n&#8226; the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community and the United Kingdom that went into force on May 1, 2021, following the United Kingdom&#8217;s decision to exit the European Union, and other long term economic, legal, political and social implications of the United Kingdom&#8217;s exit from the European Union; \n\n&#8226; the imposition of and changes in the United States&#8217; and other governments&#8217; trade regulations, trade wars, tariffs and other trade barriers, including as a result of geopolitical developments and relations between the United States and China and the United States and Russia; and \n\n&#8226; geopolitical events, including natural disasters, climate change, public health conditions, political instability or other geopolitical events, including civil or political unrest (such as the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection or war. \n\nAny of these events could have a materially adverse impact on the Company and its operations. \n\nSignificant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm the Company&#8217;s Financial Results. \n\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Swedish Krona and Brazilian Real. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which the Company does business against the U.S. Dollar could affect the Company&#8217;s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A , &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; \n\nFluctuations in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect the Company&#8217;s Results of Operations and Financial Position. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. The Company maintains a Credit Agreement with both a term facility and revolving credit facility (together, the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;), which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted Term SOFR (or appropriate alternative currency reference rates) plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the lower of the Company&#8217;s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company&#8217;s applicable leverage ratio. A significant increase in Term SOFR or the other rates the Company has agreed to use as an alternative to Term SOFR (should Term SOFR become unavailable) under the Credit Facility, as amended, would significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of borrowings. Further, any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the discontinuation of the use of Term SOFR and/or the transition to alternative benchmark rates may result in the usage of higher interest rates under the Credit Facility, and the Company&#8217;s current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. The Company is also exposed to risks if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate, which may reduce the availability of and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A , \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\" \n\nA Significant or Sustained Decline in Commodity Prices, Including Oil, Could Negatively Impact the Levels of Expenditures by Certain of the Company&#8217;s Customers. \n\nDemand for the Company&#8217;s products depends, in part, on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of its customers. The level of expenditures by the Company&#8217;s customers is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of the Company&#8217;s customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries. Reduced demand for the Company&#8217;s products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRisks Related to Legal, Accounting and Regulatory Matters \n\nAn Unfavorable Outcome of Any Pending Contingencies or Litigation Could Adversely Affect the Company. \n\nThe Company is currently involved in pending and threatened legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may \n\nalso involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the Company accrues estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions, the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s strategies related to these proceedings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3 , &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 11 in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nFailure to Adequately Protect the Company&#8217;s Intellectual Property and the Risk of Disputes Involving Intellectual Property Infringement Could Adversely Impact the Company&#8217;s Competitive Position, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition. \n\nThe Company owns patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property related to its products and continuously invests in research and development that may result in technological innovations and general intellectual property rights. The Company employs various measures to develop, maintain and protect its intellectual property rights. If these measures are not effective, or if the Company&#8217;s intellectual property is otherwise infringed, challenged, invalidated or circumvented, the Company may face adverse impacts to its results of operations and/or financial condition. Further, if intellectual property is infringed, challenged, invalidated or circumvented, this could reduce barriers to entry into the Company&#8217;s existing lines of business and may result in a loss of market share and adversely impact the Company&#8217;s competitive position. Additionally, the Company has registered intellectual property in multiple countries, and the Company&#8217;s ability to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights may be limited in foreign countries due to differences in intellectual property protections or proprietary rights laws. If the Company&#8217;s intellectual property is infringed, challenged invalidated, or circumvented due to these lesser protections, the Company may face adverse impacts to its results of operations, financial condition, and/or competitive position. \n\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce the Company&#8217;s intellectual property rights or to defend against infringement claims by third parties. Any litigation or claims brought by the Company could result in costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and/or financial condition. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against the Company may lead to litigation expenses, diversion of resources, losses or licensing expenses, or the cessation of selling certain products, any of which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and/or financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill, are a Significant Portion of Total Assets and a Write-off of Intangible Assets or Goodwill Would Adversely Impact the Company&#8217;s Operating Results and Significantly Reduce the Company&#8217;s Net Worth. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At December 31, 2022, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $2,638.1 million and $947.8 million , respectively. These assets primarily result from acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired. Annually, or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation, the Company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company&#8217;s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels, the Company could be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations and net worth. See Note 6 in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets. \n\nThe Company May Face Adverse Effects Resulting from Improper Conduct by Our Employees, Agents or Business Partners. \n\nWhile we strive to maintain high standards, the Company cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or businesses that we acquire or partner with) that would violate laws in the U.S. or foreign countries in which the Company operates, including laws governing payment to government officials, bribery, fraud, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. \n\nIn particular, recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement \n\nactivity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. The Company&#8217;s policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. However, the Company operates in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. Violations of any of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions or penalties, both monetary and non-monetary, increased costs of compliance and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations. \n\nGeneral Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Success Depends on Its Executive Management and Other Key Personnel. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of its executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The loss of the services of any of the executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact on the Company. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust. However, the Company provides long-term equity awards and certain other benefits for its executive officers which provides incentives for them to make a commitment to the Company. The Company&#8217;s future success will depend on its ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and implementation of its strategic plan. \n\nChallenges with Respect to Labor Availability Could Negatively Impact the Company&#8217;s Ability to Operate or Grow the Business. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends in part on the ability of its businesses to proactively attract, motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market. A failure to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business. Additionally, any labor stoppages or labor disruptions, including due to geopolitical unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business. \n\n"

Legal Proceedings. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business as described in Note 11 in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; and such disclosure is incorporated by reference into this Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings.&#8221; \n\nThe Company's threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a government authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1.0 million. \n\nIn addition, the Company and seven of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries, allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos. These components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by the Company or any of the defendant subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company&#8217;s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance, subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover these settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Asbestos-related claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance of the claims have been settled for various immaterial amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the Company&#8217;s business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe the asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n"

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company&#8217;s actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under Item 1A , &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and elsewhere in this annual report. \n\nThis discussion includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that have been defined and reconciled to their most directly comparable measures that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) later in this Item under the headings &#8220;Non-GAAP Disclosures&#8221; and &#8220;Free Cash Flow.&#8221; This discussion also includes Operating working capital which has been defined later in this Item under the heading &#8220;Cash Flow Summary.&#8221; The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. \n\n2022 Overview \n\nIDEX is an applied solutions provider specializing in the manufacture of fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers&#8217; specifications. IDEX&#8217;s products are sold in niche markets across a wide range of industries throughout the world. Accordingly, IDEX&#8217;s businesses are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where it does business and by the relationship of the U.S. dollar to other currencies. Levels of capacity utilization and capital spending in certain industries and overall industrial activity are important factors that influence the demand for IDEX&#8217;s products. \n\nIn 2022, the Company achieved a record year in sales driven by robust demand. The Company&#8217;s ability to capture price amid inflation pressures and its focus on execution drove record earnings per share. Finally, the Company deployed record capital, within its existing portfolio, with the acquisition of three businesses - Nexsight, KZValve and Muon Group - and through share repurchases to support our future goals. \n\nSelect key financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to 2021 were as follows: \n\n&#8226; Sales of $3.2 billion increased 15%; organic sales were up 13%. \n\n&#8226; Net income of $586.7 million increased 31%; Net income margin of 18.4% increased 210 basis points. \n\n&#8226; Diluted EPS attributable to IDEX of $7.71 increased $1.83, or 31%; Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to IDEX of $8.12 increased $1.25, or 18%. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA of $884.2 million increased 16%; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.9% increased 20 basis points. \n\n&#8226; Cash flows provided by operating activities of $557.4 million were down as higher earnings were more than offset by an increased investment in working capital. Free cash flow of $489.4 million was 79% of adjusted net income attributable to IDEX. \n\nFocus for 2023 \n\nDuring 2023, the Company&#8217;s primary focus will be on: \n\n&#8226; Foundational Execution . During 2021 and 2022, the Company experienced both double-digit organic growth and a challenging operating environment characterized by global supply chain constraints, record inflation and continuing effects of the COVID-19 environment. In 2023, the Company will renew its focus on the core elements of its operating model that are designed to drive efficiency, innovation and growth. As market conditions continue to evolve, the Company believes it will leverage its process-driven fundamental business practices to drive above-market growth and operational excellence. \n\n&#8226; Building Great Global Teams. The Company&#8217;s teams have demonstrated their ability to quickly adapt to challenges and changing conditions as well as to solve critical problems for customers. The Company is committed to cultivating talent to fuel future growth and onboarding leaders who are committed to IDEX core values, talent development and creating an inspiring Company culture. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and can bring their true selves to work every day. \n\n&#8226; Capital Deployment. The Company deployed $1.5 billion over the last two years on growth business opportunities, will continue to identify both organic and inorganic opportunities and believes there will be a high quality pipeline for potential acquisitions. The Company believes that its strong operating cash flow and balance sheet enable deployment \n\nof additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses in 2023 to further strengthen its portfolio. The Company anticipates that 2023 organic investment opportunities will be in line with 2022 spending. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Company&#8217;s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. For the discussion related to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 24, 2022. \n\nPerformance in 2022 Compared with 2021 \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 $ % / bps Net sales $ 3,181.9 $ 2,764.8 $ 417.1 &#160; 15 &#160; % Cost of sales 1,755.0 1,540.3 214.7 14 % Gross profit 1,426.9 1,224.5 202.4 &#160; 17 &#160; % Gross margin 44.8 &#160; % 44.3 &#160; % n/a 50 bps Selling, general and administrative expenses 652.7 578.2 74.5 13 % Restructuring expenses and asset impairments 22.8 9.3 13.5 145 % Operating income 751.4 637.0 114.4 &#160; 18 &#160; % Operating margin 23.6 &#160; % 23.0 &#160; % n/a 60 bps Gain on sale of business (34.8) &#8212; (34.8) 100 % Other (income) expense - net (3.9) 16.2 (20.1) (124 %) Interest expense 40.7 41.0 (0.3) (1 %) Income before income taxes 749.4 579.8 169.6 29 % Provision for income taxes 162.7 130.5 32.2 25 % Effective tax rate 21.7 % 22.5 % n/a (80) bps Net income attributable to IDEX $ 586.9 $ 449.4 $ 137.5 &#160; 31 &#160; % Diluted earnings per common share attributable to IDEX $ 7.71 $ 5.88 $ 1.83 &#160; 31 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Sales \n\nSales increased 15%, reflecting a 13% increase in organic sales, a 5% increase from acquisitions (Muon Group - November 2022, KZValve - May 2022, Nexsight - February 2022, Airtech - June 2021 and ABEL - March 2021) net of divestitures (Knight LLC and its related affiliates (&#8220;Knight&#8221;) - September 2022), a 1% increase from the acceleration of previously deferred revenue related to t he exit of a COVID-19 testing application (see Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail ) and a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Sales increased 23% domestically and 7% internationally, and sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 48% and 52% of total sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin \n\nCost of sales increased due to higher sales volume, inflation and acquisitions . Both Gross profit and Gross margin increased primarily due to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and productivity and the acceleration of previously deferred revenue related to the exit of a COVID-19 testing application , partially offset by increases in employee-related costs. Gross profit also increased as a result of acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nSelling, general and administrative (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses increased primarily due to the impact from acquisitions, including amortization, as well as higher discretionary spending, resource investments and employee-related costs. Additionally, the prior year included a $3.5 million impact of a settlement for a corporate transaction indemnity that did not reoccur in 2022. \n\nRestructuring Expenses and Asset Impairments \n\nRestructuring expenses and asset impairments increased primarily due to an asset impairment related to the exit of a COVID-19 testing application, partially offset by lower severance costs in 2022. See Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating income increased 18%, reflecting a 19% increase in organic operating income, a 2% increase from acquisitions net of divestitures (Knight - September 2022), a 1% favorable net impact from the exit of a COVID-19 testing application, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase in organic operating income is attributable to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and operational productivity, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments. \n\nOperating Margin \n\nOperating margin increased 60 basis points, reflecting a 130 basis point increase in organic operating margin, partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease due to acquisitions primarily driven by higher amortization. The increase in organic operating margin is primarily due to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and operational productivity, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments. \n\nGain on Sale of Business \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company completed the sale of Knight for proceeds of $49.4 million, net of cash remitted, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $34.8 million. The Company recorded $5.5 million of income tax expense associated with this transaction as Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nOther (Income) Expense - Net \n\nOther (income) expense - net was $3.9 million of income in 2022 compared to $16.2 million of expense in 2021. The prior year included an $8.6 million noncash loss related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan, net of curtailment and an $8.6 million loss on early debt redemption. Additionally, 2022 included $3.1 million of gains on the sale of assets and $2.5 million of foreign currency transaction gains, partially offset by $2.3 million of losses on trading securities. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates on the Company&#8217;s indebtedness, partially offset by an increase in the amount of debt outstanding compared with 2021 due to borrowings under the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility, both of which were used to fund the acquisition of Muon Group. Additionally, the prior year included $1.6 million of interest expense for the interest rate contract associated with the 4.20% Senior Notes that did not reoccur in 2022. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company&#8217;s provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state, and foreign income. The provision for income taxes increased $32.2 million to $162.7 million in 2022 as compared with $130.5 million in 2021 due to higher earnings. The 2022 effective tax rate of 21.7% decreased compared with the 2021 effective tax rate of 22.5% primarily due to tax benefits realized from the divestiture of Knight as well as from realizing foreign currency impacts in connection with the funding of the acquisition of Muon Group. \n\nResults of Reportable Business Segments \n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies (&#8220;FMT&#8221;), Health &#38; Science Technologies (&#8220;HST&#8221;) and Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products (&#8220;FSDP&#8221;). For a detailed description of the operations within each segment, please refer to Part I, Item 1 , &#8220;Business&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nWithin its three reportable segments, the Company maintains 13 reporting units where the Company focuses on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Management&#8217;s primary measurements of segment performance are sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company changed the segment measure of profit and loss used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, Segment Reporting , from operating income to Adjusted EBITDA. The change in segment measure of profit and loss aligns with how the CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the business. It also allows the Company to better assess operating results over time since it excludes items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. For further discussion related to the Company&#8217;s change in the segment measure of profit and loss used by the CODM as well as the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to Note 14 in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nFluid &#38; Metering Technologies Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Components of Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Change Organic Acq/Div (1) \n\nForeign Currency Total Net sales $ 1,167.3 $ 998.7 17 % 13 % 7 % (3 %) 17 % Adjusted EBITDA 374.2 297.0 26 % 23 % 6 % (3 %) 26 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 32.1 % 29.7 % 240 bps 280 bps (40) bps &#8212; 240 bps ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Acquisitions included KZValve in May 2022, Nexsight in February 2022 and ABEL in March 2021. Divestitures included Knight in September 2022. Based on the timing of its acquisition, ABEL results for the first two months of 2022 are reflected in the acquisitions/divestitures column while the remaining year-over-year impact is included in the organic column. \n\n&#8226; Sales increased 24% domestically and 9% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 43% and 47% of total segment sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n&#8226; The change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Pumps reporting unit due to continued favorable demand in the industrial and energy markets as well as strong price capture. Additionally, there were increases in the Energy reporting unit due to a continued rebound in the refined fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and aviation markets as well as improved operational performance, increases in the Agriculture reporting unit due to strong market performance driven by favorable commodity prices and global demand for crops and increases in the Water reporting unit due to an overall positive municipal water market and water-saving targeted growth initiatives. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.1% increased 240 basis points compared with 29.7% in 2021. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin was attributed to the following: \n\n&#9702; Organic Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 280 basis points due to strong price/cost, favorable productivity and higher volume leverage, partially offset by increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments. \n\n&#9702; Acquisitions negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin by 40 basis points due to the dilutive impact from acquisitions on overall FMT Adjusted EBITDA margin. \n\nHealth &#38; Science Technologies Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Components of Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Change Organic Acq/Div (1) \n\nOther (2) \n\nForeign Currency Total Net sales $ 1,339.2 $ 1,121.8 19 % 15 % 6 % 2 % (4 %) 19 % \n\nAdjusted net sales (3) \n\n1,321.3 1,121.8 17 % 15 % 6 % &#8212; (4 %) 17 % Adjusted EBITDA 411.8 355.9 16 % 13 % 6 % &#8212; (3 %) 16 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 31.2 % 31.7 % (50) bps (70) bps &#8212; &#8212; 20 bps (50) bps ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Acquisitions included Muon Group in November 2022 and Airtech in June 2021. Based on the timing of its acquisition, Airtech results for the first six months of 2022 are reflected in the acquisitions/divestitures column while the remaining year-over-year impact is included in the organic column. \n\n(2) Includes the impact of the acceleration of previously deferred revenue of $17.9 million as a result of a customer&#8217;s decision to discontinue further investment in commercializing its COVID-19 testing application. See Note 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. \n\n(3) Adjusted net sales is calculated as net sales less the acceleration of previously deferred revenue related to the exit of a COVID-19 testing application. It is used in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2022. Refer to Non-GAAP Disclosures in Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for further details. \n\n&#8226; Sales increased 32% domestically and 10% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 52% and 56% of total segment sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n&#8226; The change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Scientific Fluidics &#38; Optics reporting unit due to strong demand across the analytical instrumentation and life sciences markets, favorable but slowing demand in the semiconductor market and targeted growth initiatives tied to Next Gen Sequencing and satellite broadband, in the Performance Pneumatics Technologies reporting unit driven by strength in the industrial market, price capture and targeted growth initiatives tied to fuel cells and in the Sealing Solutions reporting unit due to favorable performance in the semiconductor, oil and gas and automotive markets. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.2% decreased 50 basis points compared with 31.7% in 2021. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin was attributed to the following: \n\n&#9702; Organic Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points due to increases in employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments, partially offset by higher volume leverage and favorable price/cost. \n\n&#9702; Foreign currency positively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points. \n\nFire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Components of Change (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Change Organic Acq/Div Other Foreign Currency Total Net sales $ 679.2 $ 647.9 5 % 9 % &#8212; &#8212; (4 %) 5 % Adjusted EBITDA 183.9 185.7 (1 %) 4 % &#8212; &#8212; (5 %) (1 %) Adjusted EBITDA margin 27.1 % 28.7 % (160) bps (140) bps &#8212; (10) bps (10) bps (160) bps ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; Sales increased 8% domestically and 2% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 50% and 51% of total segment sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n&#8226; The change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Fire &#38; Safety reporting unit due to acceptance of targeted growth initiatives, price realization and backlog execution, in the BAND-IT reporting unit due to strength in the energy market driven by increases in oil prices and in the automotive market driven by share gain as well as continued favorable industrial performance and in the Dispensing reporting unit due to continued favorable paint market, North American project volume and strong performance in India. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.1% decreased 160 basis points compared with 28.7% in 2021. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributed to organic Adjusted EBITDA margin which decreased 140 basis points due to increases in employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as compressed price/cost, partially offset by higher volume leverage. \n\nPerformance in 2021 Compared with 2020 \n\nDue to the change in segment measure of profit and loss discussed above, the following discussion and analysis of the Company&#8217;s segment results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020 has been updated to include Adjusted EBITDA margin for comparative purposes. \n\nFluid &#38; Metering Technologies Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Components of Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Organic Acq/Div (1) \n\nOther Foreign Currency Total Net sales $ 998.7 $ 896.3 11 % 6 % 4 % &#8212; 1 % 11 % Adjusted EBITDA 297.0 271.5 9 % 6 % 2 % &#8212; 1 % 9 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 29.7 % 30.3 % (60) bps (10) bps (40) bps &#8212; (10) bps (60) bps ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Acquisitions included ABEL in March 2021 and Flow MD in February 2020. Based on the timing of its acquisition, Flow MD results for the first quarter of 2021 are reflected in the acquisitions/divestitures column while the remaining year-over-year impact is included in the organic column. \n\n&#8226; Sales increased 5% domestically and 19% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 47% and 44% of total segment sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#8226; The change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Pumps reporting unit due to recovery within the industrial market, in the Water reporting unit due to recovery of the municipal water market and water-saving growth projects and in the Agriculture reporting unit due to increased global demand, partially offset by a decrease in the Energy reporting unit due to a decline in capital spending in the oil and gas markets. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.7% decreased 60 basis points compared with 30.3% in 2020. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin was attributed to the following: \n\n&#9702; Organic Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 10 basis points due to increases to inventory reserves associated with COVID-19 new product development opportunities not materializing and resource investments, partially offset by higher volume leverage and favorable price/cost. \n\n&#9702; Acquisitions negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin by 40 basis points due to the dilutive impact from acquisitions on overall FMT Adjusted EBITDA margin, which was primarily driven by the Flow MD acquisition. \n\n&#9702; Foreign currency negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin by 10 basis points. \n\nHealth &#38; Science Technologies Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Components of Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Organic Acq/Div (1) \n\nOther Foreign Currency Total Net sales $ 1,121.8 $ 896.0 25 % 18 % 5 % &#8212; 2 % 25 % Adjusted EBITDA 355.9 250.9 42 % 33 % 7 % &#8212; 2 % 42 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 31.7 % 28.0 % 370 bps 390 bps &#8212; &#8212; (20) bps 370 bps ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Acquisitions included Airtech in June 2021. \n\n&#8226; Sales increased 27% domestically and 24% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 56% and 57% of total segment sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#8226; The change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Scientific Fluidics &#38; Optics reporting unit due to recovery within the analytical instrumentation market as well as increased microfluidics and optics demand, in the Sealing Solutions reporting unit due to strength in the semiconductor market and improvements in the automotive market and in the Material Processing Technologies reporting unit due to increased demand in the food and pharmaceutical markets. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.7% increased 370 basis points compared with 28.0% in 2020. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin was attributed to the following: \n\n&#9702; Organic Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 390 basis points due to volume leverage and favorable price/cost, partially offset by targeted reinvestment. \n\n&#9702; Foreign currency negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points. \n\nFire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products Segment \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Components of Change (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Change Organic Acq/Div Other Foreign Currency Total Net sales $ 647.9 $ 562.9 15 % 13 % &#8212; &#8212; 2 % 15 % Adjusted EBITDA 185.7 161.5 15 % 13 % &#8212; &#8212; 2 % 15 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 28.7 % 28.7 % &#8212; (10) bps &#8212; &#8212; 10 bps &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8226; Sales increased 17% domestically and 13% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 51% and 52% of total segment sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#8226; The change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Dispensing reporting unit due to strong demand in the paint market and in the BAND-IT reporting unit due to improvements in the aerospace, energy and industrial markets, partially offset by a decrease in the Fire &#38; Safety reporting unit due to a lack of large tenders for rescue tools and North America Fire OEM supply chain constraints slowing order to revenue conversion. \n\n&#8226; Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.7% was flat compared with 2020. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin was attributed to the following: \n\n&#9702; Organic Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 10 basis points due to unfavorable price/cost and mix, partially offset by higher volume. \n\n&#9702; Foreign currency positively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin by 10 basis points. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nLiquidity \n\nBased on management&#8217;s current expectations and currently available information, the Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company&#8217;s common stock for the foreseeable future . Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, working capital was $855.7 million and the Company&#8217;s current ratio was 2.6 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents totaled $430.2 million, of which $373.1 million was held outside of the United States. At December 31, 2022, there was $77.7 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility of $714.4 million. The Company believes that additional borrowings through various financing alternatives remain available, if required. \n\nCash Flow Summary \n\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 557.4 $ 565.3 Investing activities (917.2) (698.1) Financing activities (37.8) (9.5) ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nCash flows provided by operating activities decreased $7.9 million to $557.4 million in 2022 as higher earnings were more than offset by an increased investment in working capital. \n\nOperating working capital, calculated as Receivables - net plus Inventories minus Trade accounts payable, is used by management as a measurement of operational results as well as the short-term liquidity of the Company. The following table details operating working capital as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Receivables - net $ 442.8 $ 356.4 Inventories 470.9 370.4 Less: Trade accounts payable 208.9 178.8 Operating working capital $ 704.8 $ 548.0 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating working capital increased $156.8 million to $704.8 million at December 31, 2022. Acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation contributed $31.9 million to the increase in operating working capital. Excluding those items, Receivables - net increased $63.1 million as a result of higher volume; Inventories increased $79.0 million to support production amid supply chain challenges; and Trade accounts payable increased $17.2 million due to higher inventory purchases. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $219.1 million to $917.2 million in 2022, primarily due to higher cash outflows for acquisitions with the addition of Muon Group, KZValve and Nexsight in 2022 compared to Airtech and ABEL in 2021, partially offset by proceeds received from both the sale of Knight and the sale of marketable securities in 2022 as well as higher proceeds from asset sales in 2022 compared to 2021. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash flows used in financing activities increased $28.3 million from $9.5 million in 2021 to $37.8 million in 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased 795,423 shares at a cost of $148.1 million, paid $177.4 million in dividends, borrowed $210.4 million under the Revolving Facility and $200.0 million under the Term Facility and repaid $135.0 million of the Revolving Facility. During 2021, the Company issued $500.0 million of 2.625% Senior Notes, redeemed $350.0 million of 4.20% Senior Notes and paid $161.1 million in dividends. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nThe Company believes free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is an important measure of performance because it provides a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for payment obligations such as operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company&#8217;s common stock as well as for funding acquisitions and share repurchases. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. \n\nThe following table reconciles free cash flow to cash flows provided by operating activities: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 557.4 $ 565.3 Less: capital expenditures (68.0) (72.7) Free cash flow $ 489.4 $ 492.6 \n\nFree cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income attributable to IDEX (1) \n\n79.2 % 93.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income attributable to IDEX reflects the impact of excluding acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, net of related taxes, from adjusted net income attributable to IDEX in both periods presented . \n\nThe decrease in free cash flow as compared to 2021 is due to the increases in working capital discussed above, which more than offset higher earnings. \n\nCash Requirements \n\nContractu al Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s contractual obligations include borrowings and related interest, purchase obligations, pension and post-retirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, a transition tax payable and other obligations arising in the ordinary course of business (such as acquisition commitments). There are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of the Company&#8217;s credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations. For a description of the funding requirements related to the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations, refer to Note 4 (transition tax payable), Note 7 (borrowings and related interest), Note 10 (lease obligations) and Note 18 (pension and post-retirement obligations) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s purchase obligations, consisting primarily of inventory commitments, totaled approximately $364.4 million, of which $336.4 million is expected to be settled during 2023 and the remainder thereafter. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nCapital expenditures generally include machinery and equipment that support growth and improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities. The Company believes it has sufficient operating cash flows to continue to meet current obligations and invest in planned capital expenditures. In 2022 and 2021, cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of $68.0 million and $72.7 million, respectively. The Company recently invested a significant amount of capital to expand the China facility which was completed in late 2022 and the India facility which is expected to be completed in early 2023, ultimately doubling the Company&#8217;s historic capacity in each of these countries. Otherwise, management considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the Company&#8217;s operations and believes it has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term, especially given its operational improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity. \n\nDebt Repayment \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has $100.0 million of 3.20% Senior Notes due June 2023. The Company expects to either refinance or repay the Notes using the available borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility, due November 2027. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nThe Company repurchased 795,423 shares at a cost of $148.1 million in 2022. There were no share repurchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining was $563.8 million. For additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program, refer to Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCovenants \n\nThe key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility, the Term Facility and the 2016 Private Placement Notes, are a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company&#8217;s interest coverage ratio was 24.39 to 1 for covenant calculation purposes and the leverage ratio was 1.55 to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 2.625% Senior Notes or the 3.00% Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions. For a discussion of the Company&#8217;s Revolving Facility and Senior Notes as well as the associated covenants, refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nCredit Ratings \n\nThe Company&#8217;s credit ratings, which were independently developed by the following credit agencies, are detailed below: \n\n&#8226; S&#38;P Global Ratings affirmed the Company&#8217;s corporate credit rating of BBB (stable outlook) in August 2022. \n\n&#8226; Moody&#8217;s Investors Service affirmed the Company&#8217;s corporate credit rating of Baa2 (stable outlook) in December 2021. \n\n&#8226; Fitch Ratings affirmed the Company&#8217;s corporate credit rating of BBB+ (stable outlook) in March 2022. \n\nDividends \n\nThe Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by 11% from $0.54 per common share in 2021 to $0.60 per common share in 2022. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $177.4 million in 2022 compared with $161.1 million in 2021. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe Company believes that the application of the following accounting policy, which is important to its financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, including the accounting policy discussed below, see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; \n\nGoodwill and intangible assets &#160;&#8212; The Company&#8217;s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. To determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the Company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations. Based on the results of the Company&#8217;s annual impairment test at October 31, 2022, all reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. \n\nThe key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine the fair value. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted EBITDA and terminal growth rates. The following assumption ranges were utilized by the Company in 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START Assumptions 2022 Range 2021 Range Weighted average cost of capital 9.75% to 11.50% 8.25% to 9.75% Market multiples 10.0x to 19.0x 13.0x to 22.0x Terminal growth rates 2.5% to 3.5% 2.5% to 3.5% ##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 6 for further discussion on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. \n\nNon-GAAP Disclosures \n\nSet forth below are reconciliations of each of Organic sales, Adjusted net sales, Adjusted net income attributable to IDEX, Adjusted diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) attributable to IDEX, Consolidated Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221;) and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin to its respective most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management uses these metrics to measure performance of the Company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as fair value inventory step-up charges, restructuring expenses and asset impairments, the impact from the exit of a COVID-19 testing application, gain on sale of a business, gains on sales of assets, the impact of the settlement of a corporate transaction indemnity, the loss on early debt redemption, the noncash loss related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan, net of curtailment and acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. Management also supplements its U.S. GAAP financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. \n\nThis report references organic sales and organic operating income, non-GAAP measures, that exclude (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales and operating income, respectively, from acquired or divested businesses during the first 12 months of ownership or prior to divestiture and (3) the impact from the exit of a COVID-19 testing application. The portion of sales and operating income attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and organic operating income, respectively, and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales and organic operating income, respectively, after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales and organic operating income provides useful information to investors by helping to identify underlying growth trends in the Company&#8217;s business and facilitating easier comparisons of the Company&#8217;s revenue and operating performance with prior and future periods and to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales and organic operating income because foreign currency translation is not under management&#8217;s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult due to the varying nature, size and number of transactions from period to period and between the Company and its peers. The Company excludes the impact from the exit of a COVID-19 testing application because it is not reflective of ongoing operations and can obscure underlying business trends. \n\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, is useful as a performance indicator of ongoing operations. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and its segments&#8217; ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the Company&#8217;s industry. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA margin is useful for the same reason as Adjusted EBITDA. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may differ from that used by other companies. \n\nThis report also references free cash flow. This non-GAAP measure is discussed and reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the section above titled &#8220;Free Cash Flow.&#8221; \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up or recalculate precisely. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. \n\n##TABLE_START 1.

      "text": " Item 7A. &#160; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nThe Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflationary factors. The Company may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Under the policy, the Company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the Company&#8217;s outstanding long-term debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any derivative instruments outstanding. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates \n\nThe Company&#8217;s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the Euro, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi, Swedish Krona and Brazilian Real. The Company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of products. The foreign currency transaction (gains) losses for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $(0.8) million , $1.1 million and $3.0 million , respectively, and are reported within Other (Income) Expense - Net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 1 in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nInterest Rate Fluctuations \n\nThe Company has interest rate exposure due to $277.7 million of the $1,477.8 million debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 being floating rate debt. The Company&#8217;s Revolving Facility and Term Facility both bear interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted Term SOFR (or appropriate alternative currency reference rates) plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the lower of the Company&#8217;s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company&#8217;s applicable leverage ratio. At December 31, 2022, there was $77.7 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 3.32% and $200.0 million outstanding under the Term Facility with an interest rate of 5.83%. \n\nInflation Risk \n\nWe source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers. While materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, they are subject to price fluctuations, which could have a negative impact on our results. We seek to minimize the effects of inflation and changing prices through price increases to maintain reasonable gross margins. \n\n"

      "text": " Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). \n\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. \n\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled &#8220;Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework&#8221; (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Management excluded Nexsight, KZValve and Muon Group ( Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures) from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as these acquisitions occurred in 2022. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management&#8217;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and net sales of current year acquisitions represented were each approxi mately 3 percent of the Consolidated Financial Statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of IDEX Corporation \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded Nexsight, KZValve and Muon Group from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as these acquisitions occurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The combined net sales and total assets of these acquisitions represented approximately 3 percent for each of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at these acquired companies. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nChicago, Illinois February 23, 2023 ##TABLE_END\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of IDEX Corporation \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRevenue - Disaggregation of Revenue - Refer to Note 5 to the Financial Statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is a highly diversified business with a wide range of products and services that are offered in various markets throughout the world. The Company&#8217;s business activities are carried out by numerous individual business units, which offer a unique set of products and include niche markets within specific geographic areas. \n\nWe identified revenue as a critical audit matter given the disaggregated nature of the Company&#8217;s operations and business units generating revenue. This required extensive audit effort due to the volume of the underlying transactions and distinctiveness of each individual business unit. High levels of auditor judgment were necessary to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures and the level of disaggregation within the Company at which to perform such procedures, especially given limited market data for certain products or geographic areas. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company&#8217;s revenue transactions included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including controls over revenue recognition and controls over the review of significant revenue transactions and operating results. \n\n&#8226; For a sample of revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recorded to source documents and determined that revenue was recognized appropriately. \n\n&#8226; For the revenue populations subject to detail testing, we tested the completeness of revenue by making selections from reciprocal populations (e.g., cash receipts) and determined whether the transaction was recorded as a sale in the general ledger. \n\n&#8226; For revenue transactions not subject to detail transaction testing, we aggregated the revenue transactions at the reporting unit level and performed substantive analytical procedures. We developed independent expectations of revenue based on data derived from published industry indices and market and customer trends and compared our independent expectations to the revenue recorded by management. \n\n##TABLE_START /s/ DELOITTE &#38;

All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, allowance for credit losses, inventory valuation, recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, product warranties, contingencies and litigation, insurance-related items, defined benefit retirement plans and purchase accounting related to acquisitions. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when it has approval from both parties, the rights and payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. The Company determines the appropriate revenue recognition by analyzing the terms and conditions of the contract. Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the products or providing the services. Control is transferred to customers when performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. \n\nFor contracts that require complex design, manufacturing and installation activities, certain performance obligations may not be separately identifiable and, therefore, not distinct. As a result, the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. For contracts that include distinct products or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct products or services. Certain contracts have multiple performance obligations for which the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct product or service and recognizes as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For product sales, each product sold to a customer generally represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price. In certain cases, the Company may be required to estimate the standalone selling price using the expected cost plus margin approach, under which it forecasts the expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin for the distinct product or service. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s performance obligations are satisfied at either a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue recognized at a point in time is approximately 96 % while revenue recognized over time is approximately 4 %. For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, generally revenue recognition occurs with the transfer of control of the asset, which is in line with shipping terms. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (i.e. the cost-to-cost method) or ratably over the contract term for service revenue. The Company defines service revenue as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development or manufacture of a product or the delivery of a software license. \n\nWhen accounting for over-time contracts, the Company uses an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company believes this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on its contracts. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material and overhead. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. \n\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of the Company&#8217;s contracts, the Company reviews and updates its estimates regularly. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. The impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, the Company recognizes provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts in the period in which such losses are determined. \n\nThe Company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties (primarily assurance-type) and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company. \n\nShipping and Handling Costs \n\nShipping and handling costs are included in Cost of Sales and are recognized as a period expense during the period in which they are incurred. \n\nAdvertising Costs \n\nAdvertising costs of $ 14.9 million , $ 10.7 million and $ 9.9 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are expensed as incurred within Selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of 3 months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. \n\nMarketable Securities \n\nFrom time to time, the Company may hold investments in marketable securities, which are recorded in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses, dividends and interest income included in Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 9 for further discussion on the marketable securities held by the Company. \n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses \n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at face amount less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is an estimate based on historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial \n\ncondition of its customers and all other forward-looking information that is reasonably available to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision. \n\nInventories \n\nThe Company states inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes material, labor and overhead, is determined on a first in, first out basis. The Company makes adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, for estimated excess, obsolete, zero usage or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering changes. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nA long-lived asset is reviewed for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value, as measured by comparing its net book value to the projected undiscounted future cash flows generated by its use. A long-lived asset impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The amount and timing of the impairment charge for an asset requires the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset. An impaired asset is recorded at its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nAccounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that the Company review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these assets as of October 31 based on the estimated fair value of each of the 13 reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 6 for further discussion on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. \n\nBorrowing Expenses \n\nExpenses incurred in securing and issuing debt are capitalized and included as a reduction of Long-term borrowings. These amounts are amortized over the life of the related borrowing and the related amortization is included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nEarnings per Common Share \n\nDiluted earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) attributable to IDEX is computed by dividing Net income attributable to IDEX by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents outstanding (diluted) during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options, which have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, restricted stock and performance share units. \n\nASC 260, Earnings per Share , concludes that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. If awards are considered participating securities, the Company is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its outstanding shares of restricted stock are participating securities. Accordingly, Diluted EPS attributable to IDEX was computed using the two-class method prescribed by ASC 260. \n\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding reconciles to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 75.7 &#160; 76.0 &#160; 75.7 &#160; Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock and performance share units 0.3 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 0.7 &#160; Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 76.0 &#160; 76.4 &#160; 76.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOptions to purchase approximately 0.5 million, 0.3 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS attributable to IDEX because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of the awards made under its share-based compensation plans. That cost is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 16 for further discussion on share-based compensation. \n\nDepreciation and Amortization \n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: \n\n##TABLE_START Land improvements 8 to 12 years \n\nBuildings and improvements 8 to 30 years \n\nMachinery, equipment and other 3 to 12 years \n\nOffice and transportation equipment 2 to 10 years \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nCertain identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives used in the computation of amortization of identifiable intangible assets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Patents 5 to 20 years \n\nTrade names 5 to 20 years \n\nCustomer relationships 5 to 20 years \n\nUnpatented technology 7 to 20 years \n\nSoftware 5 years ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development Expenditures \n\nCosts associated with engineering activities, including research and development, are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Cost of sales. \n\nTotal engineering expenses, which include research and development as well as application and support engineering, were $ 95.4 million, $ 82.9 million and $ 82.3 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses, which include costs associated with developing new products and major improvements to existing products, were $ 61.4 million, $ 50.1 million and $ 48.2 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively . \n\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction \n\nThe functional currency of substantially all operations outside the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly, those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the income statement amounts have been translated using the average monthly exchange rates for the year. Translation adjustments from year to year have been reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved are reported within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net (gain) loss for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $( 0.8 ) million , $ 1.1 million and $ 3.0 million, respectively. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. See Note 13 for further discussion on income taxes. \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \n\nThe Company is not dependent on a single customer as its largest customer accounted for less than 3 % of net sales for all years presented. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2021-10, Government Assistance (ASC 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance , which requires entities to provide certain annual disclosures when they (1) have received government assistance and (2) use a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis for the annual period beginning January 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which adds contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the ASU&#8217;s provisions prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n2. Acquisitions and Divestitures \n\nAll of the Company&#8217;s acquisitions of businesses have been accounted for under ASC 805, Business Combinations .

See Note 15 for further detail. \n\n(2) Other includes: South America, Middle East, Australia and Africa. \n\nPerformance Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s performance obligations are satisfied either at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time approximated 96 % of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 95 % of total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time approximated 4 % of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 5 % of total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\nContract Balances \n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in customer receivables, advance payments or billings in excess of revenue recognized. Customer receivables include both amounts billed and currently due from customers as well as unbilled amounts (contract assets) and are included in Receivables - net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts are billed in accordance with contractual terms or as work progresses. Unbilled amounts arise when the timing of billing differs from the timing of revenue recognized, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Unbilled amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer as there is not yet a right to invoice in accordance with contractual terms. Unbilled amounts are recorded as a contract asset when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. \n\nThe composition of customer receivables was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In millions) Billed receivables $ 421.3 &#160; $ 344.0 &#160; Unbilled receivables 10.0 &#160; 10.9 &#160; Total customer receivables $ 431.3 &#160; $ 354.9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAdvance payments, deposits and billings in excess of revenue recognized are included in deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the revenue. The current portion is included in Accrued expenses and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Advance payments and deposits represent contract liabilities and are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations satisfied over time. The Company generally receives advance payments from customers related to maintenance services which are recognized ratably over the service term. The Company also receives deposits from customers on certain orders which the Company recognizes as revenue at a point in time. Billings in excess of revenue recognized represent contract liabilities and primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and revenue cannot yet be recognized as the Company has not completed the corresponding performance obligation. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied. \n\nThe composition of deferred revenue was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In millions) Deferred revenue - current $ 44.7 &#160; $ 49.0 &#160; Deferred revenue - noncurrent 15.0 &#160; 32.2 &#160; Total deferred revenue (1) \n\n$ 59.7 &#160; $ 81.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The balance as of December 31, 2022 has been reduced by the acceleration of previously deferred revenue of $ 17.9 million related to a customer&#8217;s decision to discontinue further investment in commercializing its COVID-19 testing application.

In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing 12 month EBITDA and the forward looking 2023 EBITDA (50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. The market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted EBITDA and selected market multiples. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and the income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units. In 2022 and 2021, there were no events or circumstances that would have required an interim impairment test. \n\nThe following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset at December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; At December 31, 2022 &#160; At December 31, 2021 &#160; Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Weighted Average Life Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net &#160; &#160; (In millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; (In millions) &#160; Amortized intangible assets: Patents $ 2.9 &#160; $ ( 1.8 ) $ 1.1 &#160; 12 $ 3.2 &#160; $ ( 2.0 ) $ 1.2 &#160; Trade names 186.5 &#160; ( 71.4 ) 115.1 &#160; 15 140.9 &#160; ( 72.4 ) 68.5 &#160; Customer relationships 772.2 &#160; ( 184.9 ) 587.3 &#160; 13 495.9 &#160; ( 144.2 ) 351.7 &#160; Unpatented technology 207.1 &#160; ( 57.8 ) 149.3 &#160; 12 143.8 &#160; ( 58.8 ) 85.0 &#160; Software 4.8 &#160; ( 0.7 ) 4.1 &#160; 5 &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total amortized intangible assets 1,173.5 &#160; ( 316.6 ) 856.9 &#160; 783.8 &#160; ( 277.4 ) 506.4 &#160; Indefinite-lived intangible assets: Banjo trade name 62.1 &#160; &#8212; 62.1 &#160; 62.1 &#160; &#8212; 62.1 &#160; Akron Brass trade name 28.8 &#160; &#8212; 28.8 &#160; 28.8 &#160; &#8212; 28.8 &#160; Total intangible assets $ 1,264.4 &#160; $ ( 316.6 ) $ 947.8 &#160; $ 874.7 &#160; $ ( 277.4 ) $ 597.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Banjo trade name and the Akron Brass trade name are indefinite-lived intangible assets that were also tested for impairment as of October 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s annual impairment test date. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of these trade names. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. In 2022 and 2021, there were no events or circumstances that would have required an interim impairment test. \n\nAmortization of intangible assets was $ 69.0 million , $ 56.4 million and $ 41.8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on the intangible asset balances as of December 31, 2022, amortization expense is expected to approximate $ 91.2 million in 2023, $ 86.7 million in 2024, $ 85.3 million in 2025, $ 83.6 million in 2026 and $ 79.8 million in 2027. \n\n&#160; \n\n7.

As a result, the 3.20 % Senior Notes remain classified as Long-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. \n\nRevolving Credit Facility and Term Facility \n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company amended and restated that certain five-year $ 800 million Credit Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2019 that was due to expire in May 2024 (the &#8220;Original Credit Agreement&#8221; and, as amended and restated, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) along with certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, with other agents party thereto. The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Revolving Facility&#8221;) in an aggregate principal amount of $ 800 million and a term credit facility (the &#8220;Term Facility&#8221;) available to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $ 200 million, both of which have a final maturity date of November 1, 2027. The maturity date of the Revolving Facility may be extended under certain conditions for an additional one-year term. Up to $ 100 million of the Revolving Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to $ 50 million of the Revolving Facility is available to the Company for swing line loans, available on a same-day basis. \n\nProceeds of the Revolving Facility are available for use by the Borrowers for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed $ 400 million. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used by the Company to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Muon Group. \n\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or Term SOFR rate (or appropriate alternative currency reference rates) plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the better of the Company&#8217;s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company&#8217;s applicable leverage ratio and can range from 0.00 % to 1.275 %. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of Term SOFR rate loans, on the last day of the applicable interest period selected, or every three months from the effective date of such interest period for interest periods exceeding three months. \n\nThe Credit Agreement gives the Company the option to enter into a future environmental, social and governance amendment by which pricing may be adjusted pursuant to the Company&#8217;s performance measured against certain key performance indicators agreed by the Company and BofA Securities, Inc., as sustainability coordinator. \n\nThe Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon the amount of the lenders&#8217; commitments under the credit facility from time to time, equal to the applicable interest rate times the actual daily amount of the Revolving Facility. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the credit facility are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements. \n\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for such senior unsecured credit agreements. There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, excluding the 3.00 % Senior Notes and the 2.625 % Senior Notes which have no financial covenants, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1, which is the ratio of the Company&#8217;s consolidated total debt to its consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;), both of which are tested quarterly and in the case of the leverage ratio, there is an option to increase the ratio to 4.00 for 12 months in connection with certain acquisitions. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each financial covenant under the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, excluding the 3.00 % Senior Notes and the 2.625 % Senior Notes which have no financial covenants. While there are no financial covenants relating to the 3.00 % Senior Notes and the 2.625 % Senior Notes, they are subject to cross-default provisions. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company&#8217;s ability to grant liens, enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company), make certain subsidiary dividends or distributions, engage in materially different lines of businesses and allow subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt. \n\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate). \n\nAt December 31, 2022, there was $ 77.7 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 3.32 % and $ 7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility of approximately $ 714.4 million. In addition, there was $ 200.0 million outstanding under the Term Facility with an interest rate of 5.83 %. \n\nIssuance of 2.625 % Senior Notes in 2021 \n\nOn May 28, 2021, the Company completed a public offering of $ 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625 % Senior Notes due June 2031 (the &#8220; 2.625 % Senior Notes&#8221;). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $ 494.7 million, after deducting the issuance discount of $ 0.6 million, the underwriting commission of $ 3.3 million and offering expenses of $ 1.4 million. The net proceeds were used to redeem and repay the $ 350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 4.20 % Senior Notes due December 15, 2021 (the &#8220; 4.20 % Senior Notes&#8221;) and a $ 6.7 million make-whole redemption premium, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes. The 2.625 % Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.625 % per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2.625 % Senior Notes mature on June 15, 2031. The 2.625 % Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated as of December 6, 2010 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 28, 2021 (the &#8220;Supplemental Indenture&#8221; and, together with the Base Indenture and other supplements thereto, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), between the Company and the Trustee. \n\nThe Company may redeem all or a portion of the 2.625 % Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture and the 2.625 % Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company&#8217;s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets. The terms of the 2.625 % Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 2.625 % Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Indenture also \n\nprovides for customary events of default, which include nonpayment, breach of covenants or warranties in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25 % of the then outstanding 2.625 % Senior Notes may declare the principal amount of all of the 2.625 % Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. \n\nOn May 17, 2021, the Company provided notice of its election to redeem early, on June 16, 2021, the $ 350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 4.20 % Senior Notes at a redemption price of $ 350.0 million plus a make-whole redemption premium of $ 6.7 million using proceeds from the Company&#8217;s 2.625 % Senior Notes. In addition, the Company recognized the remaining $ 1.3 million of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Shareholders&#8217; equity related to the interest rate exchange agreement associated with the 4.20 % Senior Notes and wrote off the remaining $ 0.1 million of deferred issuance costs and $ 0.1 million of the debt issuance discount associated with the 4.20 % Senior Notes as well as $ 0.4 million of deferred taxes for a total loss on early debt redemption of $ 8.6 million which was recorded within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nIssuance of 3.00 % Senior Notes in 2020 \n\nOn April 29, 2020, the Company completed a public offering of $ 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00 % Senior Notes due May 2030 (the &#8220; 3.00 % Senior Notes&#8221;). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $ 494.4 million, after deducting the issuance discount of $ 0.9 million, the underwriting commission of $ 3.3 million and offering expenses of $ 1.4 million. The net proceeds were used to redeem and repay the $ 300.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 4.50 % Senior Notes due December 15, 2020 (the &#8220; 4.50 % Senior Notes&#8221;) and the related accrued interest and a make-whole redemption premium, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes. The 3.00 % Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.00 % per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The 3.00 % Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2030. \n\nThe Company may redeem all or a portion of the 3.00 % Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture governing the 3.00 % Senior Notes. The Indenture and 3.00 % Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company&#8217;s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets. The terms of the 3.00 % Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 3.00 % Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default, which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25 % of the then outstanding 3.00 % Senior Notes may declare the principal amount of all of the 3.00 % Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. \n\nOn April 27, 2020, the Company provided notice of its election to redeem early, on May 27, 2020, the $ 300.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 4.50 % Senior Notes at a redemption price of $ 300.0 million plus a make-whole redemption premium of $ 6.8 million and accrued and unpaid interest of $ 6.1 million using proceeds from the Company&#8217;s 3.00 % Senior Notes. In addition, the Company recognized the remaining $ 1.4 million of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Shareholders&#8217; equity related to the interest rate exchange agreement associated with the 4.50 % Senior Notes and wrote off the remaining $ 0.1 million of deferred issuance costs and $ 0.1 million of the debt issuance discount associated with the 4.50 % Senior Notes for a total loss on early debt redemption of $ 8.4 million which was recorded within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nIssuance of 3.20 % Senior Notes and 3.37 % Senior Notes in 2016 \n\nOn June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of a $ 100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.20 % Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 (the &#8220; 3.20 % Senior Notes&#8221;) and a $ 100 million aggregate principal amount of 3.37 % Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (the &#8220; 3.37 % Senior Notes&#8221; and together with the 3.20 % Senior Notes, the &#8220;2016 Private Placement Notes&#8221;) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement dated June 13, 2016 (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;). Each series of the 2016 Private Placement Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13 th and December 13 th . The 2016 Private Placement Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company&#8217;s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the 2016 Private Placement Notes, provided that such portion is greater than 5 % of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Private Placement Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the 2016 Private Placement Notes by making an offer to all holders of the 2016 Private Placement Notes, subject to certain conditions. \n\nThe Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, incur indebtedness, create liens, transact with affiliates and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or other change of control transactions. In addition, the Company must comply with the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio described above and the Purchase Agreement also limits the outstanding principal amount of priority debt that may be incurred by the Company to 15 % of consolidated assets. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding 2016 Private Placement Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment event of default, any holder of the 2016 Private Placement Notes affected thereby may declare all of the 2016 Private Placement Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the 2016 Private Placement Notes may declare all of the 2016 Private Placement Notes to be due and payable immediately. \n\nTotal borrowings at December 31, 2022 have scheduled maturities as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2023 $ 100.0 &#160; 2024 &#8212; &#160; 2025 100.1 &#160; 2026 &#8212; &#160; 2027 277.7 &#160; Thereafter 1,000.0 &#160; Total borrowings $ 1,477.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n8. Derivative Instruments \n\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges from time to time to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include foreign currency exchange contracts designed to minimize the earnings impact on certain intercompany loans as well as interest rate exchange agreements designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. \n\nThe effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate exchange agreements is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Shareholders&#8217; equity and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is recognized in net income during the period of change. See Note 17 for the amount of loss reclassified into net income for interest rate contracts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any interest rate contracts outstanding. \n\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Company entered into two separate forward starting interest rate exchange agreements in anticipation of the issuance of the 4.50 % Senior Notes and the 4.20 % Senior Notes. The Company cash settled these two interest rate contracts in 2010 and 2011 for a total of $ 68.9 million, which was being amortized into interest expense over the 10 year terms of the respective debt instruments. In conjunction with the early redemption of the 4.50 % Senior Notes on May 27, 2020, the Company accelerated the recognition of the remaining $ 1.4 million of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Shareholders&#8217; equity related to the 4.50 % Senior Notes and recorded it within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2020. In conjunction with the early redemption of the 4.20 % Senior Notes on June 16, 2021, the Company accelerated the recognition of the remaining $ 1.3 million of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Shareholders&#8217; equity related to the 4.20 % Senior Notes and recorded it within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the cumulative unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives. \n\nThe amount of expense reclassified into interest expense for interest rate contracts for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 3.3 million and $ 6.0 million, respectively. \n\n9. Fair Value Measurements \n\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: \n\n&#8226; Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n\n&#8226; Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. \n\n&#8226; Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions. \n\nThe following table summarizes the basis used to measure the Company&#8217;s financial assets (liabilities) at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Basis of Fair Value Measurements &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 &#160; (In millions) \n\nTrading securities - mutual funds held in nonqualified SERP (1) \n\n$ 7.5 &#160; $ 7.5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Basis of Fair Value Measurements Balance at December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 &#160; (In millions) \n\nTrading securities - mutual funds held in nonqualified SERP (1) \n\n$ 11.6 &#160; $ 11.6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Available-for-sale securities - equities (2) \n\n45.3 &#160; 45.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (&#8220;SERP&#8221;) investment assets are offset by a SERP liability which represents the Company&#8217;s obligation to distribute SERP funds to participants. \n\n(2) At December 31, 2021, t he securities were included in Other current assets on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and were available for overnight cash settlement, if necessary, to fund current operations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company sold the securities for &#8364; 39.9 million (or $ 39.7 million) which were originally purchased for &#8364; 40.0 million (or $ 45.3 million). The proceeds from the sale of these securities were used to contribute cash for the acquisition of Muon Group. \n\nThere were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in 2022 or 2021. \n\nThe carrying values of the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the outstanding indebtedness described in N o te 7 based on quoted market prices and current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity was approximately $ 1,328.7 million and $ 1,219.9 million, respectively, compared to the carrying value of $ 1,476.6 million and $ 1,198.7 million, respectively. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are determined based upon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions to entities with a credit rating similar to the Company&#8217;s rating. \n\n&#160; \n\n10. Leases \n\nThe Company leases certain office facilities, warehouses, manufacturing plants, equipment (which includes both office and plant equipment) and vehicles under operating leases and certain plant equipment under financing leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company&#8217;s sole discretion. The Company does not include renewal periods in any of the leases&#8217; terms until the renewal is executed as they are generally not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not have any material purchase options. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s lease agreements have rental payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or that are based on usage. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. \n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Balance Sheet Caption December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (In millions) Right-of-Use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) Assets: Building ROU assets - net - operating Other noncurrent assets $ 104.4 &#160; $ 101.0 &#160; Equipment ROU assets - net - operating Other noncurrent assets 5.6 &#160; 6.2 &#160; Equipment ROU assets - net - financing Property, plant and equipment - net 6.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total ROU assets - net $ 116.1 &#160; $ 107.2 &#160; Lease Liabilities: Current lease liabilities Accrued expenses $ 21.6 &#160; $ 17.6 &#160; Noncurrent lease liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities 96.6 &#160; 93.4 &#160; Total lease liabilities $ 118.2 &#160; $ 111.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRefer to Note 15 for discussion on impairment of building right-of-use assets. \n\nThe components of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) \n\nFixed lease cost (1) \n\n$ 30.8 &#160; $ 31.5 &#160; $ 29.5 &#160; Variable lease cost 2.3 &#160; 2.3 &#160; 1.9 &#160; Total lease expense $ 33.1 &#160; $ 33.8 &#160; $ 31.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes short-term leases, which are immaterial. \n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 31.7 &#160; $ 31.2 &#160; $ 28.7 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities 19.0 &#160; 16.0 &#160; 40.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOther supplemental information related to leases as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Lease Term and Discount Rate December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years): Operating leases - building and equipment 7.43 8.50 Operating leases - vehicles 2.14 2.34 Financing leases - equipment 2.05 &#8212; Weighted-average discount rate: Operating leases - building and equipment 3.41 &#160; % 3.27 &#160; % Operating leases - vehicles 1.70 &#160; % 1.08 &#160; % Financing leases - equipment 4.48 &#160; % &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. \n\nTotal lease liabilities at December 31, 2022 have scheduled maturities as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Maturity of Lease Liabilities (In millions) 2023 $ 24.4 &#160; 2024 21.7 &#160; 2025 19.9 &#160; 2026 15.6 &#160; 2027 12.7 &#160; Thereafter 40.1 &#160; Total lease payments 134.4 &#160; Less: Imputed interest ( 16.2 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 118.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 had scheduled maturities as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Maturity of Lease Liabilities (In millions) 2022 $ 20.1 &#160; 2023 18.3 &#160; 2024 15.6 &#160; 2025 13.3 &#160; 2026 12.0 &#160; Thereafter 48.3 &#160; Total lease payments 127.6 &#160; Less: Imputed interest ( 16.6 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 111.0 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n11.

These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may also involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Although the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\n12. Share Repurchases \n\nOn March 17, 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved an increase of $ 500.0 million in the authorized level of repurchases of common stock. This approval is in addition to the prior repurchase authorizations of the Board of Directors of $ 300.0 million on December 1, 2015. These authorizations have no expiration date. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility.

Income Taxes \n\nPretax income for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was taxed in the following jurisdictions: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) U.S. $ 516.5 &#160; $ 350.2 &#160; $ 296.3 &#160; Foreign 232.9 &#160; 229.6 &#160; 174.0 &#160; Total $ 749.4 &#160; $ 579.8 &#160; $ 470.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Current U.S. $ 102.8 &#160; $ 64.7 &#160; $ 29.5 &#160; State and local 14.5 &#160; 11.0 &#160; 4.6 &#160; Foreign 63.9 &#160; 60.9 &#160; 50.2 &#160; Total current 181.2 &#160; 136.6 &#160; 84.3 &#160; Deferred U.S. ( 12.2 ) ( 4.1 ) 10.1 &#160; State and local ( 1.0 ) ( 1.4 ) 1.5 &#160; Foreign ( 5.3 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 3.4 ) Total deferred ( 18.5 ) ( 6.1 ) 8.2 &#160; Total provision for income taxes $ 162.7 &#160; $ 130.5 &#160; $ 92.5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 &#160; (In millions) Allowances and accruals $ 21.1 &#160; $ 10.3 &#160; Employee and retiree benefit plans 17.8 &#160; 23.6 &#160; Inventories 12.0 &#160; 11.7 &#160; Foreign tax credit and other carryforwards 15.0 &#160; 11.9 &#160; Lease liabilities 26.9 &#160; ( 24.8 ) Right of use assets ( 25.9 ) 25.7 &#160; Depreciation and amortization ( 301.3 ) ( 222.0 ) Other ( 12.8 ) ( 16.6 ) Total gross deferred tax (liabilities) ( 247.2 ) ( 180.2 ) Valuation allowance ( 15.0 ) ( 11.9 ) Total deferred tax (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ ( 262.2 ) $ ( 192.1 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 &#160; (In millions) Noncurrent deferred tax asset - Other noncurrent assets $ 2.0 &#160; $ 4.3 &#160; Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities - Deferred income taxes ( 264.2 ) ( 196.4 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 262.2 ) $ ( 192.1 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company had prepaid income taxes, recorded within Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of $ 15.1 million and $ 9.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe Provision for income taxes differs from the amount calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income. The calculated amount and the differences for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are shown in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Pretax income $ 749.4 &#160; $ 579.8 &#160; $ 470.3 &#160; Provision for income taxes: Computed amount at statutory rate of 21% $ 157.4 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 121.8 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 98.8 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % State and local income tax (net of federal tax benefit) 11.4 &#160; 1.5 &#160; % 8.0 &#160; 1.4 &#160; % 5.9 &#160; 1.3 &#160; % Taxes on non-U.S. earnings-net of foreign tax credits 12.4 &#160; 1.7 &#160; % 9.2 &#160; 1.6 &#160; % 8.4 &#160; 1.8 &#160; % Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income 2.0 &#160; 0.3 &#160; % 0.4 &#160; 0.1 &#160; % ( 2.7 ) ( 0.6 &#160; %) Foreign-Derived Intangible Income Deduction ( 11.9 ) ( 1.6 &#160; %) ( 7.5 ) ( 1.3 &#160; %) ( 4.9 ) ( 1.0 &#160; %) Share-based payments ( 2.6 ) ( 0.4 &#160; %) ( 3.5 ) ( 0.6 &#160; %) ( 9.8 ) ( 2.1 &#160; %) Other ( 6.0 ) ( 0.8 &#160; %) 2.1 &#160; 0.3 &#160; % ( 3.2 ) ( 0.7 &#160; %) Total provision for income taxes $ 162.7 &#160; 21.7 &#160; % $ 130.5 &#160; 22.5 &#160; % $ 92.5 &#160; 19.7 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company has $ 45.3 million and $ 40.6 million of permanently reinvested earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on the $ 45.3 million of earnings that are considered to be permanently reinvested. The Company does not expect these earnings to incur U.S. taxes when ultimately repatriated other than potentially U.S. federal, state and local taxes on foreign exchange gains or losses recognized on the distribution of such earnings. Such distributions could also be subject to additional foreign withholding and foreign income taxes. The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on currently permanently reinvested earnings is estimated to be $ 6.8 million and $ 6.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company repatriated $ 199.9 million, $ 116.0 million and $ 27.0 million of foreign earnings, respectively. These actual distributions resulted in no incremental income tax expense other than tax impacts on foreign exchange gains or losses. These repatriations represent distributions of previously taxed income. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Beginning balance January 1 $ 0.1 &#160; $ 1.1 &#160; $ 3.7 &#160; Gross increases for tax positions of prior years &#8212; &#160; 0.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Gross decreases for tax positions of prior years &#8212; &#160; ( 0.3 ) &#8212; &#160; Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 0.2 ) ( 2.6 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 0.1 ) ( 0.6 ) &#8212; &#160; Ending balance December 31 $ &#8212; &#160; $ 0.1 &#160; $ 1.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has no remaining unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. The tax years 2017-2021 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to the potential federal, state, and foreign examinations, it is reasonably possible that the Company&#8217;s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has minimal deferred tax assets on non-U.S. and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 0.1 million and $ 0.8 million, respectively. The entire balance of net operating losses across jurisdictions, the majority of which relates to acquisitions, is available to be carried forward indefinitely. There is no valuation allowance as it is more-likely-than-not that the net operating losses will be realized. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has deferred tax assets on non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $ 3.0 million with a full valuation allowance. The non-U.S. capital loss can be carried forward indefinitely. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance recorded against foreign tax credit carryforwards for U.S. federal purposes of approximately $ 11.9 million. The U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryforward will expire between 2029 and 2032. \n\n14. Business Segments and Geographic Information \n\nIDEX has three reportable business segments: FMT, HST and FSDP. \n\nThe FMT segment designs, produces and distributes positive displacement pumps, valves, small volume provers, flow meters, injectors and other fluid-handling pump modules and systems and provides flow monitoring and other services for the food, chemical, general industrial, water and wastewater, agriculture and energy industries. FMT application-specific pump and metering solutions serve a diverse range of end markets, including industrial infrastructure (fossil fuels, refined and alternative fuels and water and wastewater), energy, chemical processing, agriculture, food and beverage, semiconductor, pulp and paper, automotive/transportation, plastics and resins, electronics and electrical, construction and mining, pharmaceutical and bio-pharmaceutical, machinery and numerous other specialty niche markets. \n\nThe HST segment designs, produces and distributes a wide range of precision fluidics, rotary lobe pumps, centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, roll compaction and drying systems, micro-precision components, pneumatic components and sealing solutions, high performance molded and extruded sealing components, custom mechanical and shaft seals, engineered hygienic mixers and valves, biocompatible medical devices and implantables, air compressors and blowers, optical components and coatings, laboratory and commercial equipment, precision photonic solutions and precision gear and peristaltic pump technologies. HST serves a variety of end markets, including food and beverage, life sciences, analytical instruments, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical, industrial, semiconductor, digital printing, automotive/transportation, medical/dental, energy, cosmetics, marine, chemical, wastewater and water treatment, research and aerospace/defense markets. \n\nThe FSDP segment designs, produces and distributes firefighting pumps, valves and controls, rescue tools, lifting bags and other components and systems for the fire and rescue industry, engineered stainless steel banding and clamping devices used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications in the automotive, energy and industrial markets and precision equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing colorants and paints used in a variety of retail and commercial businesses in the paint and industrial markets around the world. \n\nInformation on the Company&#8217;s business segments is presented below based on the nature of the products and services offered. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as its principal measure of segment performance. Intersegment sales are accounted for at fair value as if the sales were to third parties. \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company changed the segment measure of profit and loss used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting , from operating income to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, before fair value inventory step-up charges, restructuring expenses and asset impairments, the impact from the exit of a COVID-19 testing application, the gain on sale of a business, the gains on sales of assets, the impact of the settlement of a corporate transaction indemnity, the loss on early debt redemption and the noncash loss related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan, net of curtailment. The change in segment measure of profit and loss aligns with how the CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the business. It also allows the Company to better assess operating results over time since it excludes items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) NET SALES Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies External customers $ 1,166.2 &#160; $ 998.0 &#160; $ 895.4 &#160; Intersegment sales 1.1 &#160; 0.7 &#160; 0.9 &#160; Total segment sales 1,167.3 &#160; 998.7 &#160; 896.3 &#160; Health &#38; Science Technologies External customers 1,336.8 &#160; 1,119.0 &#160; 893.4 &#160; Intersegment sales 2.4 &#160; 2.8 &#160; 2.6 &#160; Total segment sales 1,339.2 &#160; 1,121.8 &#160; 896.0 &#160; Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products External customers 678.9 &#160; 647.8 &#160; 562.8 &#160; Intersegment sales 0.3 &#160; 0.1 &#160; 0.1 &#160; Total segment sales 679.2 &#160; 647.9 &#160; 562.9 &#160; Intersegment eliminations ( 3.8 ) ( 3.6 ) ( 3.6 ) Net sales $ 3,181.9 &#160; $ 2,764.8 &#160; $ 2,351.6 &#160; ADJUSTED EBITDA Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies $ 374.2 &#160; $ 297.0 &#160; $ 271.5 &#160; Health &#38; Science Technologies 411.8 &#160; 355.9 &#160; 250.9 &#160; Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products 183.9 &#160; 185.7 &#160; 161.5 &#160; Segment Adjusted EBITDA 969.9 &#160; 838.6 &#160; 683.9 &#160; Corporate and other ( 85.7 ) ( 73.2 ) ( 61.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA 884.2 &#160; 765.4 &#160; 622.9 &#160; - Interest expense ( 40.7 ) ( 41.0 ) ( 44.8 ) - Depreciation ( 50.7 ) ( 46.6 ) ( 41.7 ) - Amortization ( 69.0 ) ( 56.4 ) ( 41.8 ) - Fair value inventory step-up charges ( 8.5 ) ( 11.6 ) ( 4.1 ) - Restructuring expenses and asset impairments ( 4.5 ) ( 9.3 ) ( 11.8 ) &#160;- Net impact from the exit of a COVID-19 testing application (1) \n\n1.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; - Corporate transaction indemnity &#8212; &#160; ( 3.5 ) &#8212; &#160; + Gain on sale of business 34.8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; + Gain on sales of assets 2.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; - Loss on early debt redemption &#8212; &#160; ( 8.6 ) ( 8.4 ) - Termination of the U.S. pension plan, net of curtailment &#8212; &#160; ( 8.6 ) &#8212; &#160; Income before income taxes $ 749.4 &#160; $ 579.8 &#160; $ 470.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents the net impact of the acceleration of previously deferred revenue of $ 17.9 million and an impairment charge of $ 16.8 million as a result of a customer&#8217;s decision to discontinue further investment in commercializing its COVID-19 testing application.

Restructuring Expenses and Asset Impairments \n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred restructuring costs to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, consisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization and contract termination costs. Restructuring costs include severance costs, exit costs and asset impairments and are included in Restructuring expenses and asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, COBRA subsidies, outplacement services, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of lease exit and contract termination costs. \n\n2022 Initiative \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the restructuring costs incurred by the Company primarily related to asset impairments. In addition, the Company also incurred severance costs related to employee reductions. \n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company engaged in the development of a COVID-19 testing application with a customer at one of its businesses in the HST segment. As part of this contract, the customer fully funded the $ 28.7 million investment needed to complete the development and production of microfluidic cartridges during 2020 and 2021. The costs incurred by the Company were primarily recorded as Property, plant and equipment &#8211; net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were being depreciated over the expected life of the assets, while the reimbursement was recorded as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was being recognized as units were shipped. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022 , the Company was informed by the customer of its decision to discontinue further investment in commercializing its COVID-19 testing application. This event was deemed a triggering event, which required an interim impairment test be performed on the property, plant and equipment related to this contract, resulting in an impairment charge of $ 16.8 million that was recorded as Restructuring expenses and asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2022 . In addition, the Company accelerated previously deferred revenue of $ 17.9 million related to units that are no longer expected to be shipped and recorded as Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2022 . \n\nPre-tax restructuring expenses and asset impairments by segment for the 2022 initiative were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Severance Costs Exit Costs Asset Impairments Total &#160; (In millions) Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies $ 1.9 &#160; $ 0.3 &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; $ 2.7 &#160; Health &#38; Science Technologies 1.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 16.8 &#160; 18.0 &#160; Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products 1.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.1 &#160; 1.8 &#160; Corporate/Other 0.3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.3 &#160; Total restructuring costs $ 5.1 &#160; $ 0.3 &#160; $ 17.4 &#160; $ 22.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n2021 Initiative \n\nDuring the year ended year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred severance costs related to employee reductions. In addition, the Company consolidated certain facilities within the FMT segment which resulted in asset impairments of $ 0.8 million related to property, plant and equipment that was not relocated to the new locations. \n\nPre-tax restructuring expenses and asset impairments by segment for the 2021 initiative were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Severance Costs Exit Costs Asset Impairments Total &#160; (In millions) Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies $ 3.7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 0.8 &#160; $ 4.5 &#160; Health &#38; Science Technologies 1.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.7 &#160; Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products 0.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.5 &#160; Corporate/Other 2.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.6 &#160; Total restructuring costs $ 8.5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 0.8 &#160; $ 9.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n2020 Initiative \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred severance costs related to employee reductions and exit costs related to early lease terminations. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company consolidated certain facilities within the FMT segment, which resulted in an impairment charge of $ 2.5 million. The Company also relocated its corporate office, which resulted in an impairment charge of $ 0.6 million. \n\nPre-tax restructuring expenses and asset impairments by segment for the 2020 initiative were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Severance Costs Exit Costs Asset Impairments Total &#160; (In millions) Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies $ 2.9 &#160; $ 0.2 &#160; $ 2.5 &#160; $ 5.6 &#160; Health &#38; Science Technologies 2.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.7 &#160; Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products 2.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.5 &#160; Corporate/Other 0.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.6 &#160; 1.0 &#160; Total restructuring costs $ 8.5 &#160; $ 0.2 &#160; $ 3.1 &#160; $ 11.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRestructuring accruals reflected in Accrued expenses in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Restructuring Initiatives &#160; (In millions) Balance at January 1, 2021 $ 3.9 &#160; Restructuring expenses (1) \n\n8.5 &#160; Payments, utilization and other ( 9.6 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 2.8 &#160; Restructuring expenses (2) \n\n5.4 &#160; Payments, utilization and other ( 6.8 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 1.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes $ 0.8 million of asset impairments related to property, plant and equipment. \n\n(2) Excludes $ 17.4 million of asset impairments related to property, plant and equipment. \n\n16. Share-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company maintains two share-based compensation plans for executives, non-employee directors and certain key employees that authorize the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance share units and other types of awards consistent with the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company&#8217;s plans as of December 31, 2022 totaled 15.6 million, of which 2.0 million shares were available for future issuance. \n\nThe Company typically grants equity awards annually at its regularly scheduled first quarter meeting of the Board of Directors based on the recommendation from the Compensation Committee. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, assuming forfeitures, over the requisite service period for the entire award. Classification of stock compensation cost within the Consolidated Statements of Income is consistent with classification of cash compensation for the same employees. \n\nStock Options \n\nStock options granted under the Company&#8217;s plans are generally non-qualified and are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using the Binomial lattice option pricing model (for options granted before March 2021) or the Black Scholes valuation model (for options granted after February 2021). The adoption of the Black Scholes model in 2021 was driven by a review of option exercise history, which more closely aligned with the methodology of the Black Scholes model. Stock options generally vest ratably over four years , with vesting beginning one year from the date of grant, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. The service period for certain retiree eligible participants is accelerated. \n\nWeighted average option fair values and assumptions for the periods specified are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average fair value of grants $ 42.66 $ 38.88 $ 34.22 Dividend yield 1.14 % 1.01 % 1.15 % Volatility 25.23 % 23.78 % 22.04 % Risk-free interest rate 2.01 % 0.12 % - 1.54 % \n\n1.39 % - 1.66 % \n\nExpected life (in years) 4.90 5.70 5.80 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe assumptions are as follows: \n\n&#8226; The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the contractual term of the option (for the Binomial lattice option pricing model) or over the expected life of the option (for the Black Scholes valuation model). \n\n&#8226; The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life of the option. The expected life assumption for options granted before March 2021 is an output of the Binomial lattice option pricing model, which incorporates vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option to define expected employee behavior. The expected life assumption for options granted after March 2021 is based on IDEX&#8217;s own exercise and cancellation history, adjusted for current vesting schedules. \n\n&#8226; The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option (for the Binomial lattice option pricing model) or commensurate with the expected life of the option (for the Black Scholes valuation model). For options granted before March 2021, the Company presents the range of risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice option pricing model. For options granted after March 2021, the Company presents the spot rate used in the Black Scholes valuation model. \n\n&#8226; The expected dividend yield is based on the Company&#8217;s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the option. \n\nA summary of the Company&#8217;s stock option activity as of December 31, 2022, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Shares Weighted Average Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in millions except weighted average price) Stock Options Outstanding at January 1, 2022 1,008,586 &#160; $ 147.60 &#160; 6.97 $ 89.5 &#160; Granted 288,855 &#160; 190.43 &#160; Exercised ( 171,061 ) 112.67 &#160; Forfeited/Expired ( 110,808 ) 186.25 &#160; Outstanding at December 31, 2022 1,015,572 &#160; $ 161.45 &#160; 6.94 $ 67.9 &#160; Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2022 982,705 &#160; $ 160.46 &#160; 6.88 $ 66.7 &#160; Exercisable at December 31, 2022 489,720 &#160; $ 134.20 &#160; 5.41 $ 46.1 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe intrinsic value for stock options outstanding and exercisable is defined as the difference between the market value of the Company&#8217;s common stock as of the end of the period and the grant price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 17.4 million, $ 21.4 million and $ 41.3 million, respectively. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, cash received from options exercised was $ 19.3 million, $ 19.7 million and $ 44.6 million, respectively, while the actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from stock options exercised totaled $ 3.7 million, $ 4.5 million and $ 8.7 million, respectively. \n\nTotal compensation cost for stock options is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Cost of goods sold $ 0.5 &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; $ 0.5 &#160; Selling, general and administrative expenses 8.7 &#160; 8.0 &#160; 7.6 &#160; Total expense before income taxes 9.2 &#160; 8.5 &#160; 8.1 &#160; Income tax benefit ( 0.8 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.9 ) Total expense after income taxes $ 8.4 &#160; $ 7.7 &#160; $ 7.2 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 8.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years. \n\nRestricted Stock \n\nRestricted stock awards generally cliff vest after three years for employees and non-employee directors.

Performance share units are expected to be made annually and are paid out at the end of a three-year period based on the Company&#8217;s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of IDEX common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of companies in the S&#38;P 500 Index for the three-year period following the date of grant. The payment of awards following the three-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in \n\nthe plan agreement and may range from 0 percent to 250 percent of the initial grant. A target payout of 100 percent is earned if total shareholder return is equal to the 50 th percentile of the peer group. Performance share units earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of performance share units that are earned. Payments made at the end of the award period will be in the form of stock for performance share units and will be in cash for dividend equivalents. The Company&#8217;s performance share units are market condition awards, have been assessed at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and are expensed ratably over the three-year term of the awards. The Company granted 31,370 , 29,020 and 42,690 performance share units in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nWeighted average performance share unit fair values and assumptions for the period specified are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average fair value of grants $ 235.54 $ 247.49 $ 224.14 Dividend yield &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % Volatility 28.09 % 28.60 % 19.50 % Risk-free interest rate 1.73 % 0.33 % 1.30 % Expected life (in years) 2.93 2.93 2.94 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe assumptions are as follows: \n\n&#8226; The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the remaining performance period as of the grant date. \n\n&#8226; The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses an expected life commensurate with the performance period. As a result, the expected life of the performance share units was assumed to be the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period. \n\n&#8226; The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term commensurate with the remaining performance period. \n\n&#8226; Total Shareholder Return is determined assuming that dividends are reinvested in the issuing entity over the performance period, which is mathematically equivalent to utilizing a 0 % dividend yield. \n\nA summary of the Company&#8217;s performance share unit activity as of December 31, 2022, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2022, is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Performance Share Units Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at January 1, 2022 52,025 &#160; $ 236.75 &#160; Granted 31,370 &#160; 235.54 &#160; \n\nVested (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Forfeited ( 12,480 ) 235.88 &#160; Unvested at December 31, 2022 70,915 &#160; $ 236.66 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The performance period for the 2020 grants ended as of January 31, 2023.

Retirement Benefits \n\nThe Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as other post-retirement plans for its employees. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans. The Company employs the measurement date provisions of ASC 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits , which require the measurement date of plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor&#8217;s year end. \n\nThe IDEX Corporation Retirement Plan (&#8220;Plan&#8221;), a U.S. defined benefit plan, was terminated in May 2020. As a result of the termination, the settlement threshold was reached in early 2020 and the Company recorded a settlement charge of $ 0.9 million in Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The settlement also triggered the remeasurement of net periodic benefit cost resulting in a reduction of $ 1.0 million to Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of significant decreases in discount rates and strong asset performance in 2020. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company settled its remaining obligations under the Plan through a combination of lump-sum payments to eligible participants who elected them, and through the purchase of annuities from Legal and General, an A rated third-party insurer. The Company recognized a net loss of $ 9.7 million, which was recorded within Other (income) expense - net. The net loss consisted of $ 10.7 million related to previously deferred pension related costs, partially offset by $ 1.0 million related to an increase in plan assets remaining after the settlement. As of December 31, 2021, the Plan had surplus assets of approximately $ 10.2 million, representing cash equivalents held in a trust. These plan assets were included in Other current assets on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pension Plan for Hourly Employees at Rochester, New York, a discount rate of 3.21 % was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 and a discount rate of 2.62 % was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 as a result of the remeasurement that occurred in conjunction with the ratification of the collective bargaining agreement. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Other Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.70 &#160; % 2.20 &#160; % 3.09 &#160; % Expected return on plan assets &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % Rate of compensation increase &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % 4.00 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe pretax change recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2022 is as follows: ##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits Other Benefits &#160; U.S. Non-U.S. &#160; (In millions) Net gain (loss) in current year $ ( 0.1 ) $ 16.0 &#160; $ 7.3 &#160; Prior service cost &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 0.3 &#160; ( 0.1 ) ( 0.1 ) Amortization of net loss (gain) &#8212; &#160; 0.8 &#160; ( 0.3 ) Exchange rate effect on amounts in other comprehensive income &#8212; &#160; 1.4 &#160; ( 0.1 ) Total $ 0.2 &#160; $ 18.1 &#160; $ 6.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe discount rates for the Company&#8217;s plans are derived by matching the plan&#8217;s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same present value of cash flows. \n\nIn selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the plan&#8217;s target asset allocation and current market conditions. \n\nPrior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of 10 % of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants. \n\nCosts of defined contribution plans were $ 16.1 million, $ 12.8 million and $ 12.5 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in certain multi-employer pension plans covering approximately 216 participants under U.S. collective bargaining agreements. None of these plans are considered individually significant to the Company as contributions to these plans totaled $ 0.8 million, $ 1.0 million, and $ 1.1 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nFor measurement purposes, a 5.59 % weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2022. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually each year to a rate of 4.00 % for 2040 , and remain at that level thereafter. \n\n&#160; \n\nPlan Assets \n\nThe Company&#8217;s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity securities 9 &#160; % 4 &#160; % 13 &#160; % 18 &#160; % Fixed income securities 84 &#160; % 33 &#160; % 19 &#160; % 22 &#160; % Cash/Commingled Funds/Other (1) 7 &#160; % 63 &#160; % 68 &#160; % 60 &#160; % Total 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe basis used to measure the defined benefit plans&#8217; assets at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 is summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Basis of Fair Value Measurement &#160; Outstanding Balances Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As of December 31, 2022 (In millions) Equity U.S. Large Cap $ 0.2 &#160; $ 0.2 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; U.S. Small / Mid Cap 2.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; International 2.5 &#160; 0.8 &#160; 1.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed Income U.S. Intermediate 1.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. Long Term 3.8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.8 &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. High Yield 0.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; International 5.4 &#160; 0.2 &#160; 5.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nOther Commingled Funds (1) \n\n23.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23.7 &#160; Cash and Equivalents 1.0 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 0.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other 1.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 42.5 &#160; $ 1.6 &#160; $ 17.2 &#160; $ 23.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n(1) Other commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments in non-U.S. plans. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Basis of Fair Value Measurement &#160; Outstanding Balances Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 As of December 31, 2021 (In millions) Equity U.S. Large Cap $ 0.3 &#160; $ 0.3 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; U.S. Small / Mid Cap 4.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4.6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; International 4.2 &#160; 1.0 &#160; 3.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed Income U.S. Intermediate 1.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. Long Term 5.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5.4 &#160; &#8212; &#160; U.S. High Yield 0.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 0.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; International 7.5 &#160; 0.3 &#160; 7.2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nOther Commingled Funds (1) \n\n23.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 23.7 &#160; Cash and Equivalents 12.1 &#160; 11.0 &#160; 1.1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other 2.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2.7 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 63.1 &#160; $ 12.6 &#160; $ 26.8 &#160; $ 23.7 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Other commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments in non-U.S. plans. \n\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. \n\nInvestment Policies and Strategies \n\nThe investment objective of the U.S. plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn the highest possible total rate of return consistent with the plan&#8217;s tolerance for risk. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that &#8220;equities&#8221; will constitute 10 % and &#8220;fixed income&#8221; obligations, including cash, will constitute 90 % of the market value of total fund assets. \n\nThe investment objective of the UK plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn a target return of UK Gilts plus approximately 3.1 % per year. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that &#8220;equities&#8221; will constitute from 57 % to 67 % of the market value of total fund assets with a target of 62 %, and &#8220;fixed income&#8221; obligations, including cash, will constitute from 33 % to 43 % with a target of 38 %. The UK Plan also has a framework in place such that if the funding position (which is monitored daily) improves to a certain level, the asset allocation will switch out of equities into fixed income assets in order to lower the level of risk of the investments. \n\nThe term &#8220;equities&#8221; includes common stock, while the term &#8220;fixed income&#8221; includes obligations with contractual payments and a specific maturity date. Diversification of assets is employed to ensure that adverse performance of one security or security class does not have an undue detrimental impact on the portfolio as a whole. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by type, characteristic and number of investments as well as by investment style of designated investment fund managers. No restrictions are placed on the selection of individual investments by the investment fund managers. The total fund performance and the performance of the investment fund managers is reviewed on a regular basis using an appointed professional independent advisor. As of December 31, 2022, there were no shares of the Company&#8217;s stock held in plan assets. \n\nCash Flows \n\nThe Company expects to contribute approximately $ 3.9 million to its defined benefit plans and $ 1.1 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2023. The Company also expects to contribute approximately $ 16.2 million to its defined contribution plan and $ 12.1 million to its 401(k) savings plan in 2023 using cash on hand. \n\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments \n\nThe future estimated benefit payments for the next five years and the five years thereafter are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Estimated Future Benefits (In millions) 2023 $ 6.2 &#160; 2024 6.0 &#160; 2025 6.0 &#160; 2026 6.2 &#160; 2027 6.2 &#160; 2028 to 2032 30.7 &#160; Total Estimated Future Benefit Payments $ 61.3 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n"
