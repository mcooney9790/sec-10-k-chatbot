BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END\n\nGENERAL \n\nApache Corporation, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation (APA), is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs. The Company&#8217;s upstream business currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, the Company&#8217;s midstream business was operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owned, developed, and operated a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas. \n\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company consummated a holding company reorganization (the Holding Company Reorganization), pursuant to which the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA, and all of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of APA. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, APA became the successor issuer to the Company pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act and replaced the Company as the public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;APA.&#8221; The Holding Company Reorganization modernized APA&#8217;s operating and legal structure to more closely align with its growing international presence, making it more consistent with other companies that have affiliates operating around the globe. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail. \n\nThrough APA&#8217;s website, www.apacorp.com , you can access, free of charge, electronic copies of the documents the Company files with the SEC, including the Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to these reports.

Additional data and discussion are provided in Part II, Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n##TABLE_START Production Percentage of Total Production Production Revenue Year-End Estimated Proved Reserves Percentage of Total Estimated Proved Reserves Gross Wells Drilled Gross Productive Wells Drilled (In MMboe) (In millions) (In MMboe) United States 73.9 52 % $ 3,949 573 67 % 74 74 \n\nEgypt (1) \n\n52.8 38 % 3,521 184 21 % 97 82 \n\nNorth Sea (2) \n\n14.4 10 % 1,558 99 12 % 2 2 Total 141.1 100 % $ 9,028 856 100 % 173 158 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Apache&#8217;s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of noncontrolling interests contributed 22 percent of 2022 production and accounted for 11 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. \n\n(2) Sales volumes from the Company&#8217;s North Sea assets for 2022 were 14.9 MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field. \n\nUnited States \n\nIn 2022, Apache&#8217;s U.S. upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately 52 percent of production, 44 percent of oil and gas revenues, and 67 percent of estimated year-end proved reserves, consistent with prior years. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 3.5 million gross acres (1.7 million net acres) in the U.S., 74 percent of which are undeveloped. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. assets are primarily located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, including the Permian sub-basins: Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays being developed within these sub-basins include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry. Apache is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, operating approximately 6,000 gross oil and gas wells across its acreage, with additional interests in more than 3,000 non-operated wells. Of note, approximately six percent of the Company&#8217;s net acreage position in the Permian Basin is on federal onshore lands. Apache also has operations located in the Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk areas of Southeast Texas, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and along the Gulf Coast in South Texas and Louisiana. \n\nHighlights of the Company&#8217;s operations in the U.S. include: \n\n&#8226; Southern Midland Basin Apache holds approximately 789,000 gross acres (451,000 net acres) in the Southern Midland Basin and the Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk areas of southeast Texas. During 2022, the Company averaged two rigs targeting oil plays in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations, drilling 52 gross development wells in this basin with a 100 percent success rate. \n\n&#8226; Delaware Basin Apache holds approximately 223,000 gross acres (127,000 net acres) in the Delaware Basin, including opportunities in the Bone Spring and other formations of Eastern New Mexico and bordering West Texas, and the Alpine High play in the southern portion of the Permian Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas. During 2022, the Company completed 22 gross development wells with a 100 percent success rate. \n\n&#8226; Legacy Assets Apache holds approximately 2.5 million gross acres (1.1 million net acres) in legacy properties, of which 663,000 gross acres are in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Consistent with the Company&#8217;s broader portfolio management efforts, certain non-strategic leasehold positions on its legacy acreage holdings provide additional monetization opportunities that continue to be evaluated. \n\n&#8226; New Venture Assets Apache separately has undeveloped acreage positions across several states where it intends to pursue exploration interests and potential development opportunities over time. \n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining a safe, steady, and efficient level of activity as part of its three-year capital investment program. For 2023, the Company will continue to budget its capital program at levels to fund activity necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future rig activity levels and drilling targets will be dependent on the success of the Company&#8217;s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically. \n\nU.S. Marketing The Company sells its U.S. natural gas production at liquid index sales points within the U.S., at either monthly or daily index-based prices. In addition, to satisfy a delivery commitment beginning in 2023, the Company will purchase third party natural gas to sell and deliver to a U.S. LNG export facility. The tenor of the Company&#8217;s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies, as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk. \n\nApache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil production to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing indices (e.g. WTI Houston, West Texas Sour (WTS), WTI Midland, or West Texas Light (WTL) Midland) and some predominately Brent related international pricing indices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential. Apache&#8217;s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide an opportunity for higher than prevailing market prices. \n\nApache&#8217;s U.S. NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser. \n\nU.S. Delivery Commitments The Company has long-term delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil that require Apache to deliver an average of 181 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2023 through 2029, an average of 53 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2030 through 2037, and an average of 5.7 MMbbls of crude oil per year for the period from 2023 through 2025, in each case, at variable, domestic and/or international, market-based pricing. \n\nApache currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves, production from continued development and/or third-party purchases. Apache may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments. The Company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments. \n\nFor more information regarding the Company&#8217;s commitments, please see Part II, Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8212;Contractual Obligations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nInternational \n\nIn 2022, international assets contributed 48 percent of Apache&#8217;s production and 56 percent of its oil and gas revenues. Approximately 33 percent of estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside the U.S. \n\nApache has two international locations with ongoing development and production operations: \n\n&#8226; Egypt, which includes onshore conventional assets located in Egypt&#8217;s Western Desert; and \n\n&#8226; the North Sea, which includes offshore assets based in the U.K. \n\nEgypt Apache has 27 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt&#8217;s Western Desert. At year-end 2022, the Company held 5.3 million gross acres in six separate concessions. The Company&#8217;s acreage is primarily held under one concession agreement that resulted from the ratification of a new merged concession agreement (MCA) with the Egyptian government, as more fully described below. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 1 to 20 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 68 percent of the Company&#8217;s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing Apache with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. \n\nApache&#8217;s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production-sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company&#8217;s PSCs, the Company is the contractor partner (Contractor) with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor&#8217;s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC&#8217;s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and are reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache&#8217;s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache&#8217;s production and reserves. \n\nOn December 27, 2021, the Company announced the ratification of a new MCA with EGPC having an effective date of April 1, 2021. The MCA consolidated 98 percent of gross acreage and 90 percent of gross production under one concession agreement and refreshed the existing development lease terms for 20 years and exploration leases for 5 years. The consolidated concession has a single cost recovery pool to provide improved access to cost recovery, a fixed 40 percent cost recovery limit, and a fixed profit-sharing rate of 30 percent for all Apache production covered under the new concession. \n\nSinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in the Company&#8217;s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business. In conjunction with the ratification of the MCA with EGPC, Apache entered into an agreement with APA under which the historical value of existing concessions prior to ratifying the MCA was retained by Apache, with any excess value from the MCA terms being allocated to APA. In accordance with terms of the agreement, approximately 30 percent of the Company&#8217;s Egyptian operation net income and distributable cash flow, excluding Sinopec&#8217;s one-third interest, was allocated to APA during 2022. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country&#8217;s share of reserves. Apache&#8217;s Egypt assets, including APA and Sinopec&#8217;s noncontrolling interests, contributed 38 percent of 2022 production and 21 percent of 2022 year-end estimated proved reserves. Excluding the impacts of APA and Sinopec&#8217;s noncontrolling interests, Egypt contributed 22 percent of 2022 production and 11 percent of 2022 year-end estimated proved reserves. \n\nIn 2022, the Company drilled 66 gross development and 31 gross exploration wells in Egypt. A key component of the Company&#8217;s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache&#8217;s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. The Company has completed seismic surveys covering three million acres, which has led to recent discoveries that build and enhance the Company&#8217;s drilling inventory in Egypt. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company focused on several environmental initiatives in Egypt and has delivered on its 2022 upstream flaring reduction goal by flaring at least 40 percent less gas than would otherwise be flared without these initiatives, with the Company now compressing this gas into sales lines. \n\nFor 2023, the Company will continue to focus on driving efficiencies and managing costs after increasing activity under the MCA. \n\nNorth Sea Apache has interests in approximately 294,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. These assets contributed 10 percent of Apache&#8217;s 2022 production and approximately 11 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. \n\nApache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in these assets and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4-D seismic. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the Company with additional exploration and development opportunities in the North Sea across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Ness, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field acquired in 2011. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. \n\nDuring 2022, Apache averaged two rigs in the North Sea and drilled one gross development well and one gross exploration well. Production was negatively impacted by considerable planned and unplanned downtime at Beryl and Forties during 2022, improving in the fourth quarter of 2022 following completion of these maintenance activities. \n\nInternational Marketing Apache&#8217;s natural gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices related to the export market . \n\nApache&#8217;s North Sea crude oil production is sold under term, entitlement volume contracts and spot variable volume contracts with a market-based index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement. Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) gas plant, operated by Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited. Natural gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane, butane, and condensate are sold separately on a monthly entitlement basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation. \n\nDrilling Statistics \n\nWorldwide in 2022, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 173 gross wells, with 158 wells (91 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache&#8217;s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, the Company&#8217;s operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to wells completed during 2022, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 89 gross (74.2 net) in the U.S., 41 gross (40.7 net) in Egypt, and 1 gross (0.6 net) in the North Sea. \n\nThe following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Net Exploratory Net Development Total Net Wells &#160; Productive Dry Total Productive Dry Total Productive Dry Total 2022 United States &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 40.7 &#8212; 40.7 40.7 &#8212; 40.7 Egypt 15.0 14.5 29.5 64.4 &#8212; 64.4 79.4 14.5 93.9 North Sea 1.0 &#8212; 1.0 1.0 &#8212; 1.0 2.0 &#8212; 2.0 Total 16.0 14.5 30.5 106.1 &#8212; 106.1 122.1 14.5 136.6 2021 United States &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 67.9 &#8212; 67.9 67.9 &#8212; 67.9 Egypt 10.0 14.0 24.0 28.5 1.0 29.5 38.5 15.0 53.5 North Sea 0.6 0.5 1.1 1.8 0.5 2.3 2.4 1.0 3.4 Total 10.6 14.5 25.1 98.2 1.5 99.7 108.8 16.0 124.8 2020 United States &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 46.3 0.8 47.1 46.3 0.8 47.1 Egypt 17.7 7.0 24.7 35.7 &#8212; 35.7 53.4 7.0 60.4 North Sea 0.6 1.0 1.6 4.2 0.6 4.8 4.8 1.6 6.4 Other International &#8212; 1.5 1.5 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1.5 1.5 Total 18.3 9.5 27.8 86.2 1.4 87.6 104.5 10.9 115.4 ##TABLE_END\n\nProductive Oil and Gas Wells \n\nThe number of productive oil and gas wells, operated and non-operated, in which the Company had an interest as of December 31, 2022, is set forth below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Oil Gas Total &#160; Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net United States 8,716 5,260 881 624 9,597 5,884 Egypt 1,076 1,037 116 113 1,192 1,150 North Sea 159 116 13 8 172 124 Total 9,951 6,413 1,010 745 10,961 7,158 Domestic 8,716 5,260 881 624 9,597 5,884 Foreign 1,235 1,153 129 121 1,364 1,274 Total 9,951 6,413 1,010 745 10,961 7,158 ##TABLE_END\n\nGross natural gas and crude oil wells included 514 wells with multiple completions. \n\nProduction, Pricing, and Lease Operating Cost Data \n\nThe following table describes, for each of the last three fiscal years, oil, NGL, and gas production volumes, average lease operating costs per boe (including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes), and average sales prices for each of the countries where the Company has operations: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Production Average Lease Operating Cost per Boe Average Sales Price Oil NGL Gas Oil NGL Gas Year Ended December 31, (MMbbls) (MMbbls) (Bcf) (Per bbl) (Per bbl) (Per Mcf) 2022 United States 24.1 21.9 167.6 $ 10.96 $ 96.25 $ 33.47 $ 5.33 Egypt (1) \n\n31.1 0.1 130.1 10.37 101.25 76.80 2.85 North Sea (2) \n\n11.9 0.4 12.8 30.07 100.87 67.07 23.36 Total 67.1 22.4 310.5 12.75 99.39 34.62 4.97 2021 United States 27.4 24.2 192.5 $ 8.37 $ 67.37 $ 27.85 $ 3.92 Egypt (1) \n\n25.7 0.2 96.2 11.48 70.33 48.84 2.81 North Sea (2) \n\n13.2 0.4 14.1 26.12 69.67 54.30 12.96 Total 66.3 24.8 302.8 11.31 68.97 28.48 3.99 2020 United States 32.3 27.1 205.6 $ 7.39 $ 37.42 $ 11.21 $ 1.22 Egypt (1) \n\n27.6 0.3 100.4 10.35 39.95 27.83 2.79 North Sea (2) \n\n18.4 0.7 21.0 15.60 42.88 29.73 3.19 Total 78.3 28.1 327.0 9.37 39.60 11.84 1.83 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes production volumes attributable to noncontrolling interests in Egypt. \n\n(2) Sales volumes from the Company&#8217;s North Sea assets for 2022 , 2021, and 2020 were 14.9 MMboe, 16.1 MMboe, and 22.7 MMboe, respectively. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field. \n\nGross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s gross and net acreage position as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Undeveloped Acreage Developed Acreage &#160; Gross Acres Net Acres Gross Acres Net Acres &#160; (In thousands) United States 2,616 1,166 913 561 Egypt 3,589 3,589 1,711 1,661 North Sea 135 118 159 123 Total 6,340 4,873 2,783 2,345 ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apache held 10,000 net undeveloped acres that are scheduled to expire by year-end 2023 if production is not established or the Company takes no action to extend the terms. The Company also held 118,000 and 12,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire by year-end 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments. No oil and gas reserves were recorded on this undeveloped acreage set to expire. \n\nExploration concessions in the Company&#8217;s Egypt asset were extended upon ratification of the new merged concession agreement with the EGPC, and no acreage is scheduled to expire over the next three years. The Company will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 97 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production or owned as undeveloped mineral rights. \n\nEstimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows \n\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the &#8220;economic interest&#8221; method, which excludes the host country&#8217;s share of reserves. \n\nEstimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the &#8220;proved&#8221; classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis, such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods, to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company&#8217;s reserve estimates. \n\nProved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period. \n\nThe following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2022, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. The total column of this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products. \n\n##TABLE_START Oil NGL Gas Total (MMbbls) (MMbbls) (Bcf) (MMboe) Proved Developed: United States 169 153 1,128 510 Egypt (1) \n\n108 &#8212; 400 175 North Sea 83 2 66 96 Total 360 155 1,594 781 Proved Undeveloped: United States 16 16 189 64 Egypt (1) \n\n9 &#8212; 1 9 North Sea 3 &#8212; 2 3 Total 28 16 192 76 Total Proved 388 171 1,786 857 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of 94 MMboe and 5 MMboe, respectively, attributable to noncontrolling interests in Egypt. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of 388 MMbbls of crude oil, 171 MMbbls of NGLs, and 1.8 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of 857 million boe, of which liquids represents approximately 65 percent. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s proved developed reserves totaled 781 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 76 MMboe, or approximately 9 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing. The Company has one field that contains 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company added 34 MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity. There were also upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 75 MMboe. Upward revisions related to miscellaneous changes accounted for 5 MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 70 MMboe, with the new merged concession agreement in Egypt accounting for an increase of 43 MMboe. The North Sea contributed upward revisions of 9 MMboe from well performance and reactivations in both the Beryl and Forties programs. In the United States, the Company experienced positive revisions of 18 MMboe. The Company acquired 1 MMboe of proved reserves and sold 26 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to the Permian Basin. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 19&#8212;Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. \n\nProved Undeveloped Reserves \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total estimated PUD reserves of 76 MMboe as of December 31, 2022, decreased by 9 MMboe from 85 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at year end 2021. During the year, Apache converted 20 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In the U.S., Apache converted 13 MMboe, with the remaining 7 MMboe in its international areas. Apache sold 0.4 MMboe of PUD reserves in the U.S. and did not acquire any PUD reserves during 2022. Apache added 14 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Downward revisions totaled 5 MMboe, comprising 0.5 MMboe associated with engineering and interest revisions, 4 MMboe associated with revised development plans, and 0.5 MMboe associated with product prices. \n\nDuring 2022, a total of approximately $215 million was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves. A portion of Apache&#8217;s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years. During 2022, Apache spent approximately $105 million on PUD reserve development activity in the U.S. and $110 million in the international areas. As of December 31, 2022, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure. \n\nPreparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information \n\nApache&#8217;s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted. \n\nApache&#8217;s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache&#8217;s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache&#8217;s board of directors (the Board of Directors) in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating asset engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable. \n\nApache&#8217;s Executive Vice President of Development is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Company&#8217;s internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry. The Executive Vice President of Development reports directly to the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. \n\nThe estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company&#8217;s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. The Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to conduct a reserves audit, which includes a review of the Company&#8217;s processes and the reasonableness of the Company&#8217;s estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During 2022, the properties selected for each country ranged from 81 to 84 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for 83 percent of the value of Apache&#8217;s international proved reserves and 96 percent of the value of Apache&#8217;s new wells drilled worldwide. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott&#8217;s review. The review covered 80 percent of total proved reserves on a boe basis. \n\nThe percentages of total estimated proved reserves and volumes covered by Ryder Scott&#8217;s reviews for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020 were: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Estimated proved reserves values 82 % 83 % 85 % Estimated proved reserves volumes: United States 80 % 80 % 80 % Egypt 80 % 80 % 82 % North Sea 81 % 81 % 83 % Apache Worldwide 80 % 80 % 81 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company has filed Ryder Scott&#8217;s independent report as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nAccording to Ryder Scott&#8217;s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards. \n\nALTUS MIDSTREAM \n\nIn November 2018, Apache Midstream LLC, one of Apache&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries, completed a transaction with ALTM and its then wholly owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP to create a pure-play, Permian Basin midstream C-corporation anchored by gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. Pursuant to the agreement, Apache&#8217;s subsidiary contributed certain Alpine High midstream assets and options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects to Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries. In exchange for the assets, Apache&#8217;s subsidiary received economic voting and non-economic voting shares in ALTM and limited partner interests in Altus Midstream LP, representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities. As a result, Apache fully consolidated the assets and liabilities of ALTM in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately. \n\nBusiness Combination with BCP \n\nOn February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a previously announced transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP and, together with BCP Raptor Holdco GP, LLC, the Contributed Entities) in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement entered into by and among ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, New BCP Raptor Holdco, LLC (the Contributor), and BCP (the BCP Contribution Agreement). The combination created an integrated midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin offering services for residue gas, NGLs, crude oil and water. Pursuant to the BCP Contribution Agreement, Contributor contributed all of the equity interests of the Contributed Entities (the Contributed Interests) to Altus Midstream LP, with each Contributed Entity becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Altus Midstream LP (the BCP Business Combination). \n\nAs consideration for the contribution of the Contributed Interests, ALTM issued 50 million shares of Class C Common Stock (and Altus Midstream LP issued a corresponding number of common units) to BCP&#8217;s unitholders, which are principally funds affiliated with Blackstone and I Squared Capital. The transaction closed during the first quarter of 2022. Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. \n\nAfter the transaction closed, Apache Midstream LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of APA, which owned approximately 79 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock prior to the BCP Business Combination, owned approximately 20 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Kinetik common stock. Subsequent to the close of the transaction, in March 2022, the Company sold four million of its shares of Kinetik Class A Common Stock for $224 million, reducing the Company&#8217;s retained ownership percentage in Kinetik to approximately 13 percent. Upon closing the transaction, the Company no longer consolidated the assets and liabilities of ALTM in its consolidated financial statements. \n\nMAJOR CUSTOMERS \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. During 2022, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately 15 percent of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During 2021, sales to EGPC and CFE International accounted for approximately 14 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During 2020, sales to EGPC and Vitol accounted for approximately 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. \n\nManagement does not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. \n\nOFFICES \n\nThe Company&#8217;s principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056-4400. As of year-end 2022, the Company maintained offices in Midland, Texas; Houston, Texas; Cairo, Egypt; and Aberdeen, Scotland. Apache&#8217;s primary office space is leased. The current lease on the Company&#8217;s principal executive offices runs through December 31, 2024. The Company plans to move its principal executive offices in 2024 to One Briarlake Plaza in Houston, Texas, under an existing lease that expires on December 31, 2038, subject to the lessee&#8217;s option to extend the term by up to 20 years. For information regarding the Company&#8217;s obligations under its office leases, please see Part II, Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8212;Contractual Obligations and Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nTITLE TO INTERESTS \n\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time the Company acquires properties. The Company believes that its title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in the Company&#8217;s operations. The interests owned by the Company may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY \n\nResponse Plans and Available Resources \n\nApache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed oil spill response plans (the Plans) for their respective offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, which ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities&#8217; operated properties. Emergency preparedness drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans. \n\nApache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any affiliated entity worldwide to access OSRL&#8217;s services. Apache also has a contract for response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world&#8217;s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries. OSRL maintains aircraft available for global dispersant application and has a number of active recovery boom systems that can be used for offshore, nearshore, or shoreline responses. In addition to the services and equipment provided to all members of OSRL, the Company maintains membership to supplementary services from OSRL, including the U.K. Continental Shelf (UKCS) Aerial Surveillance, OSPRAG Capping Stack, and Dispersant Stockpile, providing equipment and services specifically tailored for an emergency response in the North Sea. \n\nIn the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies&#8217; operations in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and to provide spill response capability for its member companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA equipment includes skimming vessels, barges, boom, and dispersants. \n\nCompetitive Conditions \n\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and NGLs. The Company&#8217;s competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than the Company possesses or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry. As a consequence, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights. \n\nHowever, the Company believes its diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, its balanced production mix between oil and gas, its management and incentive systems, and its experienced personnel give it a strong competitive position relative to many of the Company&#8217;s competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. The Company&#8217;s global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which it has producing operations to which it can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. This also reduces the risk that the Company will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country. \n\nEnvironmental Compliance \n\nAs an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, the Company is subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, the Company does not believe that these requirements affect it differently, to any material degree, than other companies in the oil and gas industry. \n\nThe Company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with these requirements, which the Company believes are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. The Company has established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to its operations in all countries in which it does business. The Company has established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of its field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that the Company is unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, the Company does not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on its capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. \n\n##TABLE_START "

RISK FACTORS \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s business activities and the value of its securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of APA&#8217;s securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to the Company&#8217;s securities may be included in the prospectus supplements related to offerings of such securities from time to time in the future. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO PRICING, DEMAND, AND PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND NGLs \n\nGlobal pandemics have previously, may continue to, and may in the future adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations, the global economy, and the demand for and prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. \n\nGlobal pandemics and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, businesses, and consumers, in response to such pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously adversely impacted and may from time to time in the future adversely impact the global economy, resulting in significant volatility in the global financial markets. Previous business closures, restrictions on travel, &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; or &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; orders, and other restrictions on movement within and among communities significantly reduced demand for, and the prices of, oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and such restrictions may be continued or reintroduced at any time. A continued, prolonged period or a renewed period of reduced demand, the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of or reluctance or refusal of individuals to take any vaccines, the failure to develop or reformulate adequate treatments, including due to the emergence of new variants, and other adverse impacts from a pandemic may materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Actual results will depend on future events, which the Company cannot predict, including the scope, duration, and potential reoccurrence of any such pandemic, the emergence and impact of variants, the distribution and effectiveness of, and individual willingness to take, vaccines, therapeutics, and treatments, the demand for, and the prices of, oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and the actions taken by third parties in response to any of the foregoing. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations rely on its workforce having access to its wells, platforms, structures, offices, and facilities. If a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities, whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access, quarantines, illnesses, governmental actions or restrictions (including vaccine mandates and the reactions thereto), or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from a pandemic, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices and their volatility could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices it receives for its sales of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL products. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2022 ranged from a high of $123.64 per barrel to a low of $71.05 per barrel, and the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2022 ranged from a high of $9.85 per MMBtu to a low of $3.46 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including: \n\n&#8226; worldwide and domestic supplies and/or inventories of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs; \n\n&#8226; actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members that participate in OPEC initiatives (OPEC+); \n\n&#8226; political conditions and events (including instabilities, changes in governments, or armed conflicts) in oil and gas producing regions; \n\n&#8226; the occurrence of global events, such as epidemics or pandemics (including, specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic), and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, customers, contractors, and suppliers, in response to such epidemics or pandemics; \n\n&#8226; the price and level of imported foreign or exported domestic crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including as a result of the availability of facilities that process, import, or export such products; \n\n&#8226; increasing inflationary pressure; \n\n&#8226; the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels; \n\n&#8226; increased competitiveness of, and demand for, alternative energy sources; \n\n&#8226; technological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption, including those that alter fuel choices; \n\n&#8226; the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity; \n\n&#8226; weather conditions; \n\n&#8226; the impact of political pressure and the influence of environmental groups and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the industries in which the Company and its affiliates operate, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters; \n\n&#8226; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including legislative, regulatory, and policy changes or initiatives to address the impacts of global climate change, hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring, or water disposal; and \n\n&#8226; the overall economic environment. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s results of operations, as well as the carrying value of its oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Low prices have previously adversely affected and could again adversely affect the Company&#8217;s revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves, and continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s operations and limit its ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, the Company would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs may further adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business as follows: \n\n&#8226; weakening the Company&#8217;s financial condition and reducing its liquidity; \n\n&#8226; limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations; \n\n&#8226; reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that the Company can produce economically; \n\n&#8226; causing the Company to delay or postpone some of its capital projects or reallocate capital to different projects or regions; \n\n&#8226; reducing the Company&#8217;s revenues, operating income, and cash flows; \n\n&#8226; limiting the Company&#8217;s access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt; \n\n&#8226; reducing the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments; or \n\n&#8226; reducing the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s gathering, processing, and transmission facilities, resulting in additional impairments. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs, receive market prices for these commodities, and/or meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints, the inability to procure and resell volumes economically, and various transportation interruptions. \n\nA portion of the Company&#8217;s crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, cyberattacks or terrorist events, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport the Company&#8217;s production. Additionally, the Company may voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of the Company&#8217;s production is interrupted or curtailed at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect the Company&#8217;s cash flows. Further, if the Company is unable to procure and resell third-party volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation, the Company&#8217;s cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has previously not realized, and may in the future not realize, an adequate return on wells that it drills. \n\nDrilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that the Company will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells the Company drills or participates in may not be productive, and the Company may not recover all or any portion of its investment in those wells. Management has previously determined, and may in the future determine, that future or further drilling or development activities will not, or are unlikely to, occur for a well or reservoir based on drilling results, current or future estimated commodity prices or demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, or other information, including drilling results in, or information related to, adjacent or nearby geographic areas or similar geologies or reservoirs. The seismic data and other technologies that the Company uses do not allow it to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering; marine risks, such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes; other adverse weather conditions; and increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment, and labor. \n\nFuture drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, such failure could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Exploration costs and dry hole expenses incurred by the Company during the reporting period are further discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and reflected in the consolidated financial statements included herein. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent it from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose it to other risks. \n\nTo the extent that the Company engages in price risk management activities to protect itself from commodity price declines, the Company may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, the Company&#8217;s hedging arrangements may expose it to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the Company&#8217;s production falls short of the hedged volumes, there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for the Company&#8217;s production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement, the counterparties to the Company&#8217;s hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements, or an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage to or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including well blowouts, explosions, fires, and cratering; pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills; formations with abnormal pressures; equipment malfunctions; hurricanes, major storms, and cyclones, which could affect the Company&#8217;s operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast and the North Sea, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. \n\nFailure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which the Company could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where the Company&#8217;s equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of the Company&#8217;s production is interrupted, containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, the Company&#8217;s cash flows and, in turn, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWeather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s revenues and production. \n\nDemand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price the Company receives for the commodities it produces. In addition, the Company&#8217;s exploration, development, and production activities and equipment have been and can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes \n\nin the Gulf of Mexico, or major storms in the North Sea, which have previously caused and may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. The Company&#8217;s planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s insurance policies do not cover all of the risks the Company faces, which could result in significant financial exposure. \n\nExploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. The Company&#8217;s international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that the Company maintains against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to the Company against all operational risks. \n\nA terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by the Company or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. The Company depends on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with personnel and third-party partners, and conduct many of the Company&#8217;s activities. Unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market the Company&#8217;s production. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems have previously and could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or its customers, suppliers, or others with whom it does business could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage its reputation. \n\nWhile certain of the Company&#8217;s insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events, if the Company were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured, that could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. \n\nWhile the Company has experienced cyberattacks in the past, it has not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In addition, cyberattacks against the Company or others in its industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on its business and operations or the energy industry at large. \n\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects. \n\nThe Company is involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond the Company&#8217;s anticipated completion dates. These projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s large development projects and its ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, the Company&#8217;s estimates of future development costs are based on its current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel the Company will need to implement such projects. The actual future development costs may be significantly higher than the Company currently estimates. If costs become too high, the development projects may become uneconomic to the Company, and it may be forced to abandon such development projects. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO RESERVES AND LEASEHOLD ACREAGE \n\nDiscoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production. \n\nThe production rate from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless the Company adds reserves through exploration and development activities, identifies additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, the Company&#8217;s estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the Company&#8217;s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, as oil or natural gas prices increase, the Company&#8217;s cost for additional reserves could also increase. \n\nThe Company may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. \n\nAlthough the Company performs a review of properties that it acquires, which the Company believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, the Company will focus its review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit the Company as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the Company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the Company&#8217;s operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the Company&#8217;s ongoing operations. \n\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly. \n\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. The Company&#8217;s reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of the Company&#8217;s proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including historical production from the area compared with production from other areas, the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes, future operating costs and capital expenditures, and workover and remediation costs. \n\nFor these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to the Company&#8217;s reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. \n\nAdditionally, because some of the Company&#8217;s reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the Company&#8217;s development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. \n\nA sizeable portion of the Company&#8217;s acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If the leases expire, the Company will lose its right to develop the related properties. The Company&#8217;s drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO COUNTERPARTIES \n\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect the Company. \n\nThe Company is party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of the Company&#8217;s current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to the Company and their willingness to enter into future transactions with the Company. The Company may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. The Company also has exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under the Company&#8217;s policies. In addition, if any lender under the Company&#8217;s credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender&#8217;s commitment under the credit facilities. \n\nThe Company is exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant changes in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty&#8217;s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. The Company is unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty&#8217;s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if the Company does accurately predict sudden changes, its ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company&#8217;s hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that the Company would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to it by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices, the Company&#8217;s hedge receivable positions increase, which increases the Company&#8217;s exposure. If the creditworthiness of the counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, the Company could incur a significant loss. \n\nThe distressed financial conditions of the Company&#8217;s partners and the purchasers of the Company&#8217;s products or assets have had and could have an adverse impact on the Company in the event they are unable to reimburse the Company for their share of costs or to pay the Company for the products or services the Company provides. \n\nConcerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. The Company is exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. The Company sells its crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, the Company pays expenses and bills its non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of recent economic conditions and the previously severe decline in commodity prices, some of the Company&#8217;s customers and non-operating partners experienced severe financial problems that had a significant impact on their creditworthiness. The Company cannot provide assurance that one or more of its financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to the Company or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company&#8217;s customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint have made it and might make it unlikely that the Company will or would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of its transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case. \n\nFrom time to time the Company divests noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, bonds, letters of credit, and similar \n\narrangements. One of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by the Company. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which are collectively referred to as Insolvency Laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, the Company&#8217;s remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not the Company has collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of the Company&#8217;s claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise, pending final resolution of the proceeding. \n\nDespite the provisions in the Company&#8217;s agreements requiring purchasers of its state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, the Company would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require it to perform and hold it responsible for such liabilities and obligations. In such event, the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise. \n\nIf a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s cash flows, operations, or financial condition. \n\nFor additional information regarding Apache&#8217;s prior Gulf of Mexico properties and the bankruptcy of the purchaser of those properties, see the information set forth under &#8220;Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties&#8221; in Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nThe Company does not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements or joint ventures, and the parties to such agreements or ventures may fail to meet their obligations. \n\nThe Company conducts many of its exploration and production (E&#38;P) operations through joint operating agreements or joint ventures with other parties. The Company may not control decisions made under such agreements or ventures, either because it does not have a controlling interest in the venture or is not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that the other parties to these arrangements may have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s, and, therefore, decisions may be made that the Company does not believe are in its best interest. Moreover, parties to such agreements or ventures may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and the Company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of the investment and the Company&#8217;s business and financial condition may be adversely affected. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO CAPITAL MARKETS \n\nA downgrade in the Company&#8217;s credit rating could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital. \n\nThe Company receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact the Company&#8217;s credit ratings include its debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt. During 2022, the Company&#8217;s credit rating was affirmed by Moody&#8217;s as Ba1/Positive and by Standard and Poor&#8217;s as BB+/Positive. Past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, the Company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. \n\nMarket conditions may restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit its financial flexibility. \n\nThe financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. The Company has a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. The Company and/or its partners may need to seek financing to fund these or other future activities. The Company&#8217;s future access to capital, as well as that of its partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of the Company&#8217;s property interests. \n\nAPA Corporation&#8217;s syndicated credit facilities currently mature in April 2027. There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to APA, the Company, or APA&#8217;s other subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders. \n\nActions by advocacy groups to advance climate change and energy transition initiatives, unfavorable ESG ratings, and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of capital from companies in the oil and gas industry, which could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s access to and costs of capital or the market for the Company&#8217;s securities. \n\nOrganizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company, which may cause the market for the Company&#8217;s securities to be negatively impacted. \n\nIn addition, a number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to influence change in the business strategies in oil and gas companies, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities, and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change and energy transition matters, such as promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products and encouraging the divestment of investments in the oil and gas industry, as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with oil and gas companies. If investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in the oil and gas industry, the Company&#8217;s access to and costs of capital or the market for the Company&#8217;s securities may be negatively impacted. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL RESULTS \n\nFuture economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets may materially adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operating results. \n\nCurrent global market conditions and uncertainty, including economic instability in emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on the Company&#8217;s operating results. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for the Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce the Company&#8217;s cash flows from operations and its profitability. \n\nThe Company faces strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&#38;P industry. The Company competes with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than the Company possesses and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry. As a consequence, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of the Company&#8217;s larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. The Company also competes in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change. \n\nAs described in Note 11&#8212;Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income. If the Company were to experience an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change, by value, in the Company&#8217;s equity ownership by five-percent shareholders over a three-year period, the Company&#8217;s \n\nability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to potentially offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Such a limitation could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND POLITICAL RISKS \n\nThe Company may incur significant costs related to environmental matters. \n\nAs an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. The Company&#8217;s efforts to limit its exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to the Company&#8217;s results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require the Company to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s cash flows and its financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. operations are subject to governmental risks. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations. \n\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nWith respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies&#8217; oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM&#8217;s website as &#8220;rescinded,&#8221; if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache&#8217;s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. Additionally, the Company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties&#8217; solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. \n\nNew political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting the Company&#8217;s U.S. operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nProposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the Company&#8217;s operating and capital costs. \n\nSeveral proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. The Company routinely uses fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability. \n\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the Company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S. \n\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nThe U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas E&#38;P companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. The Company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nOn May 26, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a new tax (the Energy Profits Levy) on the profits of oil and gas companies operating in the U.K. and the U.K. Continental Shelf. Under the new law, an additional levy is assessed at a 25 percent rate and is effective for the period of May 26, 2022, through December 31, 2025. On November 17, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Autumn Statement 2022 further changes to the Energy Profits Levy, increasing the levy assessed from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2028. On November 22, 2022, the U.K. Government published draft legislation to implement this change, among other provisions, and on January 10, 2023, the Finance Act 2023 was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. The impact of this tax could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s future financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other changes, the IRA introduced a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) that exceeds $1.0 billion for any three consecutive tax years preceding the tax year at issue. If the Company were to meet this average AFSI test, any resulting Corporate AMT liability could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s future financial results, including earnings and cash flows. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE \n\nThe impacts of energy transition could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to climate change and energy transition. This focus, together with shifting preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy, the use of hydrocarbons, and the use of products manufactured with, or powered by, hydrocarbons, may result in increased availability of, and demand for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric power; technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage, and consumption of alternative energy sources; and development of, and increased demand from consumers and industries for, lower-emission products and services, including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies, as well as more energy-efficient products and services. \n\nThese developments could adversely impact the demand for products powered by or manufactured with hydrocarbons and the demand for the Company&#8217;s, and in turn the prices it receives for its, crude oil, natural gas, and NGL products, which could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and financial performance. \n\nChanges to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nCertain countries where the Company operates, including the U.K., either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on the Company&#8217;s operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where the Company operates, including the U.S., regarding legislation or regulation of GHGs, including to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs and to restrict or eliminate future emissions. Moreover, in January 2021, the \n\nPresident issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. \n\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates, and combustion engine phaseouts. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks related to climate change may result in curtailed refinery activity, increased regulation, or other adverse direct and indirect effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, there is a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. \n\nAny such legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives, if enacted, or additional or increased taxes, assessments, or GHG-related fees on the Company&#8217;s operations could lead to increased operating expenses or cause the Company to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications. \n\nEnhanced focus on ESG matters could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nEnhanced focus on ESG matters related to, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory review, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, increased risk of litigation, and adverse impacts on the Company&#8217;s access to capital. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits the Company requires to conduct its operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to profitably conduct its business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimates used in various scenario planning analyses could differ materially from actual results and could expose the Company to new or additional risks. \n\nIn 2021, the Company undertook a scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board&#8217;s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This expanded climate-focused scenario planning framework included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets, as well as changes in government regulations and policy. Given the dynamic nature of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company generally performs annual scenario analyses with five-year time horizons. When analyzing longer-term TCFD scenarios, the Company relies on external analysis for demand scenarios, carbon pricing, and comparison-pricing scenarios, which are then compared to the Company&#8217;s internally prepared base-case pricing analysis averaged out to 2040. Given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios, the Company&#8217;s estimates could differ materially from actual results. Additionally, by electing to set and share publicly these metrics in the Company&#8217;s sustainability report and the Company&#8217;s commitment to expand upon its disclosures, the Company&#8217;s business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives. As a result, the Company could damage its reputation if it fails to act responsibly in the areas in which it reports. Any harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation resulting from setting these metrics, expanding its disclosures, or its failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial performance, and growth. \n\nThe Company operates in Gulf Coast wetlands, which face threats from climate change and human activities. \n\nA changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial, to the areas in which the Company operates, including Gulf Coast wetlands. For several decades, the State of Louisiana has lost an estimated 20 square miles of wetlands per year, due to natural processes of subsidence, saltwater intrusion, and shoreline erosion, as well as human activities, such as levee construction along the Mississippi River and the dredging of navigation canals. A possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and major flooding events. The risk of increased or more severe hurricanes or flooding events along or near the Gulf Coast could increase the Company&#8217;s costs to repair damaged facilities and restore production. Additionally, federal, state, and local laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations, including: (i) the limitation or prohibition of certain activities on wetlands; (ii) the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; (iii) the reporting of the types and quantities of various substances that are generated, stored, processed, or released in connection with protected properties; and \n\n(iv) the installation of costly emission monitoring and/or pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of the Company&#8217;s operations. In addition, the Company may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt the Company&#8217;s operations or specific projects and limit its growth and revenue. \n\nThe guidance upon which the Company&#8217;s consumptive water use reporting was modified and could be revised in the future, resulting in the over or underreporting of the Company&#8217;s consumptive water use, and could expose the Company to financial risk. \n\nBased on Ipieca&#8217;s Sustainability Reporting Guidance of the Oil and Gas Industry (2020), the Company modified the way it reports its water data compared to previous years and also restated data from past years. Previously, the Company included produced water usage in its consumptive use calculations, which led to an over-reporting of consumptive water use. Based on re-evaluation of water reporting definitions and guidance, the Company determined that produced water &#8211; non-potable water released from deep underground formations and brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production &#8211; should not be classified as consumed in the same sense as fresh water. Produced water is generally not of the quality that most users would be able to utilize and is therefore not available for third-party usage outside of the oilfield. The Company&#8217;s revised reporting now reflects only fresh water and non-potable water from surface water or shallow groundwater that are consumed in oil and gas operations. \n\nThe treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted and could expose the Company to additional costs or limit certain operations. \n\nThe treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. The Company&#8217;s ability to accurately report and track its water use is necessary for its continued ability to reuse and recycle water, when possible. While the Company remains focused on reusing or recycling water over disposal of water, the Company&#8217;s costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly if reusing and recycling water becomes impractical. Further, compliance with reporting and environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage, use, and discharge of water may increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial conditions. \n\nIn response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has been developing data associated with seismic activity, particularly such activity related to injection wells used for produced water disposal. In September 2021, the RRC began to limit saltwater disposal in the Midland Basin under what is known as a Seismic Response Action (or SAR) due to increased seismic activity. \n\nAmong other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the state to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. States may issue orders to temporarily shut down or to curtail the injection depth of existing wells in the vicinity of seismic events. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation to limit or prohibit oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. These developments could result in restriction of disposal wells that could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s capital expenses and operating costs or limit production in certain areas. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS \n\nInternational operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations outside the U.S. are based primarily in Egypt and the U.K. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 47 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 production was outside the U.S., and approximately 32 percent of the Company&#8217;s estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, were located outside the U.S. As a result, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#8226; general strikes and civil unrest; \n\n&#8226; the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, including through prospective or retroactive changes in the laws and regulations applicable to such contracts; \n\n&#8226; import and export regulations; \n\n&#8226; taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions; \n\n&#8226; price control; \n\n&#8226; transportation regulations and tariffs; \n\n&#8226; constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area; \n\n&#8226; exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds; \n\n&#8226; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions; \n\n&#8226; the long-term effects of the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the British pound; \n\n&#8226; the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where the Company currently operates; \n\n&#8226; the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S.; and \n\n&#8226; difficulties in enforcing the Company&#8217;s rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations. \n\nForeign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to the Company by another country, the Company&#8217;s interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even the Company&#8217;s smaller international assets may affect its overall business and results of operations by distracting management&#8217;s attention from its more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which the Company operates have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as the Company&#8217;s. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of the Company&#8217;s assets. This could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s interests and its future profitability. \n\nThe impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which the Company operates, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on the Company&#8217;s operations in particular is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. The Company may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard its assets against terrorist activities. \n\nA deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nDeterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of the Company&#8217;s assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of the Company&#8217;s existing contracts with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company&#8217;s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of noncontrolling interests, contributed 22 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 production and accounted for 11 percent of the Company&#8217;s year-end estimated proved reserves and 22 percent of the Company&#8217;s estimated discounted future net cash flows. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. The Company&#8217;s financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign \n\ncurrency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. \n\n##TABLE_START "

BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END\n\nGENERAL \n\nApache Corporation, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation (APA), is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs. The Company&#8217;s upstream business currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, the Company&#8217;s midstream business was operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owned, developed, and operated a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas. \n\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company consummated a holding company reorganization (the Holding Company Reorganization), pursuant to which the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA, and all of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of APA. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, APA became the successor issuer to the Company pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act and replaced the Company as the public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;APA.&#8221; The Holding Company Reorganization modernized APA&#8217;s operating and legal structure to more closely align with its growing international presence, making it more consistent with other companies that have affiliates operating around the globe. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail. \n\nThrough APA&#8217;s website, www.apacorp.com , you can access, free of charge, electronic copies of the documents the Company files with the SEC, including the Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to these reports.

Additional data and discussion are provided in Part II, Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n##TABLE_START Production Percentage of Total Production Production Revenue Year-End Estimated Proved Reserves Percentage of Total Estimated Proved Reserves Gross Wells Drilled Gross Productive Wells Drilled (In MMboe) (In millions) (In MMboe) United States 73.9 52 % $ 3,949 573 67 % 74 74 \n\nEgypt (1) \n\n52.8 38 % 3,521 184 21 % 97 82 \n\nNorth Sea (2) \n\n14.4 10 % 1,558 99 12 % 2 2 Total 141.1 100 % $ 9,028 856 100 % 173 158 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Apache&#8217;s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of noncontrolling interests contributed 22 percent of 2022 production and accounted for 11 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. \n\n(2) Sales volumes from the Company&#8217;s North Sea assets for 2022 were 14.9 MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field. \n\nUnited States \n\nIn 2022, Apache&#8217;s U.S. upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately 52 percent of production, 44 percent of oil and gas revenues, and 67 percent of estimated year-end proved reserves, consistent with prior years. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 3.5 million gross acres (1.7 million net acres) in the U.S., 74 percent of which are undeveloped. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. assets are primarily located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, including the Permian sub-basins: Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays being developed within these sub-basins include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry. Apache is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, operating approximately 6,000 gross oil and gas wells across its acreage, with additional interests in more than 3,000 non-operated wells. Of note, approximately six percent of the Company&#8217;s net acreage position in the Permian Basin is on federal onshore lands. Apache also has operations located in the Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk areas of Southeast Texas, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and along the Gulf Coast in South Texas and Louisiana. \n\nHighlights of the Company&#8217;s operations in the U.S. include: \n\n&#8226; Southern Midland Basin Apache holds approximately 789,000 gross acres (451,000 net acres) in the Southern Midland Basin and the Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk areas of southeast Texas. During 2022, the Company averaged two rigs targeting oil plays in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations, drilling 52 gross development wells in this basin with a 100 percent success rate. \n\n&#8226; Delaware Basin Apache holds approximately 223,000 gross acres (127,000 net acres) in the Delaware Basin, including opportunities in the Bone Spring and other formations of Eastern New Mexico and bordering West Texas, and the Alpine High play in the southern portion of the Permian Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas. During 2022, the Company completed 22 gross development wells with a 100 percent success rate. \n\n&#8226; Legacy Assets Apache holds approximately 2.5 million gross acres (1.1 million net acres) in legacy properties, of which 663,000 gross acres are in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Consistent with the Company&#8217;s broader portfolio management efforts, certain non-strategic leasehold positions on its legacy acreage holdings provide additional monetization opportunities that continue to be evaluated. \n\n&#8226; New Venture Assets Apache separately has undeveloped acreage positions across several states where it intends to pursue exploration interests and potential development opportunities over time. \n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining a safe, steady, and efficient level of activity as part of its three-year capital investment program. For 2023, the Company will continue to budget its capital program at levels to fund activity necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Future rig activity levels and drilling targets will be dependent on the success of the Company&#8217;s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically. \n\nU.S. Marketing The Company sells its U.S. natural gas production at liquid index sales points within the U.S., at either monthly or daily index-based prices. In addition, to satisfy a delivery commitment beginning in 2023, the Company will purchase third party natural gas to sell and deliver to a U.S. LNG export facility. The tenor of the Company&#8217;s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies, as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk. \n\nApache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil production to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing indices (e.g. WTI Houston, West Texas Sour (WTS), WTI Midland, or West Texas Light (WTL) Midland) and some predominately Brent related international pricing indices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential. Apache&#8217;s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide an opportunity for higher than prevailing market prices. \n\nApache&#8217;s U.S. NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser. \n\nU.S. Delivery Commitments The Company has long-term delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil that require Apache to deliver an average of 181 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2023 through 2029, an average of 53 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2030 through 2037, and an average of 5.7 MMbbls of crude oil per year for the period from 2023 through 2025, in each case, at variable, domestic and/or international, market-based pricing. \n\nApache currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves, production from continued development and/or third-party purchases. Apache may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments. The Company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments. \n\nFor more information regarding the Company&#8217;s commitments, please see Part II, Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8212;Contractual Obligations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nInternational \n\nIn 2022, international assets contributed 48 percent of Apache&#8217;s production and 56 percent of its oil and gas revenues. Approximately 33 percent of estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside the U.S. \n\nApache has two international locations with ongoing development and production operations: \n\n&#8226; Egypt, which includes onshore conventional assets located in Egypt&#8217;s Western Desert; and \n\n&#8226; the North Sea, which includes offshore assets based in the U.K. \n\nEgypt Apache has 27 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt&#8217;s Western Desert. At year-end 2022, the Company held 5.3 million gross acres in six separate concessions. The Company&#8217;s acreage is primarily held under one concession agreement that resulted from the ratification of a new merged concession agreement (MCA) with the Egyptian government, as more fully described below. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 1 to 20 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 68 percent of the Company&#8217;s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing Apache with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. \n\nApache&#8217;s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production-sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company&#8217;s PSCs, the Company is the contractor partner (Contractor) with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor&#8217;s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC&#8217;s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and are reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache&#8217;s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache&#8217;s production and reserves. \n\nOn December 27, 2021, the Company announced the ratification of a new MCA with EGPC having an effective date of April 1, 2021. The MCA consolidated 98 percent of gross acreage and 90 percent of gross production under one concession agreement and refreshed the existing development lease terms for 20 years and exploration leases for 5 years. The consolidated concession has a single cost recovery pool to provide improved access to cost recovery, a fixed 40 percent cost recovery limit, and a fixed profit-sharing rate of 30 percent for all Apache production covered under the new concession. \n\nSinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in the Company&#8217;s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business. In conjunction with the ratification of the MCA with EGPC, Apache entered into an agreement with APA under which the historical value of existing concessions prior to ratifying the MCA was retained by Apache, with any excess value from the MCA terms being allocated to APA. In accordance with terms of the agreement, approximately 30 percent of the Company&#8217;s Egyptian operation net income and distributable cash flow, excluding Sinopec&#8217;s one-third interest, was allocated to APA during 2022. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country&#8217;s share of reserves. Apache&#8217;s Egypt assets, including APA and Sinopec&#8217;s noncontrolling interests, contributed 38 percent of 2022 production and 21 percent of 2022 year-end estimated proved reserves. Excluding the impacts of APA and Sinopec&#8217;s noncontrolling interests, Egypt contributed 22 percent of 2022 production and 11 percent of 2022 year-end estimated proved reserves. \n\nIn 2022, the Company drilled 66 gross development and 31 gross exploration wells in Egypt. A key component of the Company&#8217;s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache&#8217;s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. The Company has completed seismic surveys covering three million acres, which has led to recent discoveries that build and enhance the Company&#8217;s drilling inventory in Egypt. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company focused on several environmental initiatives in Egypt and has delivered on its 2022 upstream flaring reduction goal by flaring at least 40 percent less gas than would otherwise be flared without these initiatives, with the Company now compressing this gas into sales lines. \n\nFor 2023, the Company will continue to focus on driving efficiencies and managing costs after increasing activity under the MCA. \n\nNorth Sea Apache has interests in approximately 294,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. These assets contributed 10 percent of Apache&#8217;s 2022 production and approximately 11 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. \n\nApache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in these assets and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4-D seismic. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the Company with additional exploration and development opportunities in the North Sea across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Ness, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field acquired in 2011. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. \n\nDuring 2022, Apache averaged two rigs in the North Sea and drilled one gross development well and one gross exploration well. Production was negatively impacted by considerable planned and unplanned downtime at Beryl and Forties during 2022, improving in the fourth quarter of 2022 following completion of these maintenance activities. \n\nInternational Marketing Apache&#8217;s natural gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices related to the export market . \n\nApache&#8217;s North Sea crude oil production is sold under term, entitlement volume contracts and spot variable volume contracts with a market-based index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement. Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) gas plant, operated by Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited. Natural gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane, butane, and condensate are sold separately on a monthly entitlement basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation. \n\nDrilling Statistics \n\nWorldwide in 2022, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 173 gross wells, with 158 wells (91 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache&#8217;s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, the Company&#8217;s operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to wells completed during 2022, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 89 gross (74.2 net) in the U.S., 41 gross (40.7 net) in Egypt, and 1 gross (0.6 net) in the North Sea. \n\nThe following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Net Exploratory Net Development Total Net Wells &#160; Productive Dry Total Productive Dry Total Productive Dry Total 2022 United States &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 40.7 &#8212; 40.7 40.7 &#8212; 40.7 Egypt 15.0 14.5 29.5 64.4 &#8212; 64.4 79.4 14.5 93.9 North Sea 1.0 &#8212; 1.0 1.0 &#8212; 1.0 2.0 &#8212; 2.0 Total 16.0 14.5 30.5 106.1 &#8212; 106.1 122.1 14.5 136.6 2021 United States &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 67.9 &#8212; 67.9 67.9 &#8212; 67.9 Egypt 10.0 14.0 24.0 28.5 1.0 29.5 38.5 15.0 53.5 North Sea 0.6 0.5 1.1 1.8 0.5 2.3 2.4 1.0 3.4 Total 10.6 14.5 25.1 98.2 1.5 99.7 108.8 16.0 124.8 2020 United States &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 46.3 0.8 47.1 46.3 0.8 47.1 Egypt 17.7 7.0 24.7 35.7 &#8212; 35.7 53.4 7.0 60.4 North Sea 0.6 1.0 1.6 4.2 0.6 4.8 4.8 1.6 6.4 Other International &#8212; 1.5 1.5 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 1.5 1.5 Total 18.3 9.5 27.8 86.2 1.4 87.6 104.5 10.9 115.4 ##TABLE_END\n\nProductive Oil and Gas Wells \n\nThe number of productive oil and gas wells, operated and non-operated, in which the Company had an interest as of December 31, 2022, is set forth below: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Oil Gas Total &#160; Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net United States 8,716 5,260 881 624 9,597 5,884 Egypt 1,076 1,037 116 113 1,192 1,150 North Sea 159 116 13 8 172 124 Total 9,951 6,413 1,010 745 10,961 7,158 Domestic 8,716 5,260 881 624 9,597 5,884 Foreign 1,235 1,153 129 121 1,364 1,274 Total 9,951 6,413 1,010 745 10,961 7,158 ##TABLE_END\n\nGross natural gas and crude oil wells included 514 wells with multiple completions. \n\nProduction, Pricing, and Lease Operating Cost Data \n\nThe following table describes, for each of the last three fiscal years, oil, NGL, and gas production volumes, average lease operating costs per boe (including transportation costs but excluding severance and other taxes), and average sales prices for each of the countries where the Company has operations: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Production Average Lease Operating Cost per Boe Average Sales Price Oil NGL Gas Oil NGL Gas Year Ended December 31, (MMbbls) (MMbbls) (Bcf) (Per bbl) (Per bbl) (Per Mcf) 2022 United States 24.1 21.9 167.6 $ 10.96 $ 96.25 $ 33.47 $ 5.33 Egypt (1) \n\n31.1 0.1 130.1 10.37 101.25 76.80 2.85 North Sea (2) \n\n11.9 0.4 12.8 30.07 100.87 67.07 23.36 Total 67.1 22.4 310.5 12.75 99.39 34.62 4.97 2021 United States 27.4 24.2 192.5 $ 8.37 $ 67.37 $ 27.85 $ 3.92 Egypt (1) \n\n25.7 0.2 96.2 11.48 70.33 48.84 2.81 North Sea (2) \n\n13.2 0.4 14.1 26.12 69.67 54.30 12.96 Total 66.3 24.8 302.8 11.31 68.97 28.48 3.99 2020 United States 32.3 27.1 205.6 $ 7.39 $ 37.42 $ 11.21 $ 1.22 Egypt (1) \n\n27.6 0.3 100.4 10.35 39.95 27.83 2.79 North Sea (2) \n\n18.4 0.7 21.0 15.60 42.88 29.73 3.19 Total 78.3 28.1 327.0 9.37 39.60 11.84 1.83 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes production volumes attributable to noncontrolling interests in Egypt. \n\n(2) Sales volumes from the Company&#8217;s North Sea assets for 2022 , 2021, and 2020 were 14.9 MMboe, 16.1 MMboe, and 22.7 MMboe, respectively. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field. \n\nGross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage \n\nThe following table summarizes the Company&#8217;s gross and net acreage position as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Undeveloped Acreage Developed Acreage &#160; Gross Acres Net Acres Gross Acres Net Acres &#160; (In thousands) United States 2,616 1,166 913 561 Egypt 3,589 3,589 1,711 1,661 North Sea 135 118 159 123 Total 6,340 4,873 2,783 2,345 ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apache held 10,000 net undeveloped acres that are scheduled to expire by year-end 2023 if production is not established or the Company takes no action to extend the terms. The Company also held 118,000 and 12,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire by year-end 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments. No oil and gas reserves were recorded on this undeveloped acreage set to expire. \n\nExploration concessions in the Company&#8217;s Egypt asset were extended upon ratification of the new merged concession agreement with the EGPC, and no acreage is scheduled to expire over the next three years. The Company will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 97 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production or owned as undeveloped mineral rights. \n\nEstimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows \n\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the &#8220;economic interest&#8221; method, which excludes the host country&#8217;s share of reserves. \n\nEstimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the &#8220;proved&#8221; classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis, such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods, to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company&#8217;s reserve estimates. \n\nProved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period. \n\nThe following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2022, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. The total column of this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products. \n\n##TABLE_START Oil NGL Gas Total (MMbbls) (MMbbls) (Bcf) (MMboe) Proved Developed: United States 169 153 1,128 510 Egypt (1) \n\n108 &#8212; 400 175 North Sea 83 2 66 96 Total 360 155 1,594 781 Proved Undeveloped: United States 16 16 189 64 Egypt (1) \n\n9 &#8212; 1 9 North Sea 3 &#8212; 2 3 Total 28 16 192 76 Total Proved 388 171 1,786 857 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of 94 MMboe and 5 MMboe, respectively, attributable to noncontrolling interests in Egypt. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of 388 MMbbls of crude oil, 171 MMbbls of NGLs, and 1.8 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of 857 million boe, of which liquids represents approximately 65 percent. As of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s proved developed reserves totaled 781 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 76 MMboe, or approximately 9 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing. The Company has one field that contains 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company added 34 MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity. There were also upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 75 MMboe. Upward revisions related to miscellaneous changes accounted for 5 MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 70 MMboe, with the new merged concession agreement in Egypt accounting for an increase of 43 MMboe. The North Sea contributed upward revisions of 9 MMboe from well performance and reactivations in both the Beryl and Forties programs. In the United States, the Company experienced positive revisions of 18 MMboe. The Company acquired 1 MMboe of proved reserves and sold 26 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to the Permian Basin. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 19&#8212;Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. \n\nProved Undeveloped Reserves \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total estimated PUD reserves of 76 MMboe as of December 31, 2022, decreased by 9 MMboe from 85 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at year end 2021. During the year, Apache converted 20 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In the U.S., Apache converted 13 MMboe, with the remaining 7 MMboe in its international areas. Apache sold 0.4 MMboe of PUD reserves in the U.S. and did not acquire any PUD reserves during 2022. Apache added 14 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Downward revisions totaled 5 MMboe, comprising 0.5 MMboe associated with engineering and interest revisions, 4 MMboe associated with revised development plans, and 0.5 MMboe associated with product prices. \n\nDuring 2022, a total of approximately $215 million was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves. A portion of Apache&#8217;s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years. During 2022, Apache spent approximately $105 million on PUD reserve development activity in the U.S. and $110 million in the international areas. As of December 31, 2022, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure. \n\nPreparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information \n\nApache&#8217;s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted. \n\nApache&#8217;s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache&#8217;s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache&#8217;s board of directors (the Board of Directors) in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating asset engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable. \n\nApache&#8217;s Executive Vice President of Development is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Company&#8217;s internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry. The Executive Vice President of Development reports directly to the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. \n\nThe estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company&#8217;s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. The Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to conduct a reserves audit, which includes a review of the Company&#8217;s processes and the reasonableness of the Company&#8217;s estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During 2022, the properties selected for each country ranged from 81 to 84 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for 83 percent of the value of Apache&#8217;s international proved reserves and 96 percent of the value of Apache&#8217;s new wells drilled worldwide. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott&#8217;s review. The review covered 80 percent of total proved reserves on a boe basis. \n\nThe percentages of total estimated proved reserves and volumes covered by Ryder Scott&#8217;s reviews for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020 were: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Estimated proved reserves values 82 % 83 % 85 % Estimated proved reserves volumes: United States 80 % 80 % 80 % Egypt 80 % 80 % 82 % North Sea 81 % 81 % 83 % Apache Worldwide 80 % 80 % 81 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company has filed Ryder Scott&#8217;s independent report as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nAccording to Ryder Scott&#8217;s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards. \n\nALTUS MIDSTREAM \n\nIn November 2018, Apache Midstream LLC, one of Apache&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries, completed a transaction with ALTM and its then wholly owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP to create a pure-play, Permian Basin midstream C-corporation anchored by gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. Pursuant to the agreement, Apache&#8217;s subsidiary contributed certain Alpine High midstream assets and options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects to Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries. In exchange for the assets, Apache&#8217;s subsidiary received economic voting and non-economic voting shares in ALTM and limited partner interests in Altus Midstream LP, representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities. As a result, Apache fully consolidated the assets and liabilities of ALTM in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately. \n\nBusiness Combination with BCP \n\nOn February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a previously announced transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP and, together with BCP Raptor Holdco GP, LLC, the Contributed Entities) in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement entered into by and among ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, New BCP Raptor Holdco, LLC (the Contributor), and BCP (the BCP Contribution Agreement). The combination created an integrated midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin offering services for residue gas, NGLs, crude oil and water. Pursuant to the BCP Contribution Agreement, Contributor contributed all of the equity interests of the Contributed Entities (the Contributed Interests) to Altus Midstream LP, with each Contributed Entity becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Altus Midstream LP (the BCP Business Combination). \n\nAs consideration for the contribution of the Contributed Interests, ALTM issued 50 million shares of Class C Common Stock (and Altus Midstream LP issued a corresponding number of common units) to BCP&#8217;s unitholders, which are principally funds affiliated with Blackstone and I Squared Capital. The transaction closed during the first quarter of 2022. Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. \n\nAfter the transaction closed, Apache Midstream LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of APA, which owned approximately 79 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock prior to the BCP Business Combination, owned approximately 20 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Kinetik common stock. Subsequent to the close of the transaction, in March 2022, the Company sold four million of its shares of Kinetik Class A Common Stock for $224 million, reducing the Company&#8217;s retained ownership percentage in Kinetik to approximately 13 percent. Upon closing the transaction, the Company no longer consolidated the assets and liabilities of ALTM in its consolidated financial statements. \n\nMAJOR CUSTOMERS \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. During 2022, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately 15 percent of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During 2021, sales to EGPC and CFE International accounted for approximately 14 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During 2020, sales to EGPC and Vitol accounted for approximately 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. \n\nManagement does not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. \n\nOFFICES \n\nThe Company&#8217;s principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056-4400. As of year-end 2022, the Company maintained offices in Midland, Texas; Houston, Texas; Cairo, Egypt; and Aberdeen, Scotland. Apache&#8217;s primary office space is leased. The current lease on the Company&#8217;s principal executive offices runs through December 31, 2024. The Company plans to move its principal executive offices in 2024 to One Briarlake Plaza in Houston, Texas, under an existing lease that expires on December 31, 2038, subject to the lessee&#8217;s option to extend the term by up to 20 years. For information regarding the Company&#8217;s obligations under its office leases, please see Part II, Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8212;Contractual Obligations and Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nTITLE TO INTERESTS \n\nAs is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time the Company acquires properties. The Company believes that its title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in the Company&#8217;s operations. The interests owned by the Company may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY \n\nResponse Plans and Available Resources \n\nApache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed oil spill response plans (the Plans) for their respective offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, which ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities&#8217; operated properties. Emergency preparedness drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans. \n\nApache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any affiliated entity worldwide to access OSRL&#8217;s services. Apache also has a contract for response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world&#8217;s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries. OSRL maintains aircraft available for global dispersant application and has a number of active recovery boom systems that can be used for offshore, nearshore, or shoreline responses. In addition to the services and equipment provided to all members of OSRL, the Company maintains membership to supplementary services from OSRL, including the U.K. Continental Shelf (UKCS) Aerial Surveillance, OSPRAG Capping Stack, and Dispersant Stockpile, providing equipment and services specifically tailored for an emergency response in the North Sea. \n\nIn the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies&#8217; operations in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and to provide spill response capability for its member companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA equipment includes skimming vessels, barges, boom, and dispersants. \n\nCompetitive Conditions \n\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and NGLs. The Company&#8217;s competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than the Company possesses or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry. As a consequence, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights. \n\nHowever, the Company believes its diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, its balanced production mix between oil and gas, its management and incentive systems, and its experienced personnel give it a strong competitive position relative to many of the Company&#8217;s competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. The Company&#8217;s global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which it has producing operations to which it can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. This also reduces the risk that the Company will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country. \n\nEnvironmental Compliance \n\nAs an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, the Company is subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, the Company does not believe that these requirements affect it differently, to any material degree, than other companies in the oil and gas industry. \n\nThe Company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with these requirements, which the Company believes are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. The Company has established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to its operations in all countries in which it does business. The Company has established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of its field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that the Company is unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, the Company does not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on its capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. \n\n##TABLE_START ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s business activities and the value of its securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of APA&#8217;s securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to the Company&#8217;s securities may be included in the prospectus supplements related to offerings of such securities from time to time in the future. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO PRICING, DEMAND, AND PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND NGLs \n\nGlobal pandemics have previously, may continue to, and may in the future adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations, the global economy, and the demand for and prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. \n\nGlobal pandemics and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, businesses, and consumers, in response to such pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously adversely impacted and may from time to time in the future adversely impact the global economy, resulting in significant volatility in the global financial markets. Previous business closures, restrictions on travel, &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; or &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; orders, and other restrictions on movement within and among communities significantly reduced demand for, and the prices of, oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and such restrictions may be continued or reintroduced at any time. A continued, prolonged period or a renewed period of reduced demand, the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of or reluctance or refusal of individuals to take any vaccines, the failure to develop or reformulate adequate treatments, including due to the emergence of new variants, and other adverse impacts from a pandemic may materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Actual results will depend on future events, which the Company cannot predict, including the scope, duration, and potential reoccurrence of any such pandemic, the emergence and impact of variants, the distribution and effectiveness of, and individual willingness to take, vaccines, therapeutics, and treatments, the demand for, and the prices of, oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and the actions taken by third parties in response to any of the foregoing. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations rely on its workforce having access to its wells, platforms, structures, offices, and facilities. If a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities, whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access, quarantines, illnesses, governmental actions or restrictions (including vaccine mandates and the reactions thereto), or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from a pandemic, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices and their volatility could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices it receives for its sales of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL products. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2022 ranged from a high of $123.64 per barrel to a low of $71.05 per barrel, and the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2022 ranged from a high of $9.85 per MMBtu to a low of $3.46 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including: \n\n&#8226; worldwide and domestic supplies and/or inventories of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs; \n\n&#8226; actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members that participate in OPEC initiatives (OPEC+); \n\n&#8226; political conditions and events (including instabilities, changes in governments, or armed conflicts) in oil and gas producing regions; \n\n&#8226; the occurrence of global events, such as epidemics or pandemics (including, specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic), and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, customers, contractors, and suppliers, in response to such epidemics or pandemics; \n\n&#8226; the price and level of imported foreign or exported domestic crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including as a result of the availability of facilities that process, import, or export such products; \n\n&#8226; increasing inflationary pressure; \n\n&#8226; the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels; \n\n&#8226; increased competitiveness of, and demand for, alternative energy sources; \n\n&#8226; technological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption, including those that alter fuel choices; \n\n&#8226; the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity; \n\n&#8226; weather conditions; \n\n&#8226; the impact of political pressure and the influence of environmental groups and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the industries in which the Company and its affiliates operate, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters; \n\n&#8226; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including legislative, regulatory, and policy changes or initiatives to address the impacts of global climate change, hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring, or water disposal; and \n\n&#8226; the overall economic environment. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s results of operations, as well as the carrying value of its oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Low prices have previously adversely affected and could again adversely affect the Company&#8217;s revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves, and continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s operations and limit its ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, the Company would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs may further adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business as follows: \n\n&#8226; weakening the Company&#8217;s financial condition and reducing its liquidity; \n\n&#8226; limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations; \n\n&#8226; reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that the Company can produce economically; \n\n&#8226; causing the Company to delay or postpone some of its capital projects or reallocate capital to different projects or regions; \n\n&#8226; reducing the Company&#8217;s revenues, operating income, and cash flows; \n\n&#8226; limiting the Company&#8217;s access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt; \n\n&#8226; reducing the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments; or \n\n&#8226; reducing the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s gathering, processing, and transmission facilities, resulting in additional impairments. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs, receive market prices for these commodities, and/or meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints, the inability to procure and resell volumes economically, and various transportation interruptions. \n\nA portion of the Company&#8217;s crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, cyberattacks or terrorist events, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport the Company&#8217;s production. Additionally, the Company may voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of the Company&#8217;s production is interrupted or curtailed at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect the Company&#8217;s cash flows. Further, if the Company is unable to procure and resell third-party volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation, the Company&#8217;s cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has previously not realized, and may in the future not realize, an adequate return on wells that it drills. \n\nDrilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that the Company will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells the Company drills or participates in may not be productive, and the Company may not recover all or any portion of its investment in those wells. Management has previously determined, and may in the future determine, that future or further drilling or development activities will not, or are unlikely to, occur for a well or reservoir based on drilling results, current or future estimated commodity prices or demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, or other information, including drilling results in, or information related to, adjacent or nearby geographic areas or similar geologies or reservoirs. The seismic data and other technologies that the Company uses do not allow it to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering; marine risks, such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes; other adverse weather conditions; and increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment, and labor. \n\nFuture drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, such failure could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Exploration costs and dry hole expenses incurred by the Company during the reporting period are further discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and reflected in the consolidated financial statements included herein. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent it from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose it to other risks. \n\nTo the extent that the Company engages in price risk management activities to protect itself from commodity price declines, the Company may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, the Company&#8217;s hedging arrangements may expose it to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the Company&#8217;s production falls short of the hedged volumes, there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for the Company&#8217;s production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement, the counterparties to the Company&#8217;s hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements, or an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage to or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including well blowouts, explosions, fires, and cratering; pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills; formations with abnormal pressures; equipment malfunctions; hurricanes, major storms, and cyclones, which could affect the Company&#8217;s operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast and the North Sea, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. \n\nFailure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which the Company could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where the Company&#8217;s equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of the Company&#8217;s production is interrupted, containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, the Company&#8217;s cash flows and, in turn, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nWeather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s revenues and production. \n\nDemand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price the Company receives for the commodities it produces. In addition, the Company&#8217;s exploration, development, and production activities and equipment have been and can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes \n\nin the Gulf of Mexico, or major storms in the North Sea, which have previously caused and may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. The Company&#8217;s planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s insurance policies do not cover all of the risks the Company faces, which could result in significant financial exposure. \n\nExploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. The Company&#8217;s international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that the Company maintains against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to the Company against all operational risks. \n\nA terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by the Company or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. The Company depends on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with personnel and third-party partners, and conduct many of the Company&#8217;s activities. Unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market the Company&#8217;s production. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems have previously and could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or its customers, suppliers, or others with whom it does business could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage its reputation. \n\nWhile certain of the Company&#8217;s insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events, if the Company were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured, that could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. \n\nWhile the Company has experienced cyberattacks in the past, it has not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In addition, cyberattacks against the Company or others in its industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on its business and operations or the energy industry at large. \n\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects. \n\nThe Company is involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond the Company&#8217;s anticipated completion dates. These projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s large development projects and its ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, the Company&#8217;s estimates of future development costs are based on its current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel the Company will need to implement such projects. The actual future development costs may be significantly higher than the Company currently estimates. If costs become too high, the development projects may become uneconomic to the Company, and it may be forced to abandon such development projects. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO RESERVES AND LEASEHOLD ACREAGE \n\nDiscoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production. \n\nThe production rate from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless the Company adds reserves through exploration and development activities, identifies additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, the Company&#8217;s estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the Company&#8217;s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, as oil or natural gas prices increase, the Company&#8217;s cost for additional reserves could also increase. \n\nThe Company may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. \n\nAlthough the Company performs a review of properties that it acquires, which the Company believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, the Company will focus its review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit the Company as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the Company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the Company&#8217;s operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the Company&#8217;s ongoing operations. \n\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly. \n\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. The Company&#8217;s reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of the Company&#8217;s proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including historical production from the area compared with production from other areas, the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes, future operating costs and capital expenditures, and workover and remediation costs. \n\nFor these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to the Company&#8217;s reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. \n\nAdditionally, because some of the Company&#8217;s reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the Company&#8217;s development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. \n\nCertain of the Company&#8217;s undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. \n\nA sizeable portion of the Company&#8217;s acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If the leases expire, the Company will lose its right to develop the related properties. The Company&#8217;s drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO COUNTERPARTIES \n\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect the Company. \n\nThe Company is party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of the Company&#8217;s current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to the Company and their willingness to enter into future transactions with the Company. The Company may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. The Company also has exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under the Company&#8217;s policies. In addition, if any lender under the Company&#8217;s credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, the Company&#8217;s liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender&#8217;s commitment under the credit facilities. \n\nThe Company is exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant changes in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty&#8217;s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. The Company is unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty&#8217;s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if the Company does accurately predict sudden changes, its ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company&#8217;s hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that the Company would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to it by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices, the Company&#8217;s hedge receivable positions increase, which increases the Company&#8217;s exposure. If the creditworthiness of the counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, the Company could incur a significant loss. \n\nThe distressed financial conditions of the Company&#8217;s partners and the purchasers of the Company&#8217;s products or assets have had and could have an adverse impact on the Company in the event they are unable to reimburse the Company for their share of costs or to pay the Company for the products or services the Company provides. \n\nConcerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. The Company is exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. The Company sells its crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, the Company pays expenses and bills its non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of recent economic conditions and the previously severe decline in commodity prices, some of the Company&#8217;s customers and non-operating partners experienced severe financial problems that had a significant impact on their creditworthiness. The Company cannot provide assurance that one or more of its financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to the Company or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company&#8217;s customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint have made it and might make it unlikely that the Company will or would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of its transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case. \n\nFrom time to time the Company divests noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, bonds, letters of credit, and similar \n\narrangements. One of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by the Company. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which are collectively referred to as Insolvency Laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, the Company&#8217;s remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not the Company has collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of the Company&#8217;s claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise, pending final resolution of the proceeding. \n\nDespite the provisions in the Company&#8217;s agreements requiring purchasers of its state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, the Company would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require it to perform and hold it responsible for such liabilities and obligations. In such event, the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise. \n\nIf a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s cash flows, operations, or financial condition. \n\nFor additional information regarding Apache&#8217;s prior Gulf of Mexico properties and the bankruptcy of the purchaser of those properties, see the information set forth under &#8220;Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties&#8221; in Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nThe Company does not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements or joint ventures, and the parties to such agreements or ventures may fail to meet their obligations. \n\nThe Company conducts many of its exploration and production (E&#38;P) operations through joint operating agreements or joint ventures with other parties. The Company may not control decisions made under such agreements or ventures, either because it does not have a controlling interest in the venture or is not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that the other parties to these arrangements may have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s, and, therefore, decisions may be made that the Company does not believe are in its best interest. Moreover, parties to such agreements or ventures may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and the Company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of the investment and the Company&#8217;s business and financial condition may be adversely affected. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO CAPITAL MARKETS \n\nA downgrade in the Company&#8217;s credit rating could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital. \n\nThe Company receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact the Company&#8217;s credit ratings include its debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt. During 2022, the Company&#8217;s credit rating was affirmed by Moody&#8217;s as Ba1/Positive and by Standard and Poor&#8217;s as BB+/Positive. Past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, the Company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. \n\nMarket conditions may restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit its financial flexibility. \n\nThe financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. The Company has a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. The Company and/or its partners may need to seek financing to fund these or other future activities. The Company&#8217;s future access to capital, as well as that of its partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of the Company&#8217;s property interests. \n\nAPA Corporation&#8217;s syndicated credit facilities currently mature in April 2027. There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to APA, the Company, or APA&#8217;s other subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders. \n\nActions by advocacy groups to advance climate change and energy transition initiatives, unfavorable ESG ratings, and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of capital from companies in the oil and gas industry, which could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s access to and costs of capital or the market for the Company&#8217;s securities. \n\nOrganizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company, which may cause the market for the Company&#8217;s securities to be negatively impacted. \n\nIn addition, a number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to influence change in the business strategies in oil and gas companies, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities, and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change and energy transition matters, such as promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products and encouraging the divestment of investments in the oil and gas industry, as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with oil and gas companies. If investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in the oil and gas industry, the Company&#8217;s access to and costs of capital or the market for the Company&#8217;s securities may be negatively impacted. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL RESULTS \n\nFuture economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets may materially adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operating results. \n\nCurrent global market conditions and uncertainty, including economic instability in emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on the Company&#8217;s operating results. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for the Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce the Company&#8217;s cash flows from operations and its profitability. \n\nThe Company faces strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&#38;P industry. The Company competes with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than the Company possesses and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry. As a consequence, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of the Company&#8217;s larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. The Company also competes in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change. \n\nAs described in Note 11&#8212;Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income. If the Company were to experience an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change, by value, in the Company&#8217;s equity ownership by five-percent shareholders over a three-year period, the Company&#8217;s \n\nability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to potentially offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Such a limitation could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND POLITICAL RISKS \n\nThe Company may incur significant costs related to environmental matters. \n\nAs an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. The Company&#8217;s efforts to limit its exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to the Company&#8217;s results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require the Company to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s cash flows and its financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. operations are subject to governmental risks. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s U.S. operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations. \n\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nWith respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies&#8217; oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM&#8217;s website as &#8220;rescinded,&#8221; if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache&#8217;s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. Additionally, the Company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties&#8217; solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. \n\nNew political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting the Company&#8217;s U.S. operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nProposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the Company&#8217;s operating and capital costs. \n\nSeveral proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. The Company routinely uses fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability. \n\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the Company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S. \n\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nThe U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas E&#38;P companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. The Company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nOn May 26, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a new tax (the Energy Profits Levy) on the profits of oil and gas companies operating in the U.K. and the U.K. Continental Shelf. Under the new law, an additional levy is assessed at a 25 percent rate and is effective for the period of May 26, 2022, through December 31, 2025. On November 17, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Autumn Statement 2022 further changes to the Energy Profits Levy, increasing the levy assessed from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2028. On November 22, 2022, the U.K. Government published draft legislation to implement this change, among other provisions, and on January 10, 2023, the Finance Act 2023 was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. The impact of this tax could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s future financial condition and cash flows. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other changes, the IRA introduced a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) that exceeds $1.0 billion for any three consecutive tax years preceding the tax year at issue. If the Company were to meet this average AFSI test, any resulting Corporate AMT liability could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s future financial results, including earnings and cash flows. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE \n\nThe impacts of energy transition could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to climate change and energy transition. This focus, together with shifting preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy, the use of hydrocarbons, and the use of products manufactured with, or powered by, hydrocarbons, may result in increased availability of, and demand for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric power; technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage, and consumption of alternative energy sources; and development of, and increased demand from consumers and industries for, lower-emission products and services, including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies, as well as more energy-efficient products and services. \n\nThese developments could adversely impact the demand for products powered by or manufactured with hydrocarbons and the demand for the Company&#8217;s, and in turn the prices it receives for its, crude oil, natural gas, and NGL products, which could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and financial performance. \n\nChanges to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nCertain countries where the Company operates, including the U.K., either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on the Company&#8217;s operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where the Company operates, including the U.S., regarding legislation or regulation of GHGs, including to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs and to restrict or eliminate future emissions. Moreover, in January 2021, the \n\nPresident issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. \n\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates, and combustion engine phaseouts. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks related to climate change may result in curtailed refinery activity, increased regulation, or other adverse direct and indirect effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, there is a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. \n\nAny such legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives, if enacted, or additional or increased taxes, assessments, or GHG-related fees on the Company&#8217;s operations could lead to increased operating expenses or cause the Company to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications. \n\nEnhanced focus on ESG matters could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations. \n\nEnhanced focus on ESG matters related to, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory review, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, increased risk of litigation, and adverse impacts on the Company&#8217;s access to capital. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits the Company requires to conduct its operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to profitably conduct its business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s estimates used in various scenario planning analyses could differ materially from actual results and could expose the Company to new or additional risks. \n\nIn 2021, the Company undertook a scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board&#8217;s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This expanded climate-focused scenario planning framework included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets, as well as changes in government regulations and policy. Given the dynamic nature of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company generally performs annual scenario analyses with five-year time horizons. When analyzing longer-term TCFD scenarios, the Company relies on external analysis for demand scenarios, carbon pricing, and comparison-pricing scenarios, which are then compared to the Company&#8217;s internally prepared base-case pricing analysis averaged out to 2040. Given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios, the Company&#8217;s estimates could differ materially from actual results. Additionally, by electing to set and share publicly these metrics in the Company&#8217;s sustainability report and the Company&#8217;s commitment to expand upon its disclosures, the Company&#8217;s business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives. As a result, the Company could damage its reputation if it fails to act responsibly in the areas in which it reports. Any harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation resulting from setting these metrics, expanding its disclosures, or its failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial performance, and growth. \n\nThe Company operates in Gulf Coast wetlands, which face threats from climate change and human activities. \n\nA changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial, to the areas in which the Company operates, including Gulf Coast wetlands. For several decades, the State of Louisiana has lost an estimated 20 square miles of wetlands per year, due to natural processes of subsidence, saltwater intrusion, and shoreline erosion, as well as human activities, such as levee construction along the Mississippi River and the dredging of navigation canals. A possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and major flooding events. The risk of increased or more severe hurricanes or flooding events along or near the Gulf Coast could increase the Company&#8217;s costs to repair damaged facilities and restore production. Additionally, federal, state, and local laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to the Company&#8217;s operations, including: (i) the limitation or prohibition of certain activities on wetlands; (ii) the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; (iii) the reporting of the types and quantities of various substances that are generated, stored, processed, or released in connection with protected properties; and \n\n(iv) the installation of costly emission monitoring and/or pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of the Company&#8217;s operations. In addition, the Company may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt the Company&#8217;s operations or specific projects and limit its growth and revenue. \n\nThe guidance upon which the Company&#8217;s consumptive water use reporting was modified and could be revised in the future, resulting in the over or underreporting of the Company&#8217;s consumptive water use, and could expose the Company to financial risk. \n\nBased on Ipieca&#8217;s Sustainability Reporting Guidance of the Oil and Gas Industry (2020), the Company modified the way it reports its water data compared to previous years and also restated data from past years. Previously, the Company included produced water usage in its consumptive use calculations, which led to an over-reporting of consumptive water use. Based on re-evaluation of water reporting definitions and guidance, the Company determined that produced water &#8211; non-potable water released from deep underground formations and brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production &#8211; should not be classified as consumed in the same sense as fresh water. Produced water is generally not of the quality that most users would be able to utilize and is therefore not available for third-party usage outside of the oilfield. The Company&#8217;s revised reporting now reflects only fresh water and non-potable water from surface water or shallow groundwater that are consumed in oil and gas operations. \n\nThe treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted and could expose the Company to additional costs or limit certain operations. \n\nThe treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. The Company&#8217;s ability to accurately report and track its water use is necessary for its continued ability to reuse and recycle water, when possible. While the Company remains focused on reusing or recycling water over disposal of water, the Company&#8217;s costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly if reusing and recycling water becomes impractical. Further, compliance with reporting and environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage, use, and discharge of water may increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial conditions. \n\nIn response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has been developing data associated with seismic activity, particularly such activity related to injection wells used for produced water disposal. In September 2021, the RRC began to limit saltwater disposal in the Midland Basin under what is known as a Seismic Response Action (or SAR) due to increased seismic activity. \n\nAmong other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells, and allow the state to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. States may issue orders to temporarily shut down or to curtail the injection depth of existing wells in the vicinity of seismic events. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation to limit or prohibit oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. These developments could result in restriction of disposal wells that could have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s capital expenses and operating costs or limit production in certain areas. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS \n\nInternational operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations outside the U.S. are based primarily in Egypt and the U.K. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 47 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 production was outside the U.S., and approximately 32 percent of the Company&#8217;s estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2022, were located outside the U.S. As a result, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#8226; general strikes and civil unrest; \n\n&#8226; the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, including through prospective or retroactive changes in the laws and regulations applicable to such contracts; \n\n&#8226; import and export regulations; \n\n&#8226; taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions; \n\n&#8226; price control; \n\n&#8226; transportation regulations and tariffs; \n\n&#8226; constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area; \n\n&#8226; exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds; \n\n&#8226; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions; \n\n&#8226; the long-term effects of the U.K.&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the British pound; \n\n&#8226; the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where the Company currently operates; \n\n&#8226; the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S.; and \n\n&#8226; difficulties in enforcing the Company&#8217;s rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations. \n\nForeign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to the Company by another country, the Company&#8217;s interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even the Company&#8217;s smaller international assets may affect its overall business and results of operations by distracting management&#8217;s attention from its more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which the Company operates have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as the Company&#8217;s. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of the Company&#8217;s assets. This could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s interests and its future profitability. \n\nThe impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which the Company operates, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on the Company&#8217;s operations in particular is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. The Company may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard its assets against terrorist activities. \n\nA deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nDeterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of the Company&#8217;s assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of the Company&#8217;s existing contracts with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company&#8217;s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of noncontrolling interests, contributed 22 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 production and accounted for 11 percent of the Company&#8217;s year-end estimated proved reserves and 22 percent of the Company&#8217;s estimated discounted future net cash flows. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. The Company&#8217;s financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign \n\ncurrency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. \n\n##TABLE_START ITEM 1B.

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following discussion relates to Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company) and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be read together in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated by reference to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of Apache Corporation&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022). \n\nOn March 1, 2021, Apache consummated a holding company reorganization (the Holding Company Reorganization), pursuant to which Apache became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation (APA), and all of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of APA. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, APA became the successor issuer to the Company pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act and replaced the Company as the public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;APA.&#8221; The Holding Company Reorganization modernized APA&#8217;s operating and legal structure, making it more consistent with other companies that have affiliates operating around the globe. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail. \n\nOverview \n\nApache, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The Company&#8217;s upstream business currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, the Company&#8217;s midstream business was operated by Altus. Altus owned, developed, and operated a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas. \n\nApache believes energy underpins global progress, and the Company wants to be a part of the conversation and solution as society works to meet growing global demand for reliable and affordable energy. Apache strives to meet those challenges while creating value for all its stakeholders. \n\nEarly in 2020, impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related governmental actions began to exert significant downward pressure on crude oil and natural gas prices. Since that time, commodity prices worldwide have largely rebounded; however, uncertainties in the global supply chain, commodity prices, and financial markets, including the impact of inflation, rising interest rates, and the conflict in Ukraine continue to impact oil supply and demand. Despite these uncertainties, the Company remains committed to its longer-term objectives: (1) to maintain a balanced asset portfolio; (2) to invest for long-term returns over production growth; and (3) to budget conservatively to generate cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration, appraisal, and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction, share repurchases, and other return of capital to its shareholders. The Company continues to aggressively manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment and closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals to reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company reported net income of $3.5 billion compared to net income of $1.1 billion in 2021. Net income in 2022 benefited from higher commodity prices and increased revenues attributable to a new merged concession agreement in Egypt. The increase in realized prices was primarily driven by the effects of global inflation, the conflict in Ukraine on global commodity prices, and uncertainties around spare capacity and energy security globally. \n\nThe Company generated $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities in 2022, which was $1.3 billion, or 38 percent, higher than the prior year. Apache&#8217;s higher operating cash flows for 2022 were driven by higher crude oil and natural gas prices and associated revenues. Since year-end 2021, the Company has reduced its total outstanding debt and redeemable preferred interests by $2.6 billion and $712 million, respectively, through the deconsolidation of ALTM and the retirement of outstanding notes and debentures. \n\nOperational Highlights \n\nKey operational highlights for the year include: \n\nUnited States \n\n&#8226; Daily boe production from the Company&#8217;s U.S. assets, which decreased 12 percent from the prior year end, accounted for 52 percent of its total worldwide production during 2022. During 2022, the Company averaged 4 drilling rigs in the U.S., averaging 2 rigs each in the Southern Midland Basin and Delaware Basin assets. The Company&#8217;s core Midland Basin development program is expected to represent key growth areas for the U.S. assets. \n\nInternational \n\n&#8226; In December 2021, the Egyptian President signed and ratified the previously announced agreement with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) to modernize the terms of the majority of the Company&#8217;s production-sharing contracts, having an effective date of April 1, 2021. The new merged concession agreement (MCA) consolidated 98 percent of gross acreage and 90 percent of gross production under one concession agreement and refreshes the existing development lease terms for 20 years and exploration leases for 5 years. The consolidated concession has a single cost recovery pool that provides improved access to cost recovery, a fixed 40 percent cost recovery limit, and a fixed profit-sharing rate of 30 percent for all the Company&#8217;s production covered under the new concession. The changes also simplify the contractual relationship with EGPC, facilitate recovery of prior investment, and update day-to-day operational governance. Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in the Company&#8217;s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business, and a portion of the remaining net income and distributable cash flow is allocated to APA in accordance with the terms of the agreement. \n\n&#8226; Egypt gross equivalent production decreased 1 percent and net production increased 26 percent from 2021, primarily a function of improved cost recovery under the new merged concession agreement ratified at the end of 2021. The Company continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory in Egypt, supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations on both new and existing acreage. The Company continues to increase drilling and workover activity as a result of the merged concession agreement. Egypt production growth is building on improvements in new well connections and recompletion activity. \n\n&#8226; During 2022, the Company focused on several environmental initiatives in Egypt and has delivered on its 2022 upstream flaring reduction goal by flaring at least 40 percent less gas than would otherwise be flared without these initiatives, with the Company now compressing this gas into sales lines. \n\n&#8226; The North Sea maintained two drilling rigs during 2022. Production was negatively impacted by considerable planned and unplanned downtime at Beryl and Forties during the third quarter of 2022, improving in the fourth quarter of 2022 following completion of these maintenance activities. \n\nFor a more detailed discussion related to the Company&#8217;s various geographic segments, refer to &#8220;Upstream Exploration and Production Properties&#8212;Operating Areas&#8221; set forth in Part I, Item 1 and 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nAcquisition and Divestiture Activity \n\nOver the Company&#8217;s history, it has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize Apache&#8217;s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, the Company has completed a series of acquisitions and divestitures designed to enhance the Company&#8217;s portfolio and monetize nonstrategic assets in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These acquisitions and divestitures during 2022 include: \n\n&#8226; BCP Business Combination On February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP and, together with BCP Raptor Holdco GP, LLC, the Contributed Entities) in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement entered into by and among ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, New BCP Raptor Holdco, LLC (the Contributor), and BCP (the BCP Contribution Agreement). Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. (Kinetik). As consideration for the contribution of the Contributed Interests, ALTM issued 50 million shares of Class C Common Stock (and Altus Midstream LP issued a corresponding number of common units) to BCP&#8217;s unitholders. \n\nALTM&#8217;s stockholders continued to hold their existing shares of ALTM common stock. Apache Midstream LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of APA, which owned approximately 79 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock prior to the BCP Business Combination, owned approximately 20 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Kinetik common stock after the transaction closed. The Company deconsolidated ALTM upon closing the transaction and recognized a gain of approximately $609 million that reflects the difference of the Company&#8217;s share of ALTM&#8217;s deconsolidated balance sheet and the fair value of its 20 percent retained ownership in the combined entity. \n\nSubsequent to the close of the transaction, in March 2022, the Company sold four million of its shares of Kinetik Class A Common Stock for $224 million, reducing the Company&#8217;s retained ownership percentage in Kinetik to approximately 13 percent. \n\n&#8226; Delaware Basin Divestitures During 2022, the Company completed a previously announced transaction to sell certain non-core mineral rights in the Delaware Basin, for total cash proceeds of $726 million. \n\n&#8226; U.S. Leasehold Acquisitions During 2022, the Company completed other leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of approximately $37 million. \n\n&#8226; U.S. Leasehold Divestitures &#38; Other During 2022, the Company completed the sale of non-core assets and leasehold in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $52 million. \n\nFor detailed information regarding Apache&#8217;s acquisitions and divestitures, refer to Note 3&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nOil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids Production Revenues \n\nThe Company&#8217;s production revenues and respective contribution to total revenues by country are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; $ Value % Contribution $ Value % Contribution $ Value % Contribution &#160; ($ in millions) Oil Revenues: United States $ 2,323 35 % $ 1,850 40 % $ 1,209 39 % Egypt (1) \n\n3,145 47 % 1,806 40 % 1,102 35 % North Sea 1,232 18 % 929 20 % 795 26 % Total (1) \n\n$ 6,700 100 % $ 4,585 100 % $ 3,106 100 % Natural Gas Revenues: United States $ 894 58 % $ 754 62 % $ 251 42 % Egypt (1) \n\n370 24 % 270 23 % 280 47 % North Sea 281 18 % 183 15 % 67 11 % Total (1) \n\n$ 1,545 100 % $ 1,207 100 % $ 598 100 % NGL Revenues: United States $ 732 93 % $ 673 95 % $ 304 91 % Egypt (1) \n\n6 1 % 9 1 % 8 3 % North Sea 45 6 % 24 4 % 21 6 % Total (1) \n\n$ 783 100 % $ 706 100 % $ 333 100 % Oil and Gas Revenues: United States $ 3,949 44 % $ 3,277 50 % $ 1,764 44 % Egypt (1) \n\n3,521 39 % 2,085 32 % 1,390 34 % North Sea 1,558 17 % 1,136 18 % 883 22 % Total (1) \n\n$ 9,028 100 % $ 6,498 100 % $ 4,037 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes revenues attributable to noncontrolling interests in Egypt. \n\nProduction \n\nThe following table presents production volumes by country: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 Increase (Decrease) 2021 Increase (Decrease) 2020 Oil Volumes &#8211; b/d: United States (5) \n\n66,142 (12)% 75,205 (15)% 88,249 Egypt (3)(4) \n\n85,081 21% 70,349 (7)% 75,384 North Sea 32,578 (10)% 36,265 (28)% 50,386 Total 183,801 1% 181,819 (15)% 214,019 Natural Gas Volumes &#8211; Mcf/d: United States (5) \n\n459,123 (13)% 527,461 (6)% 561,731 Egypt (3)(4) \n\n356,327 35% 263,653 (4)% 274,175 North Sea 35,327 (8)% 38,565 (33)% 57,464 Total 850,777 3% 829,679 (7)% 893,370 NGL Volumes &#8211; b/d: United States (5) \n\n59,887 (10)% 66,232 (11)% 74,136 Egypt (3)(4) \n\n196 (63)% 531 (30)% 754 North Sea 1,111 (7)% 1,199 (38)% 1,936 Total 61,194 (10)% 67,962 (12)% 76,826 \n\nBOE per day: (1) \n\nUnited States (5) \n\n202,549 (12)% 229,348 (10)% 256,007 Egypt (3)(4) \n\n144,665 26% 114,821 (6)% 121,834 North Sea (2) \n\n39,577 (10)% 43,892 (29)% 61,899 Total 386,791 &#8212;% 388,061 (12)% 439,740 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The table shows production on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a 6:1 energy equivalent ratio.

Average realized crude oil prices for 2022 were up 44 percent compared to 2021, a direct result of the rising benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in 2022 averaged $99.39 per barrel. \n\nContinued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of the Company&#8217;s asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. \n\nNatural Gas Prices Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The Company&#8217;s primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in the Company&#8217;s primary gas-producing regions follows: \n\n&#8226; The Company sells its U.S. natural gas production at liquid index sales points within the U.S., at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The Company&#8217;s U.S. realizations averaged $5.33 per Mcf in 2022, a 36 percent increase from an average of $3.92 per Mcf in 2021. \n\n&#8226; In Egypt, the Company&#8217;s natural gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the Company&#8217;s Egypt operations averaged $2.85 per Mcf in 2022, a 1 percent increase from an average of $2.81 per Mcf in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The Company&#8217;s North Sea operations averaged $23.36 per Mcf in 2022, an 80 percent increase from an average of $12.96 per Mcf in 2021. \n\nNGL Prices The Company&#8217;s U.S. NGL production, which accounted for 98 percent of the Company&#8217;s total 2022 NGL production, is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser. \n\nCrude Oil Revenues &#160; \n\nCrude oil revenues for 2022 totaled $6.7 billion, a $2.1 billion increase from the 2021 total of $4.6 billion. A 44 percent increase in average realized prices increased 2022 revenues by $2.0 billion compared to 2021, while 1 percent higher average daily production increased revenues by $98 million. Average daily production in 2022 was 184 Mb/d, with prices averaging $99.39 per barrel. Crude oil sales accounted for 74 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 oil and gas production revenues and 48 percent of its worldwide production. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil production increased 2 Mb/d compared to 2021, primarily a function of improved cost recovery under the merged concession agreement in Egypt ratified at the end of 2021, offset by extended operational downtime in the North Sea and natural production decline across all assets. \n\nNatural Gas Revenues &#160; \n\nNatural gas revenues for 2022 totaled $1.5 billion, a $338 million increase from the 2021 total of $1.2 billion. A 25 percent increase in average realized prices increased 2022 revenues by $303 million compared to 2021, while 3 percent higher average daily production increased revenues by $35 million. Average daily production in 2022 was 851 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $4.97 per Mcf. Natural gas sales accounted for 17 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 oil and gas production revenues and 36 percent of its worldwide production. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s worldwide natural gas production increased 21 MMcf/d compared to 2021, primarily a result of increased net production in Egypt resulting from improved cost recovery under the merged concession agreement ratified at the end of 2021, offset by extended operational downtime in the North Sea and natural production decline across all assets. \n\nNGL Revenues &#160; \n\nNGL revenues for 2022 totaled $783 million, a $77 million increase from the 2021 total of $706 million. A 22 percent increase in average realized prices increased 2022 revenues by $152 million compared to 2021, while 10 percent lower average daily production decreased revenues by $75 million. Average daily production in 2022 was 61 Mb/d, with prices averaging $34.62 per barrel. NGL sales accounted for 9 percent of the Company&#8217;s 2022 oil and gas production revenues and 16 percent of its worldwide production. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s worldwide NGL production decreased 7 Mb/d compared to 2021, primarily a result of natural production decline in the U.S. \n\nAltus Midstream Revenues \n\nPrior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, the Company beneficially owned approximately 79 percent of ALTM&#8217;s outstanding voting common stock. Altus owned and operated a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas primarily to service the Company&#8217;s production from its Alpine High resource play, which commenced production in May 2017. \n\nAltus Midstream primarily generated revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Altus Midstream&#8217;s service revenues generated through its fee-based contractual arrangements with the Company totaled $16 million and $127 million, respectively. These affiliated revenues were eliminated upon consolidation. \n\nPurchased Oil and Gas Sales \n\nPurchased oil and gas sales represent volumes primarily attributable to transport, fuel, and physical in-basin gas purchases that were sold by the Company to fulfill natural gas takeaway obligations. Sales related to these purchased volumes increased $368 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion in the prior year. Purchased oil and gas sales were offset by associated purchase costs of $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase is a result of higher average natural gas prices during 2022 compared to the prior year. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nThe table below presents a comparison of the Company&#8217;s operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. All operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Altus. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Lease operating expenses $ 1,435 $ 1,241 $ 1,127 Gathering, processing, and transmission 356 264 274 Purchased oil and gas costs 1,776 1,580 357 Taxes other than income 256 204 123 Exploration 146 127 274 General and administrative 462 357 290 Transaction, reorganization, and separation 26 22 54 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization: Oil and gas property and equipment 1,130 1,255 1,643 Gathering, processing, and transmission assets 15 64 76 Other assets 32 41 53 Asset retirement obligation accretion 117 113 109 Impairments &#8212; 208 4,501 Financing costs, net 313 472 267 ##TABLE_END\n\nLease Operating Expenses (LOE) \n\nLOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repairs and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Crude oil, which accounted for 48 percent of the Company&#8217;s total 2022 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties. \n\nDuring 2022, LOE increased $194 million, or 16 percent, compared to 2021. On a per-boe basis, LOE increased $1.14, or 13 percent, compared to 2021, from $8.75 per boe to $9.89 per boe. The increase in costs was driven by higher labor costs and operating costs trending with higher oil and gas prices and global inflation, coupled with higher workover activity in the U.S. during 2022. \n\nGathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT) \n\nGPT expenses include amounts paid to third-party carriers and to Altus Midstream for gathering and transmission services for the Company&#8217;s upstream natural gas production associated with its Alpine High play. GPT expenses also include midstream operating costs incurred by Altus Midstream. The following table presents a summary of these expenses: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Third-party processing and transmission costs $ 260 $ 232 $ 236 Midstream service costs - ALTM 18 128 143 Midstream service costs - Kinetik 91 &#8212; &#8212; Upstream processing and transmission costs 369 360 379 Midstream operating expenses 5 32 38 Intersegment eliminations (18) (128) (143) Total Gathering, processing, and transmission $ 356 $ 264 $ 274 ##TABLE_END\n\nGPT costs increased $92 million compared to 2021. Third-party processing and transmission costs increased $28 million, primarily driven by an increase in average transportation rates during the year. Costs for services provided by ALTM in the first quarter of 2022 and prior to the BCP Business Combination totaling $18 million were eliminated in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and reflected as &#8220;Intersegment eliminations&#8221; in the table above. Subsequent to the BCP Business Combination and the Company&#8217;s deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, these midstream services continue to be provided by Kinetik but are no longer eliminated. Midstream services provided by Kinetik totaled $91 million for the year ended 2022. \n\nPurchased Oil and Gas Costs \n\nPurchased oil and gas costs increased $196 million compared to 2021, and were primarily offset by associated sales totaling $1.9 billion for the year ended 2022, as discussed above. \n\nTaxes Other Than Incom e \n\nTaxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on onshore properties and in state waters off the coast of the U.S. and ad valorem taxes on U.S. properties. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. The Company is also subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes. \n\nTaxes other than income increased $52 million compared to 2021, primarily from higher severance taxes driven by higher commodity prices. \n\nExploration Expenses \n\nExploration expenses include unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expenses, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Unproved leasehold impairments $ 24 $ 31 $ 101 Dry hole expenses 69 55 110 Geological and geophysical expenses 6 8 20 Exploration overhead and other 47 33 43 Total Exploration $ 146 $ 127 $ 274 ##TABLE_END\n\nExploration expenses increased $19 million compared to 2021, primarily the result of higher dry hole expenses in Egypt and higher exploration overhead, a function of increased exploration activities. \n\nGeneral and Administrative (G&#38;A) Expenses \n\nG&#38;A expenses increased $105 million compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher cash-based stock compensation expense resulting from an increase in the Company&#8217;s stock price and achievement of performance and financial objectives as defined in the stock award plans. Higher overall wages across the Company and global inflationary pressures also impacted G&#38;A expenses compared to the prior-year period. \n\nTransaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS) Costs \n\nTRS costs increased $4 million compared to 2021, primarily a result of transaction costs from the BCP Business Combination, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the Company&#8217;s prior year reorganization efforts that are substantially completed. \n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&#38;A) \n\nDD&#38;A expenses on the Company&#8217;s oil and gas property for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $125 million compared to 2021. The Company&#8217;s oil and gas property DD&#38;A rate decreased $1.06 per boe in 2022 compared to 2021, from $8.85 per boe to $7.79 per boe. The decrease on an absolute basis was driven by lower depletion rates in Egypt under the new merged concession agreement, partially offset by higher production volumes. DD&#38;A expense on the Company&#8217;s GPT depreciation decreased $49 million compared to 2021, primarily driven by certain Egyptian assets being fully depreciated coupled with the deconsolidation of Altus during the first quarter of 2022. \n\nImpairments \n\nNo asset impairments were recorded in 2022. During 2021, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $208 million. The charges include $160 million for Altus&#8217; equity method interests, $26 million in connection with inventory valuations in Egypt, and $22 million in connection with inventory valuations and expected equipment dispositions in the North Sea. \n\nDuring 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments in connection with fair value assessments totaling $4.5 billion, including $4.3 billion for oil and gas proved properties in the U.S, Egypt, and the North Sea, $68 million for GPT facilities in Egypt, $87 million for goodwill in Egypt, and $27 million for inventory and other miscellaneous assets. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded for 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Oil and gas proved property $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 4,319 GPT facilities &#8212; &#8212; 68 Equity method interests &#8212; 160 &#8212; Goodwill &#8212; &#8212; 87 Inventory and other &#8212; 48 27 Total Impairments $ &#8212; $ 208 $ 4,501 ##TABLE_END\n\nFinancing Costs, Net \n\nFinancing costs incurred during 2022, 2021, and 2020 comprised the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Interest expense $ 312 $ 419 $ 438 Amortization of debt issuance costs 7 8 8 Capitalized interest (1) &#8212; (12) Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 67 104 (160) Interest income (9) (8) (7) Interest income from APA Corporation, net (63) (51) &#8212; Total Financing costs, net $ 313 $ 472 $ 267 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet financing costs during 2022 decreased $159 million compared to 2021, primarily the result of the reduction of fixed-rate debt during 2021 and the first half of 2022. Additionally, losses incurred on the extinguishment of debt were lower during 2022 compared to the prior year period. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nIncome tax expense increased $1.1 billion from $578 million during 2021 to $1.7 billion during 2022. The Company&#8217;s year-to-date 2022 effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by a deferred tax expense related to the remeasurement of taxes in the U.K. as a result of the enactment of the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act 2022 (the Energy Profits Levy) on July 14, 2022, and a decrease in the amount of valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets. During 2021, the Company&#8217;s effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by asset impairments and a decrease in the amount of valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets. \n\nOn May 26, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a new tax (the Energy Profits Levy) on the profits of oil and gas companies operating in the U.K. and the U.K. Continental Shelf. Under the new law, an additional levy is assessed at a 25 percent rate and is effective for the period of May 26, 2022, through December 31, 2025. The Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $208 million associated with the remeasurement of the U.K. deferred tax liability. On November 17, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Autumn Statement 2022 further changes to the Energy Profits Levy, increasing the levy assessed from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2028. On November 22, 2022, the U.K. Government published draft legislation to implement this change, among other provisions, and on January 10, 2023, the Finance Act 2023 was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. Under U.S. GAAP, the financial statement impact of new legislation is recorded in the period of enactment. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company expects to record a deferred tax expense of approximately $170 million to $190 million related to the remeasurement of the December 31, 2022 U.K. deferred tax liability. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA includes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. The Corporate AMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the provisions of the IRA and awaits further guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department to properly assess the impact of these provisions on the Company. \n\nThe Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of negative evidence evaluated was the U.S. pre-tax book cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. This cumulative loss was primarily the result of low commodity prices and oil and gas impairments during this period. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company&#8217;s projections for future growth. \n\nHowever, given the Company&#8217;s current and anticipated future domestic earnings, the Company believes that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months the U.S. will exit its cumulative loss, allowing the Company to reach a conclusion that a material portion of the U.S. valuation allowance may no longer be needed. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense, which could be material for the period the release is recorded. For additional information regarding income taxes, refer to Note 11&#8212;Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company&#8217;s tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2014-2017 tax years and is also under audit in various states and foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business. \n\nPotential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties \n\nThe Company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. Apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of such GOM assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, Apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, Apache may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise. \n\nIn 2013, Apache sold its GOM Shelf operations and properties and its GOM operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $3.75 billion and Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOM Assets). In respect of such abandonment obligations, Fieldwood posted letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit) and established trust accounts (Trust A and Trust B) of which Apache was a beneficiary and which were funded by two net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the 2018 bankruptcy, Fieldwood confirmed a plan under which Apache agreed, inter alia, to (i) accept bonds in exchange for certain of the Letters of Credit and (ii) amend the Trust A trust agreement and one of the NPIs to consolidate the trusts into a single Trust (Trust A) funded by both remaining NPIs. Currently, Apache holds two bonds (Bonds) and five Letters of Credit backed by investment-grade counterparties to secure Fieldwood&#8217;s asset retirement obligations on the Legacy GOM Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for decommissioning any Legacy GOM Asset over the remaining life of the Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nOn August 3, 2020, Fieldwood again filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 25, 2021, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) entered an order confirming Fieldwood&#8217;s bankruptcy plan. On August 27, 2021, Fieldwood&#8217;s bankruptcy plan became effective. Pursuant to the plan, the Legacy GOM Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf&#8217;s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOM Assets will be used to fund decommissioning of Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nBy letter dated April 5, 2022, replacing two prior letters dated September 8, 2021 and February 22, 2022, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it is currently obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOM Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE to decommission certain of the Legacy GOM Assets included in GOM Shelf&#8217;s notification to BSEE. Apache expects to receive such orders on the other Legacy GOM Assets included in GOM Shelf&#8217;s notification letter. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nIf Apache incurs costs to decommission any Legacy GOM Asset and GOM Shelf does not reimburse Apache for such costs, then Apache expects to obtain reimbursement from Trust A, the Bonds, and the Letters of Credit until such funds and securities are fully utilized. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache has agreed to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $400 million to perform decommissioning (Standby Loan Agreement), with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nIf the combination of GOM Shelf&#8217;s net cash flow from its producing properties, the Trust A funds, the Bonds, and the remaining Letters of Credit are insufficient to fully fund decommissioning of any Legacy GOM Assets that Apache may be ordered by BSEE to perform, or if GOM Shelf&#8217;s net cash flow from its remaining producing properties after the Trust A funds, Bonds, and Letters of Credit are exhausted is insufficient to repay any loans made by Apache under the Standby Loan Agreement, then Apache may be forced to effectively use its available cash to fund the deficit. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund decommissioning of Legacy GOM Assets it may be ordered to perform ranges from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a contingent liability of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022, representing the estimated costs of decommissioning it may be required to perform on Legacy GOM Assets. Of the total liability recorded, $738 million is reflected under the caption &#8220;Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of Mexico properties,&#8221; and $450 million is reflected under &#8220;Other current liabilities&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache&#8217;s estimated liability, including expected decommissioning rig spread rates, lift boat rates, and planned abandonment logistics could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has also recorded a $667 million asset, which represents the amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from the Trust A funds, the Bonds, and the Letters of Credit for decommissioning it may be required to perform on Legacy GOM Assets. Of the total asset recorded, $217 million is reflected under the caption &#8220;Decommissioning security for sold Gulf of Mexico properties,&#8221; and $450 million is reflected under &#8220;Other current assets.&#8221; The Company recognized $157 million and $446 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, of &#8220;Losses on previously sold Gulf of Mexico properties&#8221; to reflect the net impact of changes to the estimated decommissioning liability and decommissioning asset to the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. \n\nInsurance Program \n\nThe Company is covered by insurance for physical damage to its assets, general liabilities, workers&#8217; compensation, employers&#8217; liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. The Company&#8217;s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that it must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, such insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect the Company against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Further, the Company does not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including Gulf of Mexico named windstorm and business interruption. Service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify the Company for injuries and death of the service provider&#8217;s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider. \n\nThe Company is covered by a multi-year political risk insurance from The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit Trade (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $500 million. \n\nThe Company also has an insurance policy with U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $150 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed the Company on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent the Company from exporting its share of production. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides $60 million in reinsurance to DFC. \n\nFuture insurance coverage for the Company&#8217;s industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe Company prepares its financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company identifies certain accounting policies involving estimation as critical accounting estimates based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting estimates address accounting matters that are inherently uncertain due to unknown future resolution of such matters. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each critical accounting estimate. The following is a discussion of the Company&#8217;s most critical accounting estimates. \n\nReserves Estimates \n\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. \n\nProved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. \n\nDespite significant judgment involved in these engineering estimates, the Company&#8217;s reserves are used throughout its financial statements. For example, since the Company uses the units-of-production method to amortize its oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact DD&#38;A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for the Company&#8217;s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. For more information regarding the Company&#8217;s supplemental oil and gas disclosures, refer to Note 19&#8212;Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nReserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous twelve months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. \n\nThe Company has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing. \n\nOil and Gas Exploration Costs \n\nThe Company accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. \n\nOffshore Decommissioning Contingency \n\nThe Company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. For information regarding potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties estimated and recorded in the third quarter of 2021, please refer to &#8220;Potential Decommissioning Obligation on Sold Properties&#8221; above and in Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in significant assumptions impacting the Company&#8217;s estimated liability, including expected decommissioning rig spread rates, lift boat rates, and planned abandonment logistics could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued. \n\nImpairment of Equity Method Interests \n\nEquity method interests are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, if the loss is deemed to be other than temporary. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income. \n\nAltus recorded an impairment charge on its equity method interest in the EPIC crude oil pipeline (EPIC) in the fourth quarter of 2021. The fair value of the impaired interest was determined using the income approach. The income approach considered estimates of future throughput volumes, tariff rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with that which would be applied by market participants. The Company has classified this nonrecurring fair value measurement as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 7&#8212;Equity Method Interests , within Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of Altus&#8217; equity method interests. \n\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments \n\nLong-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties and GPT assets, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach. \n\nUnder the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, expected throughput volumes for GPT assets, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. The Company discounts the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. \n\nTo assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available, management uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. \n\nAlthough the fair value estimate of each asset group is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods. \n\nOver the past several years, the Company has experienced substantial volatility in commodity prices, which impacted its future development plans and operating cash flows. As such, material impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, processing, and transmission facilities were recorded in 2020. For discussion of these impairments, see &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; of Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligation (ARO) \n\nThe Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Company&#8217;s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations. \n\nARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company&#8217;s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company&#8217;s oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements and tax returns. Management routinely assesses the ability to realize the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). \n\nThe Company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the Company operates. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nThe primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company&#8217;s exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how the Company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures. \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\nThe Company&#8217;s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the Company receives for its crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and global supply and demand. The Company continually monitors its market risk exposure, as oil and gas supply and demand are impacted by uncertainties in the commodity and financial markets associated with the conflict in Ukraine, global inflation, and other current events. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s average crude oil price realizations increased 44 percent to $99.39 per barrel in 2022 from $68.97 per barrel in 2021. The Company&#8217;s average natural gas price realizations increased 25 percent to $4.97 per Mcf in 2022 from $3.99 per Mcf in 2021. The Company&#8217;s average NGL price realizations increased 22 percent to $34.62 per barrel in 2022 from $28.48 per barrel in 2021. Based on average daily production for 2022, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $67 million, a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized natural gas price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $31 million, and a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized NGL price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $22 million. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Apache had $4.9 billion, net, in outstanding notes and debentures, all of which was fixed-rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.32 percent. Although near-term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, such changes do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt. \n\nThe Company is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under its syndicated credit facilities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $185 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 80 percent of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, Apache had no borrowings outstanding under APA&#8217;s syndicated revolving credit facilities. A change in the interest rate applicable to short-term investments and credit facility borrowings would have an immaterial impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. The Company&#8217;s North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, while the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. The Company&#8217;s Egypt production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions denominated in British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period. \n\nForeign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Foreign currency gains and losses are included as either a component of &#8220;Other&#8221; under &#8220;Revenues and Other&#8221; or, as is the case when the Company re-measures its foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company&#8217;s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A foreign currency net gain or loss of $3 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening, respectively, in the British pound as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START "

Riney, the Company&#8217;s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, in his capacity as principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation and as of the date of that evaluation, these officers concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, providing effective means to ensure that the information the Company is required to disclose under applicable laws and regulations is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission&#8217;s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nThe Company periodically reviews the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls, including compliance with various laws and regulations that apply to its operations, both inside and outside the United States. The Company makes modifications to improve the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls, and may take other corrective action, if the Company&#8217;s reviews identify deficiencies or weaknesses in its controls. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThe management report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the &#8220;Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,&#8221; included on Page F-1 in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. As a non-accelerated filer, the management report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is not subject to attestation by the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm. \n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ending December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. \n\n##TABLE_START "

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgments. \n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company&#8217;s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s independent auditors, Ernst &#38; Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. Ernst &#38; Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3. \n\n##TABLE_START /s/ John J.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\n##TABLE_START Depreciation, depletion and amortization of property and equipment \n\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s property and equipment was $7,957 million, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&#38;A) expense was $1,177 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, the Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. DD&#38;A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company&#8217;s internal reservoir engineers. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nF-2 \n\n##TABLE_START Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Significant judgment is required by the Company&#8217;s internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating oil and gas reserves. Estimating reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions, and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserves, management engaged independent petroleum engineers to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by the Company&#8217;s internal reservoir engineers for select properties as of December 31, 2022. \n\nAuditing the Company&#8217;s DD&#38;A calculations is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and the independent petroleum engineers and the evaluation of management&#8217;s determination of the inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s controls over its process to calculate DD&#38;A, including management&#8217;s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the engineers for use in estimating oil and gas reserves. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company&#8217;s internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and the independent petroleum engineers used to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates for select properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management&#8217;s development plan for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projections with the Company&#8217;s development plan and the availability of capital relative to the development plan. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD&#38;A calculation, including comparing the oil and gas reserve amounts used in the calculation to the Company&#8217;s reserve reports. Accounting for asset retirement obligation for the North Sea segment \n\nDescription of the Matter \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $1,991 million. As further described in Note 9, the Company&#8217;s ARO reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company&#8217;s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The estimation of the ARO related to the North Sea segment requires significant judgment given the magnitude of the expected retirement costs. \n\nAuditing the Company&#8217;s ARO for the North Sea segment is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligation. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nF-3 \n\n##TABLE_START How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management&#8217;s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. We also tested management&#8217;s controls over the completeness and accuracy of financial data used in the valuation. \n\nTo test the ARO for the North Sea segment, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, such as retirement cost estimates. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company&#8217;s estimates to recent offshore activities and costs. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates. \n\nAccounting for decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of Mexico properties \n\nDescription of the Matter \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of Mexico properties (decommissioning contingency) balance totaled $1.2 billion. As further described in Note 12, the Company&#8217;s decommissioning contingency reflects the estimated undiscounted potential liability to fund decommissioning of the sold Gulf of Mexico properties. The estimation of the decommissioning contingency requires significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty of the expected retirement costs. \n\nAuditing the Company&#8217;s decommissioning contingency is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the decommissioning contingency. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are subjective assumptions affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit \n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal controls over its decommissioning contingency estimation process, including management&#8217;s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the contingency. We also tested management&#8217;s controls over the completeness and accuracy of financial data used in the valuation. \n\nTo test the decommissioning contingency, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, such as retirement cost estimates. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company&#8217;s estimates to recent offshore activities and costs as well as current bids obtained from service providers. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002. \n\nHouston, Texas \n\nFebruary 23, 2023 \n\nF-4 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS ##TABLE_START &#160;

The Company&#8217;s upstream business has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, Apache&#8217;s midstream business was operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owned, developed, and operated a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas. \n\nOn March 1, 2021, Apache consummated a holding company reorganization (the Holding Company Reorganization), pursuant to which Apache became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation (APA), and all of Apache&#8217;s outstanding shares automatically converted into equivalent corresponding shares of APA. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, APA became the successor issuer to Apache pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act and replaced Apache as the public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;APA.&#8221; The Holding Company Reorganization modernized APA&#8217;s operating and legal structure, making it more consistent with other companies that have affiliates operating around the globe. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate for more detail. \n\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nAccounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company&#8217;s financial statements for prior periods may include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. Significant accounting policies are discussed below. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. Apache&#8217;s consolidated financial statements reflect the impacts of the Holding Company Reorganization on a prospective basis, and results prior to completion of the Holding Company Reorganization have not been restated. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate for more detail. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, it has more than a 50 percent voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent outside ownership in the net assets of a consolidated subsidiary of Apache and are reflected separately in the Company&#8217;s financial statements. \n\nIn conjunction with the ratification of a new merged concession agreement with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) in December 2021, Apache modified partnership agreements for certain consolidated subsidiaries. Apache subsequently determined that one of its limited partnership subsidiaries, which has control over Apache&#8217;s Egyptian operations, qualified as a variable interest entity (VIE) under GAAP. Apache continues to consolidate this limited partnership subsidiary because the Company has concluded that it has a controlling financial interest in the Egyptian operations and was determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. For all periods presented, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) has owned a one-third minority participation in the Company&#8217;s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest. Under the modified partnership agreements, APA owns a minority participation in the remaining two-thirds of its consolidated Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate for detail regarding APA&#8217;s noncontrolling interest. All noncontrolling interests are reflected as a separate component of equity in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. \n\nAdditionally, prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, third-party investors owned a minority interest of approximately 21 percent of Altus, which was reflected as a separate noncontrolling interest component of equity in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. ALTM qualified as a VIE under GAAP, which Apache consolidated because a wholly owned subsidiary of Apache had a controlling financial interest and was determined to be the primary beneficiary. Additionally, the assets of ALTM could only be used to settle obligations of ALTM. There was no recourse to the Company for ALTM&#8217;s liabilities. \n\nF-10 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nOn February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a previously announced transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP and, together with BCP Raptor Holdco GP, LLC, the Contributed Entities) in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement entered into by and among ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, New BCP Raptor Holdco, LLC (the Contributor), and BCP (the BCP Contribution Agreement). Pursuant to the BCP Contribution Agreement, the Contributor contributed all of the equity interests of the Contributed Entities (the Contributed Interests) to Altus Midstream LP, with each Contributed Entity becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Altus Midstream LP (the BCP Business Combination). Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. (Kinetik), and the Company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of Kinetik. The Company further determined that Kinetik no longer qualified as a VIE under GAAP. As a result, the Company deconsolidated ALTM on February 22, 2022. Refer to Note 3&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures for further detail. \n\nThe stockholders agreement entered into by and among the Company, ALTM, BCP, and other related and affiliated entities provides that the Company, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, retains the ability to designate a director to the board of directors of Kinetik for so long as the Company and its affiliates beneficially own 10 percent or more of Kinetik&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Based on this board representation, combined with the Company&#8217;s stock ownership, management determined it has significant influence over Kinetik. Investments in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded separately as &#8220;Equity method interests&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the fair value option to account for its equity method interest in Kinetik. Refer to Note 7&#8212;Equity Method Interests for further detail. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. \n\nSignificant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets (refer to &#8220;Fair Value Measurements&#8221; and &#8220;Property and Equipment&#8221; sections in this Note 1 below), the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (refer to Note 3&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures ), the fair value of equity method interests (refer to &#8220;Equity Method Interests&#8221; within this Note 1 and Note 7&#8212;Equity Method Interests ), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (refer to Note 9&#8212;Asset Retirement Obligation ), the estimate of income taxes (refer to Note 11&#8212;Income Taxes ), the estimation of the contingent liability representing Apache&#8217;s potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties in the Gulf of Mexico (refer to Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies ), and the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (refer to Note 19&#8212;Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) ). \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35, &#8220;Fair Value Measurement&#8221; (ASC 820), provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority. \n\nThe valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). \n\nF-11 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nRecurring fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 5&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , Note 7&#8212;Equity Method Intere s t s , Note 10&#8212;Debt and Financing Costs , Note 13&#8212;Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans , and Note 14&#8212;Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest &#8212; Altus . \n\nThe Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment. The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded in connection with fair value assessments: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Oil and gas proved property $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,319 &#160; Gathering, processing, and transmission facilities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 68 &#160; Equity method interests &#8212; &#160; 160 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Goodwill &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 87 &#160; Inventory and other &#8212; &#160; 48 &#160; 27 &#160; Total Impairments $ &#8212; &#160; $ 208 &#160; $ 4,501 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $ 208 million. These charges include a $ 160 million impairment on the Company&#8217;s equity method interest in the EPIC crude oil pipeline (EPIC) as part of Altus&#8217; review of the fair value of its assets in relation to the BCP Business Combination. Refer to &#8220;Equity Method Interests&#8221; within this Note 1 below and Note 3&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures for further detail on the BCP Business Combination. The Company also recorded other impairments during 2021 of approximately $ 26 million in connection with inventory valuations in Egypt and $ 22 million in connection with inventory valuations and expected equipment dispositions in the North Sea. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $ 4.5 billion in connection with non-recurring fair value assessments. Given the crude oil price collapse on lower demand and economic activity resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic and related governmental actions, the Company assessed its oil and gas property and gathering, processing, and transmission (GPT) facilities for impairment based on the net book value of its assets as of March 31, 2020. The Company recognized proved property impairments of $ 3.9 billion, $ 354 million, and $ 7 million in the U.S., Egypt, and North Sea, respectively, all of which were impaired to their estimated fair values as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices, changes to planned development activity, and increasing market uncertainty. Similarly, the Company recognized GPT facility impairments of $ 68 million in Egypt. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in &#8220;Property and Equipment - Oil and Gas Property&#8221; and &#8220;Property and Equipment - Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Facilities.&#8221; \n\nThe Company also performed an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill related to its Egypt reporting unit. Reductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties resulted in implied fair values below the carrying values of the Company&#8217;s Egypt reporting unit. As a result of these assessments, the Company recognized non-cash impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the Egypt reporting unit of $ 87 million in the first quarter of 2020. \n\nDuring the remainder of 2020, the Company recorded additional proved property impairments totaling $ 20 million in Egypt, as well as $ 13 million for the early termination of drilling rig leases, $ 5 million for inventory revaluations, and $ 9 million of other asset impairments, all in the U.S. \n\nF-12 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nUpstream \n\nThe Company&#8217;s upstream oil and gas segments primarily generate revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of its crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production volumes. In addition to Apache-related production volumes, the Company also sells commodity volumes purchased from third-parties to provide flexibility to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. Under these short-term commodity sales contracts, the physical delivery of each unit of quantity represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of the Company. Contract prices are determined based on market-indexed prices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and other market-reflective differentials. Revenue is measured by allocating an entirely variable market price to each performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. The Company considers a variety of facts and circumstances in assessing the point of control transfer, including but not limited to: whether the purchaser can direct the use of the hydrocarbons, the transfer of significant risks and rewards, and the Company&#8217;s right to payment. Control typically transfers to customers upon the physical delivery at specified locations within each contract and the transfer of title. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production-sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company&#8217;s PSCs, the Company is the contractor partner (Contractor) with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor&#8217;s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC&#8217;s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the Company&#8217;s Egypt operations despite impacting the Company&#8217;s production and reserves. Revenues related to Egypt&#8217;s tax volumes are considered revenue from a non-customer. \n\nOn December 27, 2021, the Company announced the ratification of a new merged concession agreement (MCA) with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and the EGPC, having an effective date of April 1, 2021. The MCA consolidated 98 percent of gross acreage and 90 percent of gross production under one concession agreement and refreshed the existing development lease terms for 20 years and exploration leases for 5 years. The consolidated concession has a single cost recovery pool to provide improved access to cost recovery, a fixed 40 percent cost recovery limit, and a fixed profit-sharing rate of 30 percent for all the Company&#8217;s production covered under the new concession. For all periods presented, Sinopec has owned a one-third minority participation in the Company&#8217;s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest. Under the modified partnership agreements, APA owns a minority participation in the remaining two-thirds of its consolidated Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest. \n\nRefer to Note 18&#8212;Business Segment Information for a disaggregation of revenue by product and reporting segment. \n\nAltus Midstream \n\nPrior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, the Company&#8217;s Altus Midstream segment was operated by ALTM, through its subsidiary, Altus Midstream LP. Altus generated revenue from contracts with customers from its gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services provided on the Company&#8217;s natural gas and natural gas liquid production volumes. Under these long-term commercial service contracts, providing the related service represented a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of Altus that was satisfied over time. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, Altus primarily received a fixed fee for each contract year, subject to yearly fee escalation recalculations. Revenue was primarily measured using the output method and recognized in the amount to which Altus had the right to invoice, as performance completed to date corresponded directly with the value to its customers. For the periods prior to the BCP Business Combination, Altus Midstream segment revenues were primarily attributable to sales between Altus and APA, which were fully eliminated upon consolidation. \n\nF-13 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nPayment Terms and Contract Balances \n\nPayments under all contracts with customers are typically due and received within a short-term period of one year or less, after physical delivery of the product or service has been rendered. Receivables from contracts with customers, including receivables for purchased oil and gas sales and net of allowance for credit losses, were $ 1.3 billion at each of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&#8221; variable market prices for each short-term commodity sale are allocated entirely to each performance obligation as the terms of payment relate specifically to the Company&#8217;s efforts to satisfy its obligations. As such, the Company has elected the practical expedients available under the standard to not disclose the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 185 million and $ 279 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $ 132 million of cash was held by Altus, which was deconsolidated on February 22, 2022. The Company had no restricted cash as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses \n\nAccounts receivable are stated at amortized cost net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of its financial assets measured at amortized cost. The Company monitors the credit quality of its counterparties through review of collections, credit ratings, and other analyses. The Company develops its estimated allowance for expected credit losses primarily using an aging method and analyses of historical loss rates as well as consideration of current and future conditions that could impact its counterparties&#8217; credit quality and liquidity. \n\nThe following table presents changes to the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit loss: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Allowance for credit loss at beginning of year $ 109 &#160; $ 95 &#160; $ 88 &#160; Additional provisions for the year 9 &#160; 19 &#160; 7 &#160; Uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries ( 1 ) ( 5 ) &#8212; &#160; Allowance for credit loss at end of year $ 117 &#160; $ 109 &#160; $ 95 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nReceivable from / Payable to APA \n\nReceivable from or payable to APA represents the net result of Apache&#8217;s administrative and support services provided to APA and other miscellaneous cash management transactions to be settled between the two affiliated entities. Cash will be transferred to Apache or paid to APA over time in order to manage affiliate balances for cash management purposes. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate for more detail. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment and are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Oil produced but not sold, primarily in the North Sea, is also recorded to inventory and is stated at the lower of the cost to produce or net realizable value. \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nThe carrying value of the Company&#8217;s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations and acquisitions, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date. \n\nF-14 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nOil and Gas Property \n\nThe Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. \n\nAcquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company&#8217;s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations. \n\nCosts to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the carrying value of associated proved oil and gas properties. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to calculate the depreciation for capitalized well costs is the sum of proved developed reserves only. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost. \n\nOil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932, &#8220;Extractive Activities&#8212;Oil and Gas.&#8221; The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. \n\nWhen circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on the Company&#8217;s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in ASC 820. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments, a Level 3 fair value measurement. \n\nThe significant decline in crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as longer-term commodity price outlooks, related to reduced demand for oil and natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions indicated possible impairment of the Company&#8217;s proved and unproved oil and gas properties in early 2020. In addition to estimating risk-adjusted reserves and future production volumes, estimated future commodity prices are the largest driver in variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. Expected cash flows were estimated based on management&#8217;s views of published West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent, and Henry Hub forward pricing as of the balance sheet dates. Other significant assumptions and inputs used to calculate estimated future cash flows include estimates for future development activity, exploration plans and remaining lease terms. A 10 percent discount rate, based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital estimate, was applied to the undiscounted cash flow estimate to value all of the Company&#8217;s asset groups that were subject to impairment charges in 2020. \n\nF-15 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nThe following table represents non-cash impairments charges of the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s proved and unproved properties: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Proved properties: U.S. $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 3,938 &#160; Egypt &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 374 &#160; North Sea &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; Total proved properties $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 4,319 &#160; Unproved properties: U.S. $ 20 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 92 &#160; Egypt 4 &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; North Sea &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Total unproved properties $ 24 &#160; $ 31 &#160; $ 101 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nProved properties impaired had an aggregate fair value as of the most recent date of impairment of $ 1.9 billion for 2020. \n\nGains and losses on divestitures of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas properties are recognized in the statement of consolidated operations upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 3&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures for more detail. \n\nGathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT) Facilities \n\nGPT facilities totaled $ 449 million and $ 673 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling $ 367 million and $ 386 million for the respective periods. As a result of the BCP Business Combination, the Company deconsolidated $ 183 million of Altus GPT net assets on February 22, 2022. GPT facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GPT assets, whether Apache-operated or third party-operated, as well as potential development plans by the Company for undeveloped acreage within, or close to, those fields. \n\nThe Company assesses the carrying amount of its GPT facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. \n\nThe Company assessed its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment as of March 31, 2020, and recorded an impairment of $ 68 million on its GPT facilities in Egypt during the first quarter of 2020. The fair values of the impaired assets, which were determined to be $ 46 million, were estimated using the income approach, which considers internal estimates based on future throughput volumes from applicable development concessions in Egypt and estimated costs to operate. These assumptions were applied based on throughput assumptions developed in relation to the oil and gas proved property impairment assessment, as discussed above, to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a 10 percent discount rate, based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital estimate. The Company has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nOther Property and Equipment \n\nOther property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land, and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 20 years. Other property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation totaled $ 206 million and $ 225 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nF-16 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nAsset Retirement Costs and Obligations \n\nThe initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment and subsequent revisions are recorded as a liability at fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset&#8217;s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets. \n\nCapitalized Interest \n\nFor significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company&#8217;s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation. \n\nGoodwill \n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company currently carries no goodwill, but, in comparative periods, it was recorded in &#8220;Deferred charges and other&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company assessed the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arose. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. The Company assessed each country as a reporting unit, with Egypt being the only reporting unit to have associated goodwill during the periods presented. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the book value, including goodwill, then goodwill was written down to its implied fair value through a charge to expense. \n\nReductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties during 2020 resulted in implied fair values below the carrying values of the Company&#8217;s Egypt reporting unit. As a result of this assessment, the Company recognized non-cash impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the Egypt reporting unit of $ 87 million in 2020. This goodwill impairment was recorded in &#8220;Impairments&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. The Company has no goodwill recognized as of December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. \n\nF-17 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nEquity Method Interests \n\nThe Company follows the equity method of accounting when it does not exercise control over its equity interests, but can exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the entity. Under this method, the equity interests are carried originally at acquisition cost, increased by the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the equity interest&#8217;s net income and contributions made by the Company, and decreased by the Company&#8217;s proportionate share of the equity interest&#8217;s net losses and distributions received by the Company. \n\nEquity method interests are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, if the loss is deemed to be other than temporary. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income. Prior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Altus, as part of its review of the fair value of its assets in relation to the BCP Business Combination, determined the current fair value of its investment in EPIC was below carrying value. Altus subsequently determined that this loss in value to be other than temporary. As such, in the fourth quarter of 2021, Altus recorded an impairment charge of $ 160 million on its equity method interest in EPIC. The fair value of the impaired interest was determined using the income approach. The income approach considered estimates of future throughput volumes, tariff rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a discount rate believed to be consistent with that which would be applied by market participants. Altus classified this nonrecurring fair value measurement as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 7&#8212;Equity Method Interests for further details of the Company&#8217;s equity method interests. \n\nCommitments and Contingencies \n\nAccruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. For more information regarding loss contingencies, refer to Note 12&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies . \n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nThe Company periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price, interest rate, and/or foreign exchange risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options. \n\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, are recorded on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current-period income as &#8220;Derivative instrument gains (losses), net&#8221; under &#8220;Revenues and Other&#8221; in the statement of consolidated operations. Refer to Note 5&#8212;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nApache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws. \n\nApache is a directly owned subsidiary of APA Corporation and is included in APA Corporation and Subsidiaries&#8217; U.S. Federal income tax return. The Company&#8217;s financial statements recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences that result from Apache&#8217;s activities during the current period pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740 &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; as if the Company were a separate taxpayer rather than a member of APA Corporation&#8217;s consolidated income tax return group. \n\nF-18 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nPrior to consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Apache granted various types of stock-based awards including stock options, restricted stock, cash-settled restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Stock compensation equity awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed over the required vesting service period. Cash-settled awards are recorded as a liability based on APA&#8217;s stock price and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation plans, which were assumed by APA pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 15&#8212;Capital Stock . \n\nTransaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS) \n\nIn recent years, the Company streamlined its portfolio through strategic divestitures and centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies and cost savings through shared services. In light of the continued streamlining of the Company&#8217;s asset portfolio through divestitures and strategic transactions, in late 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of the Company&#8217;s organizational structure and operations. Efforts related to this organization were substantially completed during 2020. The Company incurred and paid a cumulative total of $ 79 million of reorganization costs through December 31, 2020. An additional $ 15 million and $ 17 million of reorganization costs were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to ongoing consulting and separation activities in the Company&#8217;s international operations. \n\nThe Company recorded $ 26 million, $ 22 million, and $ 54 million of TRS costs in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. TRS costs incurred in 2022 comprised $ 15 million related to the reorganization, including $ 9 million for consulting costs and $ 6 million of separation costs, and $ 11 million for costs associated with the BCP Business Combination. TRS costs incurred in 2021 comprised $ 17 million related to the reorganization, including $ 11 million for consulting costs and $ 6 million of separation costs, and $ 5 million for costs associated with the BCP Business Combination. TRS costs incurred in 2020 relate to $ 51 million of separation costs associated with the reorganization, $ 2 million for transaction consulting fees, and $ 1 million of office closure costs. \n\n2. TRANSACTIONS WITH PARENT AFFILIATE \n\nThe Company completed the Holding Company Reorganization on March 1, 2021, and sold to APA all of the equity in the three Apache subsidiaries through which Apache&#8217;s interests in Suriname and the Dominican Republic were held. The Company accounted for the divestiture of its subsidiaries as a transfer to an affiliate entity under common control and no longer consolidates the subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the Holding Company Reorganization. The carrying value of the net assets transferred was $ 483 million, which included approximately $ 292 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 163 million of oil and gas properties, and working capital items. The Company continues to hold its existing assets in the U.S., Egypt, and the U.K. \n\nThe Holding Company Reorganization gave rise to a note payable by APA to Apache. The note has a seven-year term, maturing on February 29, 2028, and bears interest at a rate of 4.5 percent per annum, payable semi-annually, subject to APA&#8217;s option to allow accrued interest to convert to principal (PIK) during the first 5.5 years of the note&#8217;s term (to August 31, 2026). The note is guaranteed by each of the three subsidiaries sold by Apache to APA. The Company recognized interest income on this note of $ 63 million and $ 51 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The interest income related to this note is reflected in &#8220;Financing costs, net&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. Apache allowed interest accrued from March 1, 2021 through August 31, 2022, totaling $ 93 million, to PIK pursuant to the note. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, in conjunction with the ratification of a new merged concession agreement (MCA) with EGPC, Apache entered into an agreement with APA under which the historical value of existing concessions prior to ratifying the MCA was retained by Apache, with any excess value from the MCA terms being allocated to APA. Sinopec owns a one-third minority participation in the Company&#8217;s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business, and a portion of the remaining net income and distributable cash flow is allocated to APA in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In 2022, approximately 30 percent of the remaining net income and distributable cash flow for the Company&#8217;s Egyptian operations was allocated to APA. Apache consolidates its Egyptian operations, with noncontrolling interests reflected as a separate component in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. During 2022, the Company recorded net income attributable to APA&#8217;s noncontrolling interest of $ 278 million, and distributed $ 216 million of cash to APA in association with its noncontrolling interest. \n\nF-19 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nThe Company continues to provide administrative and support operations for certain APA subsidiaries with interest in the U.S., Suriname, and the Dominican Republic. The Company is reimbursed by APA for employee costs, certain internal costs, and third-party costs paid by the Company in connection with its role as service provider. All reimbursements are based on actual costs incurred, and no market premium is applied by the Company to APA. The Company incurred $ 18 million and $ 17 million in reimbursable corporate overhead charges during 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nIn August 2021, Apache entered into a promissory note with APA under which Apache could borrow up to $ 250 million from APA at APA&#8217;s discretion. The note had a term of one year and bore interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the monthly, short-term applicable federal rate, payable semi-annually. As of December 31, 2021, there was $ 195 million outstanding under this note, which was reflected as &#8220;Note payable to APA Corporation&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. All remaining borrowings were fully repaid prior to maturity on August 4, 2022. \n\nIn April 2022, Apache made a promissory note payable to APA in the original principal amount of $ 680 million. Apache made the note in consideration for APA&#8217;s assumption under its U.S. dollar denominated syndicated facility on April, 29, 2022 of Apache&#8217;s borrowings outstanding upon the simultaneous termination of its 2018 syndicated facility, as described in Note 10&#8212;Debt and Financing Costs . The non-interest-bearing note had a term of one year , maturing on April 28, 2023, and was fully repaid by September 30, 2022. Apache repaid $ 331 million on the note during the second quarter of 2022 and the remaining $ 349 million during the third quarter of 2022. \n\nReceivable from APA Corporation, totaling $ 869 million and $ 77 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represents the net result of Apache&#8217;s administrative and support services provided to APA and other miscellaneous cash management transactions to be settled between the two affiliated entities. Cash will be transferred to Apache over time in order to manage affiliate balances for cash management purposes. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company may, at its discretion, make distributions of capital to APA Corporation. During 2022, the Company made capital distributions totaling $ 894 million, primarily in support of APA Corporation&#8217;s share repurchase program, dividend payments made by APA, and distributions for APA&#8217;s noncontrolling interest during the period. During 2021, the Company made capital distributions totaling $ 839 million related to dividend payments made by APA. \n\n3. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES \n\n2022 Activity \n\nDuring 2022, the Company completed other leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of approximately $ 37 million. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company completed the sale of non-core assets and leasehold in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $ 52 million, recognizing a gain of approximately $ 36 million, upon closing of these transactions. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed a previously announced transaction to sell certain non-core mineral rights in the Delaware Basin. The Company received total cash proceeds of approximately $ 726 million after certain post-closing adjustments and recognized an associated gain of approximately $ 560 million. \n\nThe BCP Business Combination was completed on February 22, 2022. As consideration for the contribution of the Contributed Interests, ALTM issued 50 million shares of Class C Common Stock (and Altus Midstream LP issued a corresponding number of common units) to BCP&#8217;s unitholders, which are principally funds affiliated with Blackstone and I Squared Capital. ALTM&#8217;s stockholders continued to hold their existing shares of common stock. As a result of the transaction, the Contributor, or its designees, collectively owned approximately 75 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock. Apache Midstream LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of APA, which owned approximately 79 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock prior to the BCP Business Combination, owned approximately 20 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Kinetik common stock after the transaction closed. \n\nAs a result of the BCP Business Combination, the Company deconsolidated ALTM on February 22, 2022 and recognized a gain of approximately $ 609 million that reflects the difference between the Company&#8217;s share of ALTM&#8217;s deconsolidated balance sheet and the fair value of its approximate 20 percent retained ownership in the combined entity. A summary of components of the gain, including the ALTM balance sheet amounts deconsolidated at the time of close, is included below: \n\nF-20 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n##TABLE_START As of February 22, 2022 (In millions) Fair value of Kinetik Class A Common Stock held by Company $ 802 &#160; ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 143 &#160; Other current assets 29 &#160; Property and equipment, net 184 &#160; Equity method interests 1,367 &#160; Other noncurrent assets 12 &#160; Total assets deconsolidated $ 1,735 &#160; LIABILITIES: Current liabilities $ 3 &#160; Long-term debt 657 &#160; Other noncurrent liabilities 168 &#160; Total liabilities deconsolidated $ 828 &#160; NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS: Redeemable noncontrolling interest preferred unit limited partners $ 642 &#160; Noncontrolling interest-Altus 72 &#160; Total noncontrolling interests deconsolidated $ 714 &#160; Net effect of deconsolidating balance sheet $ ( 193 ) Gain on deconsolidation of ALTM $ 609 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold four million of its shares of Kinetik Class A Common Stock for cash proceeds of $ 224 million and recognized a loss of $ 25 million, including transaction fees. Refer to Note 7&#8212;Equity Method Interests for further detail. In connection with this secondary offering, the Company agreed that, within 24 months of closing the offering, it will invest a minimum of $ 100 million of the proceeds of the offering for new well drilling and completion activity at the Alpine High play in the Delaware Basin, where Kinetik has exclusive gas and NGL gathering and processing rights. The Company has invested approximately half of this commitment as of year-end 2022. \n\n2021 Activity \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the Company completed the sale of certain non-core assets in the Permian Basin with a net carrying value of $ 157 million for cash proceeds of $ 176 million and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $ 44 million. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $ 63 million in connection with the sale. \n\nDuring 2021, the Company also completed the sale of other non-core assets and leasehold, primarily in the Permian Basin, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $ 80 million. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $ 4 million upon closing of these transactions. \n\nDuring 2021, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $ 9 million. \n\nF-21 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n2020 Activity \n\nDuring 2020, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $ 4 million. Also during 2020, the Company completed the sale of certain non-core assets and leasehold, primarily in the Permian Basin, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $ 87 million, and recognized a gain of $ 13 million. The Company also recognized a gain of $ 19 million during 2020 in connection with a joint venture agreement with TotalEnergies (formerly Total S.A.) to explore and develop Block 58 offshore Suriname. \n\n4. CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS \n\nThe following summarizes the changes in capitalized exploratory well costs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Additions pending the determination of proved reserves excludes amounts capitalized and subsequently charged to expense within the same year. \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Capitalized well costs at beginning of year $ 46 &#160; $ 197 &#160; $ 141 &#160; Additions pending determination of proved reserves 138 &#160; 62 &#160; 226 &#160; Divestitures and other &#8212; &#160; ( 163 ) ( 38 ) Reclassifications to proved properties ( 110 ) ( 40 ) ( 56 ) Charged to exploration expense ( 24 ) ( 10 ) ( 76 ) Capitalized well costs at end of year $ 50 &#160; $ 46 &#160; $ 197 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following provides an aging of capitalized exploratory well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling as of December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 (In millions) Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period of one year or less $ 34 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 184 &#160; Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year 16 &#160; 33 &#160; 13 &#160; Capitalized well costs at end of year $ 50 &#160; $ 46 &#160; $ 197 &#160; Number of projects with exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year 10 &#160; 9 &#160; 5 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nProjects with suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling are those identified by management as exhibiting sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons to justify potential development. Management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects. Suspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling were $ 16 million at December 31, 2022. The remaining projects pertain to onshore drilling activity in Egypt for which continued testing and evaluation is ongoing. \n\nDry hole expenses from suspended exploratory well costs previously capitalized for greater than one year at December 31, 2021 totaled $ 24 million. These expenses pertain to projects in the North Sea where development is no longer progressing. \n\nThe following table summarizes aging by geographic area of those exploratory well costs that, as of December 31, 2022, have been capitalized for a period greater than one year, categorized by the year in which drilling was completed: \n\n##TABLE_START Total 2021 2020 2019 and Prior (In millions) Egypt $ 14 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9 &#160; North Sea 2 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ 16 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-22 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n5. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES \n\nObjectives and Strategies \n\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates in connection with transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production and foreign currency transactions. The Company may utilize various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices or foreign currency values. \n\nIn December 2022, counterparty agreements for Apache&#8217;s commodity derivative instruments were transferred from Apache to APA Corporation. As of the dates of transfer, Apache&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet reflected derivative liabilities totaling $ 37 million, which represented the fair values of the commodity derivative instruments on those dates. The resulting impacts of the transfer to APA Corporation were the realization of the mark-to-market loss of $ 37 million on Apache&#8217;s statement of consolidated operation and the derecognition of open derivative positions on Apache&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Apache had no outstanding derivative positions as of December 31, 2022. \n\nEmbedded Derivatives \n\nAltus Preferred Units Embedded Derivative \n\nThe Altus Preferred Units embedded derivative was deconsolidated as of March 31, 2022 as part of the BCP Business Combination. Refer to Note 3 &#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures for discussion of the BCP Business Combination and Note 14&#8212;Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest &#8212; Altus for a description of the Altus Preferred Units and associated embedded derivative. \n\nPipeline Capacity Embedded Derivatives \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, the Company entered into agreements to assign a portion of its contracted capacity under an existing transportation agreement to third parties. Embedded in these agreements were arrangements under which the Company received payments calculated based on pricing differentials between Houston Ship Channel and Waha during the calendar years 2020 and 2021. This feature required bifurcation and measurement of the change in market value throughout 2020 and 2021. Unrealized gains and losses in the fair value of this feature were recorded as &#8220;Derivative instrument gains (losses), net&#8221; under &#8220;Revenues and Other&#8221; in the statement of consolidated operations, and the balance at the end of December 31, 2021 will be amortized into income over the original tenure of the host contract. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe following table presents the Company&#8217;s derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: \n\n##TABLE_START Fair Value Measurements Using Quoted Price in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Fair Value Netting (1) \n\nCarrying Amount (In millions) December 31, 2022 Assets: Commodity derivative instruments $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Liabilities: Commodity derivative instruments $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; December 31, 2021 Liabilities: Commodity derivative instruments $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10 &#160; Pipeline capacity embedded derivatives &#8212; &#160; 46 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 46 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 46 &#160; Preferred Units embedded derivative &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 57 &#160; 57 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 57 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Derivative fair values were based on analysis of each contract on a gross basis, excluding the impact of netting agreements with counterparties and reclassifications between long-term and short-term balances. \n\nF-23 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nThe fair values of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments were not actively quoted in the open market. The Company primarily used a market approach to estimate the fair values of these derivatives on a recurring basis, utilizing futures pricing for the underlying positions provided by a reputable third party, a Level 2 fair value measurement. \n\nDerivative Activity Recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \n\nAll derivative instruments were reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. These fair values were recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contained provisions for net settlement.

EQUITY METHOD INTERESTS \n\nThe Kinetik Class A Common Stock held by the Company is treated as an interest in equity securities measured at fair value. The Company elected the fair value option for measuring its equity method interest in Kinetik based on practical expedience, variances in reporting timelines, and cost-benefit considerations. The fair value of the Company&#8217;s interest in Kinetik is determined using observable share prices on a major exchange, a Level 1 fair value measurement. Fair value adjustments and dividends received are recorded as a component of &#8220;Other, net&#8221; under &#8220;Revenues and other&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. \n\nThe initial interest in Kinetik was measured at fair value based on the Company&#8217;s ownership of approximately 12.9 million shares of Kinetik Class A Common stock as of February 22, 2022. In March 2022, the Company sold four million of its shares of Kinetik Class A Common Stock for a loss, including underwriters fees, of $ 25 million, which was recorded as a component of &#8220;Gain on divestitures, net&#8221; under &#8220;Revenues and other&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. Refer to Note 3&#8211;Acquisitions and Divestitures for further detail. \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, Kinetik issued a two -for-one split of its Common Stock. Also during 2022, the Company received approximately 1.1 million shares of Kinetik&#8217;s Class A Common Stock as paid-in-kind dividends. Finally, in 2022, the Company recorded fair value adjustments on its ownership in Kinetik totaling a gain of approximately $ 32 million. The Company&#8217;s ownership of 18.9 million shares represented approximately 13 percent of Kinetik&#8217;s outstanding Class A Common Stock as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe following table presents the activity in the Company&#8217;s equity method interest in Kinetik for the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Kinetik Holdings Inc (In millions) \n\nBalance at December 31, 2021 \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; Initial interest upon closing the BCP Business Combination 802 &#160; Sale of Class A shares ( 250 ) Paid-in-kind dividend 40 &#160; Fair value adjustments 32 &#160; \n\nBalance at December 31, 2022 \n\n$ 624 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2022, the Company recorded GPT costs for midstream services provided by Kinetik subsequent to the close of the BCP Business Combination transaction totaling $ 91 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded accrued GPT costs payable to Kinetik of approximately $ 17 million. In addition, the Company sold natural gas and NGLs to Kinetik during 2022 totaling $ 8 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded accrued receivables from Kinetik of approximately $ 8 million. \n\nPrior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, the Company, through its ownership of Altus, had the following equity method interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities, which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting at December 31, 2021. For each of the equity method interests, Altus had the ability to exercise significant influence based on certain governance provisions and its participation in activities and decisions that impact the management and economic performance of the equity method interests.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION \n\nThe following table describes changes to the Company&#8217;s asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 &#160; (In millions) Asset retirement obligation at beginning of the year $ 2,130 &#160; $ 1,944 &#160; Liabilities incurred 4 &#160; 3 &#160; Liabilities divested ( 73 ) ( 44 ) Liabilities settled ( 39 ) ( 32 ) Accretion expense 117 &#160; 113 &#160; Revisions in estimated liabilities ( 148 ) 146 &#160; Asset retirement obligation at end of the year 1,991 &#160; 2,130 &#160; Less current portion ( 55 ) ( 41 ) Asset retirement obligation, long-term $ 1,936 &#160; $ 2,089 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company&#8217;s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property or other long-lived asset balance. \n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 4 million and $ 3 million, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from the Company&#8217;s exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period. During 2022, net abandonment costs were revised downward approximately $ 148 million to reflect changes in estimates of timing, activity costs, and foreign currency exchange rates on service costs, primarily in the North Sea. This downward revision was partially offset by an upward revision in the U.S. During 2021, approximately $ 146 million net abandonment costs were revised upward to reflect changes in estimates of higher activity costs and long-term inflation assumptions, primarily in the U.S. \n\n10. DEBT AND FINANCING COSTS \n\nOverview \n\nThe debt of Apache is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. All indentures of Apache for the notes and debentures described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache&#8217;s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens. Certain of these indentures also restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and give holders the option to require the Company to repurchase outstanding notes and debentures upon certain changes in control. None of the indentures contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. \n\nOn August 17, 2020, Apache closed offerings of $ 1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $ 500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625 % notes due 2025 and $ 750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875 % notes due 2027. The senior unsecured notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache&#8217;s option, at the applicable redemption price. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under Apache&#8217;s former senior revolving credit facility, and for general corporate purposes. \n\nOn August 18, 2020, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $ 644 million aggregate principal amount of certain notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate cash purchase price of $ 644 million, reflecting principal, aggregate discount to par of $ 38 million, early tender premium of $ 32 million, and accrued and unpaid interest of $ 6 million. The Company recorded a net gain of $ 2 million on extinguishment of debt, including an acceleration of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, in connection with the note purchases. \n\nF-27 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nDuring 2020, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $ 588 million for an aggregate purchase price of $ 428 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $ 168 million. These repurchases resulted in a $ 158 million net gain on extinguishment of debt. The net gain includes an acceleration of related discount and debt issuance costs. Additionally, on November 3, 2020, Apache redeemed the remaining $ 183 million of outstanding 3.625 % senior notes due February 1, 2021 at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The repurchases were financed by borrowings under Apache&#8217;s former revolving credit facility. \n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2021, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes, accepting for purchase $ 1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate cash purchase price of $ 1.8 billion, reflecting principal, premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a $ 105 million loss on extinguishment of debt, including $ 11 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, in connection with the note purchases. \n\nDuring 2021, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $ 22 million for an aggregate purchase price of $ 20 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $ 2 million. The Company recognized a $ 1 million net gain on extinguishment of debt as part of these transactions. \n\nOn January 18, 2022, Apache redeemed the outstanding $ 213 million principal amount of 3.25 % senior notes due April 15, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption was financed by borrowing under Apache&#8217;s former revolving credit facility. \n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes issued under its indentures, accepting for purchase $ 1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Apache paid holders an aggregate $ 1.2 billion in cash, reflecting principal, premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a $ 66 million loss on extinguishment of debt, including $ 11 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs in connection with the note purchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache&#8217;s former revolving credit facility. \n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2022, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $ 15 million for an aggregate purchase price of $ 16 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a premium to par of $ 1 million. The Company recognized a $ 1 million loss on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache&#8217;s former revolving credit facility. \n\nOn October 17, 2022, Apache redeemed the outstanding $ 123 million outstanding principal amount of 2.625 % notes due January 15, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption was financed in part by Apache&#8217;s borrowing under the U.S. dollar-denominated revolving credit facility of APA Corporation described below. \n\nApache intends to reduce debt outstanding under its indentures from time to time. \n\nThe Company records gains and losses on extinguishment of debt in &#8220;Financing costs, net&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. \n\nF-28 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 &#160; (In millions) \n\n3.25 % notes due 2022 (1) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 213 &#160; \n\n2.625 % notes due 2023 (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 123 &#160; \n\n4.625 % notes due 2025 (3) \n\n51 &#160; 500 &#160; \n\n7.7 % notes due 2026 \n\n78 &#160; 79 &#160; \n\n7.95 % notes due 2026 \n\n132 &#160; 133 &#160; \n\n4.875 % due 2027 (3) \n\n108 &#160; 378 &#160; \n\n4.375 % notes due 2028 (3) \n\n325 &#160; 703 &#160; \n\n7.75 % notes due 2029 (3)(4) \n\n235 &#160; 235 &#160; \n\n4.25 % notes due 2030 (3) \n\n579 &#160; 580 &#160; \n\n6.0 % notes due 2037 (3) \n\n443 &#160; 443 &#160; \n\n5.1 % notes due 2040 (3) \n\n1,333 &#160; 1,333 &#160; \n\n5.25 % notes due 2042 (3) \n\n399 &#160; 399 &#160; \n\n4.75 % notes due 2043 (3) \n\n428 &#160; 428 &#160; \n\n4.25 % notes due 2044 (3) \n\n221 &#160; 221 &#160; \n\n7.375 % debentures due 2047 \n\n150 &#160; 150 &#160; \n\n5.35 % notes due 2049 (3) \n\n387 &#160; 387 &#160; \n\n7.625 % debentures due 2096 \n\n39 &#160; 39 &#160; Notes and debentures before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (5) \n\n4,908 &#160; 6,344 &#160; \n\nAltus credit facility (6) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 657 &#160; \n\nSyndicated credit facilities (6)(7) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 542 &#160; Finance lease obligations 34 &#160; 36 &#160; Unamortized discount ( 27 ) ( 30 ) Debt issuance costs ( 28 ) ( 39 ) Total debt 4,887 &#160; 7,510 &#160; Current maturities ( 2 ) ( 215 ) Long-term debt $ 4,885 &#160; $ 7,295 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) On January 18, 2022, Apache redeemed the 3.25 % senior notes due April 15, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. \n\n(2) On October 17, 2022, Apache redeemed the 2.625 % notes due January 15, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. \n\n(3) These notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache&#8217;s option, subject to a make-whole premium, except that the 7.75 % notes due 2029 are only redeemable as whole for principal and accrued interest in the event of certain Canadian tax law changes.

The Company uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its notes and debentures using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (a Level 2 fair value measurement). \n\n(6) The carrying amount of borrowings on credit facilities approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. \n\n(7) Although Apache had no borrowings under APA&#8217;s syndicated credit facilities as of December 31, 2022, Apache currently is a guarantor of obligations under those facilities. \n\nMaturities for the Company&#8217;s notes and debentures excluding discount and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; (In millions) 2023 $ &#8212; &#160; 2024 &#8212; &#160; 2025 51 &#160; 2026 210 &#160; 2027 108 &#160; Thereafter 4,539 &#160; Notes and debentures, excluding discounts and debt issuance costs $ 4,908 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-29 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nUncommitted Lines of Credit \n\nThe Company from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2022, there were &#163; 199 million and $ 17 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2021, there were &#163; 117 million and $ 17 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. \n\nUnsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities \n\nOn April 29, 2022, Apache entered into two unsecured guaranties of obligations under two unsecured syndicated credit agreements then entered into by APA Corporation (APA), of which Apache is a wholly owned subsidiary. APA&#8217;s new credit agreements are for general corporate purposes and replaced and refinanced Apache&#8217;s 2018 syndicated credit agreement (the Former Facility). \n\n&#8226; One credit agreement is denominated in US dollars (the USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of US$ 1.8 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$ 750 million, of which US$ 150 million currently is committed). APA may increase commitments up to an aggregate US$ 2.3 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. This facility matures in April 2027, subject to APA&#8217;s two , one-year extension options. \n\n&#8226; The second credit agreement is denominated in pounds sterling (the GBP Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of &#163; 1.5 billion for loans and letters of credit. This facility matures in April 2027, subject to APA&#8217;s two , one-year extension options. \n\nIn connection with APA&#8217;s entry into the USD Agreement and the GBP Agreement (each, a New Agreement), Apache terminated US$ 4.0 billion of commitments under the Former Facility, borrowings then outstanding under the Former Facility were deemed outstanding under APA&#8217;s USD Agreement, and letters of credit then outstanding under the Former Facility were deemed outstanding under a New Agreement, depending upon whether denominated in US dollars or pounds sterling. Apache may borrow under the USD Agreement up to an aggregate principal amount of US$ 300 million outstanding at any given time. Apache has guaranteed obligations under each New Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache&#8217;s existing indentures is less than US$ 1.0 billion. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were $ 566 million of borrowings and a $ 20 million letter of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement, and an aggregate &#163; 652 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there were $ 542 million of borrowings and an aggregate &#163; 748 million and $ 20 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Former Facility. The letters of credit denominated in pounds were issued to support North Sea decommissioning obligations, the terms of which required such support after Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s reduced Apache&#8217;s credit rating from BBB to BB+ on March 26, 2020. \n\nAll borrowings under the USD Agreement bear interest at one of two per annum rate options selected by the borrower, being either an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin ranging from 0.10 % to 0.675 % (Base Rate Margin), or an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 1.10 % to 1.675 % (Applicable Margin). All borrowings under the GBP Agreement bear interest at an adjusted rate per annum determined by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index Average published by the Bank of England, plus the Applicable Margin. Each New Agreement also requires the borrower to pay quarterly a facility fee on total commitments. Margins and facility fees are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). As of December 31, 2022, Apache&#8217;s Long-Term Debt Rating applied, and the Base Rate Margin was 0.60 %, the Applicable Margin was 1.60 %, and the facility fee was 0.275 %. \n\nA commission is payable quarterly to lenders under each New Agreement on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect. Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks. \n\nBorrowers under each New Agreement, which may include certain subsidiaries of APA, may borrow, prepay, and reborrow loans and obtain letters of credit, and APA may obtain letters of credit for the account of its subsidiaries, in each case subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default substantially similar to those in the Former Facility, such as: \n\nF-30 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n&#8226; A financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital continues to exclude the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015. At December 31, 2022, APA&#8217;s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under each New Agreement was 21 percent. \n\n&#8226; A negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U. S. and Canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics&#8217; liens. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of APA&#8217;s consolidated net tangible assets or approximately $ 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. \n\n&#8226; Negative covenants restrict APA&#8217;s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower&#8217;s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold. \n\n&#8226; Lenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if a borrower or certain subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of a borrower or certain subsidiaries. \n\nConsistent with the Former Facility, the New Agreements do not require collateral, do not have a borrowing base, do not permit lenders to accelerate maturity or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes, and do not have borrowing restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. \n\nApache was in compliance with applicable terms of each New Agreement as of December 31, 2022. \n\nIn November 2018, Altus and its subsidiary, Altus Midstream LP (Altus LP), were subsidiaries of Apache, and Altus LP entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. The agreement for the facility, as amended, provided aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of $ 800 million, including a letter of credit subfacility. The credit facility was not guaranteed by APA, Apache, or any of APA&#8217;s other subsidiaries. On February 22, 2022, Altus was deconsolidated from APA and Apache. As of December 31, 2021, there were $ 657 million of borrowings and $ 2 million letters of credit outstanding under the facility. \n\nFinancing Costs, Net \n\nThe following table presents the components of the Company&#8217;s financing costs, net: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Interest expense $ 312 &#160; $ 419 &#160; $ 438 &#160; Amortization of debt issuance costs 7 &#160; 8 &#160; 8 &#160; Capitalized interest ( 1 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 12 ) Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 67 &#160; 104 &#160; ( 160 ) Interest income ( 9 ) ( 8 ) ( 7 ) Interest income from APA Corporation, net ( 63 ) ( 51 ) &#8212; &#160; Financing costs, net $ 313 &#160; $ 472 &#160; $ 267 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 28 million of debt issuance costs, which will be charged to financing costs over the life of the related debt issuances.

Refer to Note 3&#8212; Acquisitions and Divestitures for further detail. \n\nF-33 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nOn May 26, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a new tax (the Energy Profits Levy) on the profits of oil and gas companies operating in the U.K. and the U.K. Continental Shelf. Under the new law, an additional levy is assessed at a 25 percent rate and is effective for the period of May 26, 2022, through December 31, 2025. The Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $ 208 million associated with the remeasurement of the U.K. deferred tax liability. On November 17, 2022, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Autumn Statement 2022 further changes to the Energy Profits Levy, increasing the levy assessed from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2028. On November 22, 2022, the U.K. Government published draft legislation to implement this change, among other provisions, and on January 10, 2023, the Finance Act 2023 was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. Under U.S. GAAP, the financial statement impact of new legislation is recorded in the period of enactment. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2023, the Company expects to record a deferred tax expense of approximately $ 170 million to $ 190 million related to the remeasurement of the December 31, 2022 U.K. deferred tax liability. \n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA includes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. The Corporate AMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the provisions of the IRA and awaits further guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department to properly assess the impact of these provisions on the Company. \n\nThe Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of negative evidence evaluated was the U.S. pre-tax book cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. This cumulative loss was primarily the result of low commodity prices and oil and gas impairments during this period. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company&#8217;s projections for future growth. \n\nHowever, given the Company&#8217;s current and anticipated future domestic earnings, the Company believes that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months the U.S. will exit its cumulative loss, allowing the Company to reach a conclusion that a material portion of the U.S. valuation allowance may no longer be needed. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense, which could be material for the period the release is recorded. \n\nIn 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company&#8217;s valuation allowance decreased by $ 1.0 billion, decreased by $ 116 million, and increased by $ 1.0 billion, respectively, as detailed in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 5,875 &#160; $ 5,991 &#160; $ 4,959 &#160; State (1) \n\n( 111 ) 1 &#160; 67 &#160; U.S. ( 706 ) ( 112 ) 960 &#160; Foreign ( 227 ) ( 5 ) 5 &#160; Balance at end of year $ 4,831 &#160; $ 5,875 &#160; $ 5,991 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Reported as a component of state income taxes. \n\nOn December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating losses as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Amount Expiration &#160; (In millions) &#160; U.S. $ 7,968 &#160; 2027 - Indefinite State 6,505 &#160; Various ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company has a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $ 8.0 billion, which includes $ 82 million of net operating loss subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after 2017 are subject to an 80 percent taxable income limitation with indefinite carryover under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company also has state net operating losses of $ 6.5 billion, a net interest expense carryover of $ 246 million under Section 163(j) of the Code subject to indefinite carryover, and a U.S. capital loss carryforward of $ 1.6 billion, which has a five year carryover period expiring between 2023-2027. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net operating losses, the state net operating losses, the net interest expense carryover, and the U.S. capital loss because it is more likely than not that these attributes will not be realized. \n\nF-34 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nOn December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign tax credits as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Amount Expiration &#160; (In millions) &#160; Foreign tax credits $ 2,241 &#160; 2025-2026 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company has a $ 2.2 billion U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. foreign tax credits listed above because it is more likely than not that these attributes will expire unutilized. \n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, &#8220;Income Taxes,&#8221; which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions generally refer to a position taken in a previously filed income tax return or expected to be included in a tax return to be filed in the future that is reflected in the measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 116 &#160; $ 93 &#160; $ 82 &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to prior year &#8212; &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to the current year &#8212; &#160; 7 &#160; 11 &#160; Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 27 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of year $ 89 &#160; $ 116 &#160; $ 93 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Each quarter, the Company assesses the amounts provided for and, as a result, may increase or reduce the amount of interest and penalties. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recorded tax expense of $ 1 million for interest and penalties. At December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company had an accrued liability for interest and penalties of $ 5 million, $ 4 million, and $ 3 million, respectively. \n\nIn 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recorded a $ 27 million net decrease, a $ 23 million net increase, and an $ 11 million net increase, respectively, in its reserve for uncertain tax positions. \n\nOn September 26, 2022, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency from the IRS disallowing certain net operating loss carryback and research and development credit refund claims. As a result of the disallowance, on December 14, 2022, the Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court challenging the tax adjustments and requesting a redetermination of the deficiencies stated in the notice. \n\nApache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority. Apache&#8217;s earliest open tax years in its key jurisdictions are as follows: \n\nJurisdiction \n\n##TABLE_START U.S. 2014 Egypt 2005 U.K. 2021 ##TABLE_END\n\nF-35 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nLegal Matters \n\nThe Company is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls, which also may include controls related to the potential impacts of climate change. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $ 64 million for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. The Company&#8217;s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management&#8217;s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material matters that the Company believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management&#8217;s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. \n\nArgentine Environmental Claims \n\nOn March 12, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries&#8217; operations and properties in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF). As part of that sale, YPF assumed responsibility for all of the past, present, and future litigation in Argentina involving Company subsidiaries, except that Company subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify YPF for certain environmental, tax, and royalty obligations capped at an aggregate of $ 100 million. The indemnity is subject to specific agreed conditions precedent, thresholds, contingencies, limitations, claim deadlines, loss sharing, and other terms and conditions. On April 11, 2014, YPF provided its first notice of claims pursuant to the indemnity. Company subsidiaries have not paid any amounts under the indemnity but will continue to review and consider claims presented by YPF. Further, Company subsidiaries retain the right to enforce certain Argentina-related indemnification obligations against Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) in an amount up to $ 45 million pursuant to the terms and conditions of stock purchase agreements entered in 2006 between Company subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Pioneer. \n\nLouisiana Restoration &#160; \n\nLouisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including the Company, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to its original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time to time, restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While adverse judgments against the Company are possible, the Company intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims. \n\nStarting in November of 2013 and continuing into 2022, several parishes in Louisiana have pending lawsuits against many oil and gas producers, including the Company. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that defendants&#8217; oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. While adverse judgments against the Company might be possible, the Company intends to vigorously oppose these claims. \n\nF-36 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nApollo Exploration Lawsuit \n\nIn a case captioned Apollo Exploration, LLC, Cogent Exploration, Ltd. Co. &#38; SellmoCo, LLC v. Apache Corporation , Cause No. CV50538 in the 385 th Judicial District Court, Midland County, Texas, plaintiffs alleged damages in excess of $ 200 million (having previously claimed in excess of $ 1.1 billion) relating to purchase and sale agreements, mineral leases, and area of mutual interest agreements concerning properties located in Hartley, Moore, Potter, and Oldham Counties, Texas. The trial court entered final judgment in favor of the Company, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing by their claims and awarding the Company its attorneys&#8217; fees and costs incurred in defending the lawsuit. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court&#8217;s judgment thereby reinstating some of plaintiff&#8217;s claims. The Texas Supreme Court granted the Company&#8217;s petition for review and heard oral argument in October 2022. \n\nAustralian Operations Divestiture Dispute \n\nPursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (Quadrant SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. In April 2017, the Company filed suit against Quadrant for breach of the Quadrant SPA. In its suit, the Company seeks approximately AUD $ 80 million. In December 2017, Quadrant filed a defense of equitable set-off to the Company&#8217;s claim and a counterclaim seeking approximately AUD $ 200 million in the aggregate. The Company believes that Quadrant&#8217;s claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity. \n\nCanadian Operations Divestiture Dispute \n\nPursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 6, 2017 (Paramount SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Canadian operations to Paramount Resources LTD (Paramount). Closing occurred on August 16, 2017. On September 11, 2019, four ex-employees of Apache Canada LTD on behalf of themselves and individuals employed by Apache Canada LTD on July 6, 2017, filed an Amended Statement of Claim in a matter styled Stephen Flesch et. al. v Apache Corporation et. al ., No. 1901-09160 Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench of Alberta against the Company and others seeking class certification and a finding that the Paramount SPA amounted to a Change of Control of the Company, entitling them to accelerated vesting under the Company&#8217;s equity plans. In the suit, the class seeks approximately $ 60 million USD and punitive damages. The Company believes that plaintiffs&#8217; claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity. \n\nCalifornia and Delaware Litigation \n\nOn July 17, 2017, in three separate actions, San Mateo and Marin Counties and the City of Imperial Beach, California, all filed suit individually and on behalf of the people of the state of California against over 30 oil and gas companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. On December 20, 2017, in two separate actions, the City of Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County filed similar lawsuits against many of the same defendants. On January 22, 2018, the City of Richmond filed a similar lawsuit. On November 14, 2018, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen&#8217;s Associations, Inc. also filed a similar lawsuit against many of the same defendants. After removal of all such lawsuits to federal court, the district court remanded them back to state court. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals&#8217; affirmance of this remand decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. That appeal was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a similar case, BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore . As a result, the California cases were sent back to the 9th Circuit for further appellate review of the decision to remand the cases to state court. The 9 th Circuit has since, once again, affirmed the district court&#8217;s remand to state court. The defendants are appealing this latest remand decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nOn September 10, 2020, the State of Delaware filed suit, individually and on behalf of the people of the State of Delaware, against over 25 oil and gas companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. After removal of this lawsuit to federal court, the district court remanded it back to state court. The 3 rd Circuit has since, once again, affirmed the district court&#8217;s remand to state court. The defendants are appealing this latest remand decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nThe Company believes that it is not subject to jurisdiction of the California courts and that claims made against it in the California and Delaware litigation are baseless. The Company intends to challenge jurisdiction in California and to vigorously defend the Delaware lawsuit. \n\nF-37 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nCastex Lawsuit \n\nIn a case styled Apache Corporation v. Castex Offshore, Inc., et. al. , Cause No. 2015-48580, in the 113th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, Castex filed claims for alleged damages of approximately $ 200 million, relating to overspend on the Belle Isle Gas Facility upgrade, and the drilling of five sidetracks on the Potomac #3 well. After a jury trial, a verdict of approximately $ 60 million, plus fees, costs, and interest was entered against the Company. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals of Texas reversed the judgment, in part, reducing the judgment to approximately $ 13.5 million, plus fees, costs, and interest against the Company. Further appeal is pending. \n\nShareholder and Derivative Lawsuits \n\nOn February 23, 2021, a case captioned Plymouth County Retirement System v. Apache Corporation, et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) against the Company and certain current and former officers. The complaint, which is a shareholder lawsuit styled as a class action, alleges that (1) the Company intentionally used unrealistic assumptions regarding the amount and composition of available oil and gas in Alpine High; (2) the Company did not have the proper infrastructure in place to safely and/or economically drill and/or transport those resources even if they existed in the amounts purported; (3) certain statements and omissions artificially inflated the value of the Company&#8217;s operations in the Permian Basin; and (4) as a result, the Company&#8217;s public statements were materially false and misleading. The Company believes that plaintiffs&#8217; claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit. \n\nOn January 18, 2023, a case captioned Jerry Hight, Derivatively and on behalf of APA Corporation v. John J. Christmann IV et al. was filed in the 61st District Court of Harris County, Texas. The case purports to be a derivative action brought against senior management and Company directors over many of the same allegations included in the Plymouth County Retirement System matter and asserts claims of (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) waste of corporate assets; and (3) unjust enrichment. The defendants believe that plaintiff&#8217;s claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nThe Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. The Company maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental risks. \n\nThe Company manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to the Company&#8217;s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. The Company&#8217;s general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding $ 300,000 . Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In the Company&#8217;s estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $ 1 million. \n\nOn September 11, 2020, the Company received a Notice of Violation and Finding of Violation, and accompanying Clean Air Act Information Request, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) following site inspections in April 2019 at several of the Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas production facilities in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. The notice and information request involve alleged emissions control and reporting violations. The Company is cooperating with the EPA and has responded to the information request. The EPA has referred the notice for civil enforcement proceedings; however, at this time the Company is unable to reasonably estimate whether such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions and, if so, whether they would be more or less than $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs. \n\nF-38 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nOn December 29, 2020, the Company received a Notice of Violation and Opportunity to Confer, and accompanying Clean Air Act Information Request, from the EPA following helicopter flyovers in September 2019 of several of the Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas production facilities in Reeves County, Texas. The notice and information request involve alleged emissions control and reporting violations. The Company is cooperating with the EPA and has responded to the information request. The EPA has referred the notice for civil enforcement proceedings; however, at this time the Company is unable to reasonably estimate whether such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions and, if so, whether they would be more or less than $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs. \n\nThe Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 2022 that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company&#8217;s properties. \n\nPotential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties \n\nIn 2013, Apache sold its Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Shelf operations and properties and its GOM operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $ 3.75 billion and Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOM Assets). In respect of such abandonment obligations, Fieldwood posted letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit) and established trust accounts (Trust A and Trust B) of which Apache was a beneficiary and which were funded by two net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the 2018 bankruptcy, Fieldwood confirmed a plan under which Apache agreed, inter alia, to (i) accept bonds in exchange for certain of the Letters of Credit and (ii) amend the Trust A trust agreement and one of the NPIs to consolidate the trusts into a single Trust (Trust A) funded by both remaining NPIs. Currently, Apache holds two bonds (Bonds) and five Letters of Credit to secure Fieldwood&#8217;s asset retirement obligations on the Legacy GOM Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for decommissioning any Legacy GOM Asset over the remaining life of the Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nOn August 3, 2020, Fieldwood again filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On June 25, 2021, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) entered an order confirming Fieldwood&#8217;s bankruptcy plan. On August 27, 2021, Fieldwood&#8217;s bankruptcy plan became effective. Pursuant to the plan, the Legacy GOM Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf&#8217;s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOM Assets will be used to fund decommissioning of Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nBy letter dated April 5, 2022, replacing two prior letters dated September 8, 2021 and February 22, 2022, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it is currently obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOM Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE to decommission certain of the Legacy GOM Assets included in GOM Shelf&#8217;s notification to BSEE. Apache expects to receive such orders on the other Legacy GOM Assets included in GOM Shelf&#8217;s notification letter. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nIf Apache incurs costs to decommission any Legacy GOM Asset and GOM Shelf does not reimburse Apache for such costs, then Apache expects to obtain reimbursement from Trust A, the Bonds, and the Letters of Credit until such funds and securities are fully utilized. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache has agreed to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $ 400 million to perform decommissioning (Standby Loan Agreement), with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOM Assets. \n\nIf the combination of GOM Shelf&#8217;s net cash flow from its producing properties, the Trust A funds, the Bonds, and the remaining Letters of Credit are insufficient to fully fund decommissioning of any Legacy GOM Assets that Apache may be ordered by BSEE to perform, or if GOM Shelf&#8217;s net cash flow from its remaining producing properties after the Trust A funds, Bonds, and Letters of Credit are exhausted is insufficient to repay any loans made by Apache under the Standby Loan Agreement, then Apache may be forced to effectively use its available cash to fund the deficit. \n\nF-39 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund decommissioning of Legacy GOM Assets it may be ordered to perform ranges from $ 1.2 billion to $ 1.4 billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a contingent liability of $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022, representing the estimated costs of decommissioning it may be required to perform on Legacy GOM Assets. Of the total liability recorded, $ 738 million is reflected under the caption &#8220;Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of Mexico properties,&#8221; and $ 450 million is reflected under &#8220;Other current liabilities&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache&#8217;s estimated liability, including expected decommissioning rig spread rates, lift boat rates, and planned abandonment logistics could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has also recorded a $ 667 million asset, which represents the amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from the Trust A funds, the Bonds, and the Letters of Credit for decommissioning it may be required to perform on Legacy GOM Assets. Of the total asset recorded, $ 217 million is reflected under the caption &#8220;Decommissioning security for sold Gulf of Mexico properties,&#8221; and $ 450 million is reflected under &#8220;Other current assets.&#8221; The Company recognized $ 157 million and $ 446 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, of &#8220;Losses on previously sold Gulf of Mexico properties&#8221; to reflect the net impact of changes to the estimated decommissioning liability and decommissioning asset to the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations. \n\nLeases and Contractual Obligations \n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is an operating or finance lease at the inception of each contract. If the contract is classified as an operating lease, Apache records an ROU asset and corresponding liability reflecting the total remaining present value of fixed lease payments over the expected term of the lease agreement. The expected term of the lease may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. If the Company&#8217;s lease does not provide an implicit rate in the contract, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate when calculating the present value. In the normal course of business, Apache enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of the standard. ROU assets are reflected within &#8220;Deferred charges and other assets&#8221; on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet, and the associated operating lease liabilities are reflected within &#8220;Other current liabilities&#8221; and &#8220;Other&#8221; within &#8220;Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities,&#8221; as applicable. As allowed under ASU 2016-02, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842),&#8221; the Company applied practical expedients permitting an entity the option to not evaluate under such standard those existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases as well as permitting an entity the option to carry forward its historical assessments of whether existing agreements contain a lease, classification of existing lease agreements, and treatment of initial direct lease costs. \n\nOperating lease expense associated with ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense is reflected on the statement of consolidated operations commensurate with the leased activities and nature of the services performed. Gross fixed operating lease expense, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners, was $ 144 million, $ 127 million, and $ 149 million for the years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As allowed under the standard, Apache elected to exclude short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation. \n\nIn addition, the Company periodically enters into finance leases that are similar to those leases classified as capital leases under previous GAAP. Finance lease assets are included in &#8220;Property, Plant, and Equipment&#8221; on the consolidated balance sheet, and the associated finance lease liabilities are reflected within &#8220; Current debt &#8221; and &#8220; Long-term debt ,&#8221; as applicable. Depreciation on the Company&#8217;s finance lease asset was $ 2 million in each of the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. Interest on the Company&#8217;s finance lease liability was $ 2 million in each of the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. \n\nThe following table represents the Company&#8217;s weighted average lease term and discount rate as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating Leases Finance Lease Weighted average remaining lease term 2.5 years 10.7 years Weighted average discount rate 3.7 &#160; % 4.4 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nF-40 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nAt December 31, 2022, contractual obligations for long-term operating leases, finance leases, and purchase obligations are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Net Minimum Commitments (1) \n\nOperating Leases (2) \n\nFinance Lease (3) \n\nPurchase Obligations (4)(5) \n\n(In millions) 2023 $ 174 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ 222 &#160; 2024 102 &#160; 3 &#160; 183 &#160; 2025 14 &#160; 4 &#160; 163 &#160; 2026 6 &#160; 4 &#160; 1,951 &#160; 2027 6 &#160; 4 &#160; 133 &#160; Thereafter 11 &#160; 27 &#160; 333 &#160; Total future minimum payments 313 &#160; 45 &#160; $ 2,985 &#160; Less: imputed interest ( 14 ) ( 11 ) N/A Total lease liabilities 299 &#160; 34 &#160; N/A Current portion 167 &#160; 2 &#160; N/A Non-current portion $ 132 &#160; $ 32 &#160; N/A ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities for which the Company is not the operator. \n\n(2) Amounts represent future payments associated with oil and gas operations inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners. Such payments may be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties and subsequently depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense. \n\n(3) Amounts represent the Company&#8217;s finance lease obligation related to the Company&#8217;s Midland, Texas regional office building. \n\n(4) Amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. Total costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were $ 183 million, $ 194 million, and $ 120 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n(5) Under terms agreed to in the new Egypt merged concession agreement, the Company committed to spend a minimum of $ 3.5 billion on exploration, development, and operating activities by March 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has spent $ 1.7 billion and believes it will be able to satisfy the remaining obligation within its current exploration and development program. \n\nThe lease liability reflected in the table above represents the Company&#8217;s fixed minimum payments that are settled in accordance with the lease terms. Actual lease payments during the period may also include variable lease components such as common area maintenance, usage-based sales taxes and rate differentials, or other similar costs that are not determinable at the inception of the lease. Gross variable lease payments, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners were $ 89 million, $ 63 million, and $ 41 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nIn addition to the lease liabilities in the table above, at December 31, 2022, undiscounted fixed minimum payments for operating leases not yet commenced totaled $ 207 million. The leases primarily relate to office leases in Houston and Egypt, and estimated cash payments for 2023 are not expected to be material. The underlying assets for these leases were primarily designed by the lessors, and the Company is in the process of designing leasehold improvements for both leases. \n\n13. RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS \n\nThe Company provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute to the plan up to 50 percent of eligible compensation as defined in the plan, with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of 8 percent of each employee&#8217;s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes 6 percent of each participating employee&#8217;s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to 50 percent of each employee&#8217;s base salary, up to 75 percent of each employee&#8217;s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company&#8217;s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan. \n\nF-41 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nVesting in the Company&#8217;s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of 20 percent for every completed year of employment. Upon a qualifying change in control of ownership of APA Corporation, as defined in the applicable plan, immediate and full vesting occurs. \n\nThe aggregate annual cost to the Company of all U.S. and international savings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was $ 40 million, $ 31 million, and $ 43 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Company also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company&#8217;s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea&#8217;s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003. \n\nAdditionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of 65 or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage.

The Company intends that this blend of investments will provide a reasonable rate of return such that the benefits promised to members are provided. The U.K. Pension Plan policy is to target an ongoing funding level of 100 percent through prudent investments and includes policies and strategies such as investment goals, risk management practices, and permitted and prohibited investments.

REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST &#8212; ALTUS \n\nPreferred Units Issuance \n\nOn June 12, 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Preferred Units for an aggregate issue price of $ 625 million in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (the Closing). Altus Midstream LP received approximately $ 611 million in cash proceeds from the sale after deducting transaction costs and discounts to certain purchasers. \n\nClassification \n\nPrior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, at December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of the Preferred Units was recorded as &#8220;Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest &#8212; Altus Preferred Unit Limited Partners&#8221; and classified as temporary equity on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet based on the terms of the Preferred Units, including the redemption rights with respect thereto. \n\nMeasurement \n\nAltus applied a two-step approach to subsequent measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest related to the Preferred Units by first allocating a portion of the net income of Altus Midstream LP in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. An additional adjustment to the carrying value of the Preferred Unit redeemable noncontrolling interest at each period end was recorded, if applicable. The amount of such adjustment was determined based upon the accreted value method to reflect the passage of time until the Preferred Units were exchangeable at the option of the holder. Pursuant to this method, the net transaction price was accreted using the effective interest method to the Redemption Price calculated at the seventh anniversary of the Closing. The total adjustment was limited to an amount such that the carrying amount of the Preferred Unit redeemable noncontrolling interest at each period end was equal to the greater of (a) the sum of (i) the carrying amount of the Preferred Units, plus (ii) the fair value of the embedded derivative liability and (b) the accreted value of the net transaction price. \n\nActivity related to the Preferred Units for the 2022 and 2021 periods is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Units Outstanding Financial Position (1) \n\n(In millions, except unit data) Redeemable noncontrolling interest &#8212; Altus Preferred Unit limited partners: at December 31, 2020 660,694 &#160; $ 608 &#160; Cash distributions to Altus Preferred Unit limited partners &#8212; ( 46 ) Distributions payable to Altus Preferred Unit limited partners &#8212; ( 12 ) Allocation of Altus Midstream net income N/A 80 &#160; Accreted value adjustment N/A 82 &#160; Redeemable noncontrolling interest &#8212; Altus Preferred Unit limited partners: at December 31, 2021 660,694 &#160; 712 &#160; Allocation of Altus Midstream LP net income N/A 12 &#160; Accreted value adjustment (1) \n\nN/A ( 82 ) Redeemable noncontrolling interest &#8212; Altus Preferred Unit limited partners: at February 22, 2022 660,694 &#160; 642 &#160; Preferred Units embedded derivative 89 &#160; Deconsolidation of Altus ( 731 ) $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes the reversal of previously recorded accreted value adjustments due to the deconsolidation of Altus. \n\nN/A - not applicable. \n\nF-46 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n15. CAPITAL STOCK AND EQUITY \n\nUpon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, each outstanding share of Apache common stock automatically converted into a share of APA common stock on a one -for-one basis. As a result, each stockholder of Apache now owns the same number of shares of APA common stock that such stockholder owned of Apache common stock immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization. As a result of the Holding Company Reorganization and subsequent activity, Apache recorded various intercompany activities during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 as capital transactions, which are reflected in Apache&#8217;s Statement of Consolidated Changes in Equity (Deficit) and Noncontrolling Interest. Refer to Note 2&#8212;Transactions with Parent Affiliate for more detail. \n\nAdditionally, in connection with the Holding Company Reorganization, Apache transferred to APA, and APA assumed, sponsorship of all of Apache&#8217;s stock plans along with all of Apache&#8217;s rights and obligations under each plan. Subsequent to the Holding Company Reorganization, stock-based compensation associated with APA equity awards granted and outstanding to Apache employees are reflected as capital contributions from APA to Apache. \n\nNet Income (Loss) per Common Share \n\nNet income (loss) per share for Apache is no longer required, as its shares are not publicly traded, and Apache is now a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of APA. \n\nStock Compensation Plans \n\nPrior to consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company maintained several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. In 2021, pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, Apache&#8217;s outstanding common shares were converted into equivalent corresponding shares of APA. APA assumed sponsorship of all stock compensation plans. All cash-settled awards previously indexed to Apache&#8217;s stock price were subsequently indexed to APA&#8217;s stock price, and all unvested stock-settled awards will be settled in APA stock upon vesting. \n\nOn May 12, 2016, the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved the 2016 Omnibus Compensation Plan (the 2016 Plan), which is used to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives by granting incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, performance awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, cash awards, or any combination of the foregoing. As of December 31, 2022, 10.1 million shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2016 Plan. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2016 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2016 Plan. In 2018, the Company began issuing cash-settled awards (phantom units) under the restricted stock and conditional restricted stock unit plans. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company&#8217;s stock and, once vested, are settled in cash. \n\nCosts related to the plans are capitalized or expensed to &#8220;Lease operating expenses,&#8221; &#8220;Exploration,&#8221; or &#8220;General and administrative&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s statement of consolidated operations based on the nature of each employee&#8217;s activities.

The Omnibus Plans were submitted to and approved by the Company&#8217;s shareholders. New shares of common stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises. Under the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of APA&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant. Options granted become exercisable ratably over a three-year period and expire 10 years after granted. \n\nF-47 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; Shares Under Option Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Under Option Weighted Average Exercise Price Shares Under Option Weighted Average Exercise Price (In thousands, except exercise price amounts) Outstanding, beginning of year 3,012 &#160; $ 63.79 &#160; 3,537 &#160; $ 72.10 &#160; 4,298 &#160; $ 75.24 &#160; Exercised ( 99 ) 42.09 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Forfeited ( 2 ) 49.10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 37 ) 44.98 &#160; Expired ( 833 ) 81.56 &#160; ( 525 ) 119.83 &#160; ( 724 ) 92.14 &#160; \n\nOutstanding, end of year (1) \n\n2,078 &#160; 57.71 &#160; 3,012 &#160; 63.79 &#160; 3,537 &#160; 72.10 &#160; Expected to vest &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 150 &#160; 45.77 &#160; \n\nExercisable, end of year (1) \n\n2,078 &#160; 57.71 &#160; 3,012 &#160; 63.79 &#160; 3,387 &#160; 73.26 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) As of December 31, 2022, options exercisable and outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.1 years and aggregate intrinsic value of $ 3.5 million. \n\nThere were no options issued and 98,646 options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2022.

The value of the stock-settled restricted stock unit awards is established by the market price on the date of grant and is recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. The restricted stock phantom unit awards represent a hypothetical interest in either APA&#8217;s common stock or, prior to the BCP Business Combination, in ALTM&#8217;s common stock, as applicable, and, once vested, are settled in cash. Compensation expense related to the cash-settled awards is recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the applicable vesting term. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, compensation costs charged to expense for the restricted stock units and restricted stock phantom units was $ 145 million, $ 91 million, and $ 39 million, respectively.

Total compensation cost for the restricted stock units and the restricted stock phantom units, absent any forfeitures, is estimated to be $ 24 million and $ 85 million, respectively, and was calculated based on the per-share fair market value of a share of APA&#8217;s common stock as of the grant date. Compensation cost will be recognized over a three-year vesting period for both plans. The restricted stock phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock, a Level 1 fair value measurement. \n\nPerformance Program \n\nTo provide long-term incentives for the Company&#8217;s employees to deliver competitive shareholder returns, the Company makes annual grants of conditional restricted stock units to eligible employees. Apache has a performance program for certain eligible employees with payout for a portion of the shares based upon measurement of total shareholder return (TSR) of APA common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Payout for the remaining portion of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives are calculated at the end of the award&#8217;s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted stock units awarded. The performance shares will immediately vest 50 percent at the end of the three-year performance period, with the remaining 50 percent vesting at the end of the following year. Grants from the performance programs outstanding at December 31, 2022, are as described below: \n\n&#8226; In January 2018, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2018 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 931,049 units. A total of 23,633 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 23 percent of target. \n\n&#8226; In January 2019, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2019 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,679,832 units. A total of 604,417 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 100 percent of target. \n\n&#8226; In January 2020, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2020 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,687,307 units. A total of 1,311,715 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 155 percent of target. \n\nF-49 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\n&#8226; In January 2021, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2021 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,959,856 units. The actual amount of phantom units awarded will be between zero and 200 percent of target. A total of 1,826,890 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2022, from which a minimum of zero to a maximum of 3,653,780 units could be awarded. \n\n&#8226; In January 2022, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the 2022 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,093,034 units. The actual amount of phantom units awarded will be between zero and 200 percent of target. A total of 1,068,530 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2022, from which a minimum of zero to a maximum of 2,137,060 units could be awarded. \n\nCompensation costs charged to expense under the performance programs were an expense of $ 136 million, an expense of $ 56 million, and a credit of $ 8 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Capitalized compensation costs under the performance programs were an expense of $ 21 million, an expense of $ 3 million, and a credit of $ 1 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe following table summarizes cash-settled conditional restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Units &#160; (In thousands) Non-vested, beginning of year 4,531 &#160; Granted 1,676 &#160; Vested ( 656 ) Forfeited ( 106 ) Expired ( 610 ) \n\nNon-vested, end of year (1) \n\n4,835 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding liability for the unvested cash-settled conditional restricted stock units that had not been recognized was approximately $ 53 million. \n\nIn January 2023, APA&#8217;s board of directors approved the 2023 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Payout for 40 percent of the shares is based upon measurement of TSR of APA common stock as compared to a designated peer group and the S&#38;P 500 Index during a three-year performance period. Payout for the remaining 60 percent of the shares is based on the performance and financial objectives defined in the 2023 Performance Program. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 797,429 units, with the ultimate number of phantom units to be awarded ranging from zero to a maximum of 1,594,858 units. These phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company&#8217;s common stock, and, once vested, are settled in cash. The TSR component of the award had a grant date fair value per award of $ 62.15 based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The grant date fair value per award for the remaining 60 percent was $ 44.06 based on the weighted-average fair market value of a share of common stock of APA as of the grant date. These 2023 Performance Program phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock, a Level 1 fair value measurement. \n\n16.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. During 2022, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately 15 percent of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During 2021, sales to EGPC and CFE International accounted for approximately 14 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During 2020, sales to EGPC and Vitol accounted for approximately 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. \n\nManagement does not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. \n\n18. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is engaged in exploration and production (Upstream) activities across three operating segments: Egypt, North Sea, and the U.S. The Company&#8217;s Upstream business explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil and NGLs.

Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the &#8220;economic interest&#8221; method, which excludes the host country&#8217;s share of reserves. \n\nEstimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the &#8220;proved&#8221; classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company&#8217;s reserve estimates. \n\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The reserve data in the following tables only represent estimates and should not be construed as being exact. \n\nF-56 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211;

The Company recorded 22 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., comprising 9 MMboe in the Permian Basin, 8 MMboe in the Texas Gulf Coast, and 5 MMboe in the Delaware Basin. Drilling programs for the Permian and Delaware Basins include the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Spraberry with the Austin Chalk as the primary focus for the Texas Gulf Coast. International operations contributed 12 MMboe of exploration and development adds, with Egypt contributing 9 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity primarily in the Khalda Area and 3 MMboe from the North Sea. The Company had combined upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 75 MMboe. Upward revisions related to miscellaneous changes accounted for 5 MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 70 MMboe, with Egypt accounting for an increase of 43 MMboe, primarily the result of PSC modernization in Egypt. The North Sea contributed 9 MMboe of upward revisions from well performance and reactivations in both the Beryl and Forties programs. In the United States, the Company experienced positive revisions of 18 MMboe. The Company acquired 1 MMboe of proved reserves and sold 26 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to Permian Basin assets. \n\nF-60 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nDuring 2021, the Company added approximately 102 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 77 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., comprising 59 MMboe in the Permian Basin with the remaining 18 MMboe in the Texas Gulf Coast. The Permian Basin drilling programs targeted the Woodford, Barnett, Bone Springs, and Spraberry, while the Texas Gulf Coast focused on the Austin Chalk. International operations contributed 25 MMboe of exploration and development adds, with Egypt contributing 22 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity primarily in the Khalda Area concession post-PSC modernization. The North Sea contributed 3 MMboe. The Company had combined upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 107 MMboe. Upward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for 85 MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 22 MMboe, with the new merged concession agreement in Egypt resulting in an increase of 57 MMboe, partially offset by other downward revisions of 35 MMboe across all of the Company&#8217;s geographic areas of operation. The Company also sold 28 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to Permian Basin assets. \n\nAs previously discussed, in December 2021, the Egyptian government signed into law an agreement to modernize and consolidate a majority of the Company&#8217;s Egypt PSCs. The impact of the consolidated PSC to proved reserves based on the modernized terms is an estimated increase of 53 MMboe and 4 MMboe in developed and undeveloped reserves, respectively, and approximately $ 750 million in discounted future net cash flows. Approximately 96 percent of the Company&#8217;s Egypt reserves are now consolidated within the modernized PSC. These estimates include Sinopec&#8217;s noncontrolling interest in Egypt. \n\nDuring 2020, the Company added approximately 78 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 39 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., primarily in the Southern Midland Basin ( 26 MMboe) associated with the Wolfcamp and Spraberry drilling programs and the remainder in the Delaware Basin and Austin Chalk. The international operations contributed 39 MMboe of exploration and development adds during 2020, with Egypt contributing 32 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity primarily in the Khalda Area and Umbarka Area concessions. The North Sea contributed 7 MMboe from drilling success, primarily in the Beryl Field. The Company had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 45 MMboe. Downward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for 70 MMboe, engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 27 MMboe, and downward interest revisions accounted for 2 MMboe. The Company also sold 10 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to Eastern Shelf and Magnet Withers/Pickett Ridge. \n\nApproximately 11 percent of the Company&#8217;s year-end 2022 estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 18, under &#8220;Future Net Cash Flows.&#8221; \n\nFuture Net Cash Flows \n\nFuture cash inflows as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Future development costs include abandonment and dismantlement costs. \n\nF-61 \n\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8211; (Continued) \n\nThe following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under laws in effect as of December 31, 2022, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used. \n\n##TABLE_START United States Egypt (1) \n\nNorth Sea Total (1) \n\n&#160; (In millions) 2022 Cash inflows $ 29,490 &#160; $ 12,819 &#160; $ 10,147 &#160; $ 52,456 &#160; Production costs ( 10,221 ) ( 2,086 ) ( 3,241 ) ( 15,548 ) Development costs ( 1,598 ) ( 1,471 ) ( 2,297 ) ( 5,366 ) Income tax expense ( 1,389 ) ( 2,729 ) ( 2,631 ) ( 6,749 ) Net cash flows 16,282 &#160; 6,533 &#160; 1,978 &#160; 24,793 &#160; 10 percent discount rate ( 6,422 ) ( 1,400 ) ( 204 ) ( 8,026 ) Discounted future net cash flows (2) \n\n$ 9,860 &#160; $ 5,133 &#160; $ 1,774 &#160; $ 16,767 &#160; 2021 Cash inflows $ 22,852 &#160; $ 9,337 &#160; $ 6,832 &#160; $ 39,021 &#160; Production costs ( 8,323 ) ( 1,712 ) ( 2,343 ) ( 12,378 ) Development costs ( 1,632 ) ( 1,402 ) ( 2,533 ) ( 5,567 ) Income tax expense ( 134 ) ( 1,887 ) ( 768 ) ( 2,789 ) Net cash flows 12,763 &#160; 4,336 &#160; 1,188 &#160; 18,287 &#160; 10 percent discount rate ( 5,294 ) ( 983 ) 350 &#160; ( 5,927 ) Discounted future net cash flows (2) \n\n$ 7,469 &#160; $ 3,353 &#160; $ 1,538 &#160; $ 12,360 &#160; 2020 Cash inflows $ 12,537 &#160; $ 5,560 &#160; $ 4,122 &#160; $ 22,219 &#160; Production costs ( 6,244 ) ( 1,704 ) ( 2,388 ) ( 10,336 ) Development costs ( 1,555 ) ( 633 ) ( 2,448 ) ( 4,636 ) Income tax expense &#8212; &#160; ( 1,096 ) 316 &#160; ( 780 ) Net cash flows 4,738 &#160; 2,127 &#160; ( 398 ) 6,467 &#160; 10 percent discount rate ( 1,829 ) ( 437 ) 1,111 &#160; ( 1,155 ) Discounted future net cash flows (2) \n\n$ 2,909 &#160; $ 1,690 &#160; $ 713 &#160; $ 5,312 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes discounted future net cash flows of approximately $ 2.5 billion , $ 1.6 billion, and $ 563 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, attributable to noncontrolling interests in Egypt. \n\n(2) Estimated future net cash flows before income tax expense, discounted at 10 percent per annum, totaled approximately $ 16.1 billion , $ 14.9 billion, and $ 7.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe following table sets forth the principal sources of change in the discounted future net cash flows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; For the Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (In millions) Sales, net of production costs $ ( 6,970 ) $ ( 4,707 ) $ ( 2,422 ) Net change in prices and production costs 8,627 &#160; 9,376 &#160; ( 5,753 ) Discoveries and improved recovery, net of related costs 1,132 &#160; 1,749 &#160; 751 &#160; Change in future development costs ( 347 ) ( 839 ) 20 &#160; Previously estimated development costs incurred during the period 669 &#160; 545 &#160; 576 &#160; Revision of quantities 2,621 &#160; 1,983 &#160; ( 418 ) Purchases of minerals in-place 17 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Accretion of discount 1,489 &#160; 626 &#160; 1,236 &#160; Change in income taxes ( 2,371 ) ( 1,583 ) 1,533 &#160; Sales of minerals in-place ( 363 ) ( 116 ) ( 104 ) Change in production rates and other ( 97 ) 13 &#160; 11 &#160; $ 4,407 &#160; $ 7,048 &#160; $ ( 4,570 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nF-62 \n\n"
