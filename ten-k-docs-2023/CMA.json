      "text": " Item 1. Business. \n\nGENERAL \n\nComerica Incorporated (&#8220;Comerica&#8221;) is a financial services company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1973, and headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y-9C), it was among the 25 largest commercial United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) financial holding companies. As of December 31, 2022, Comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2 active banking subsidiaries (Comerica Bank, a Texas banking association, and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association) and 28 non-banking subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, Comerica had total assets of approximately $85.4 billion, total deposits of approximately $71.4 billion, total loans of approximately $53.4 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of approximately $5.2 billion. \n\nComerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank, and Wealth Management. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. \n\nComerica operates in three primary geographic markets - Texas, California, and Michigan, as well as in Arizona and Florida, with select businesses operating in several other states, and in Canada and Mexico. \n\nWe provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services: (1) under the caption, &#8220;Analysis of Net Interest Income&#8221; starting on page F- 4 of the Financial Section of this report; (2) under the caption &#8220;Rate/Volume Analysis&#8221; starting on page F- 5 of the Financial Section of this report; and (3) under the caption &#8220;Noninterest Income&#8221; starting on page F- 6 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nCOMPETITION \n\nThe financial services business is highly competitive. Comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their primary geographic markets covering the major metropolitan areas in Texas, California, and Michigan, as well as in Arizona and Florida. In addition, they compete throughout the continental U.S., Mexico and Canada as they pursue certain businesses on a national scale that fall outside of the primary markets, such as U.S. Banking, Mortgage Banker, Environmental Services and National Dealer Services. They have strategically placed offices in faster growing markets where there is a concentration of customers and industries they serve. Comerica has recently expanded its presence in the Southeastern U.S. by establishing commercial offices in North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as a private banking office in Georgia. Additionally, Comerica is making investments in the Mountain West region of the United States. \n\nComerica is subject to competition with respect to various products and services, including, without limitation, commercial products such as loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management (including payments solutions and card services), capital markets, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management and loan syndications; consumer products such as loans, deposits and origination of mortgage loans and credit cards; and wealth management services such as fiduciary, private banking, retirement, securities-based lending, investment management and advisory, investment banking, brokerage and the sale of annuities and life, disability and long-term care insurance products. \n\nComerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise, the range of products and services offered, pricing and reputation, convenience, quality of service, responsiveness to customer needs and the overall customer relationship. Comerica's competitors include financial institutions of all sizes. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in Comerica's markets, may have a broader array of products and structure alternatives and, due to their size, may more easily absorb credit losses. Some of Comerica's competitors (larger or smaller) may have more liberal lending policies and aggressive pricing standards for loans, deposits and services. \n\nIncreasingly, Comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities, such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer. Further, Comerica's competitors may be subject to significantly different or lesser regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered. Some competitors may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the cost of regulations. \n\nIn addition to banks, Comerica and its banking subsidiaries also face competition from financial intermediaries, including savings and loan associations, consumer and commercial finance companies, leasing companies, venture capital funds, credit unions, investment banks, insurance companies and securities firms. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies, with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including crowdfunding, digital wallets and money transfer services. The ability of non-banks to provide services previously limited to traditional banks has intensified competition. Because non-banks are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. \n\nFinally, the industry continues to consolidate, which eliminates some regional and local institutions, while potentially strengthening acquirers. Comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future. \n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION \n\nBanks, bank holding companies, and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level. Comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System through the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Comerica Bank is chartered by the State of Texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking under the Texas Finance Code and the Texas Administrative Code. Comerica Bank has elected to be a member of the Federal Reserve System under the Federal Reserve Act and, consequently, is supervised and regulated by the FRB. Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) under the National Bank Act. Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association, by virtue of being a national bank, is also a member of the Federal Reserve System. Furthermore, given that Comerica Bank is a bank with assets in excess of $10 billion dollars, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The deposits of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) to the extent provided by law, and therefore Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association are each also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC. Certain transactions executed by Comerica Bank are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;). The Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) regulates financial institutions providing services to plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Comerica Bank&#8217;s Canada branch is supervised by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and its Mexico representative office is supervised by the Banco de M&#233;xico. Comerica Bank is also registered in the Cayman Islands and subject to supervision by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. \n\nThe FRB supervises non-banking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by Comerica. In addition, Comerica&#8217;s non-banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state, federal and self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs of the State of Michigan, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) (in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc.); the Department of Insurance and Financial Services of the State of Michigan (in the case of Comerica Insurance Services, Inc.); and the DOL (in the case of Comerica Securities, Inc. and Comerica Insurance Services, Inc.). \n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and intensity of supervision to which Comerica&#8217;s business is subject continue to increase in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological, economic and market changes. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. In 2018, with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;EGRRCPA&#8221;), as described below, there was some recalibration of the post-financial crisis framework; however, Comerica&#8217;s business remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision. \n\nComerica is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC, as well as the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. \n\nDescribed below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Comerica and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business of Comerica and its subsidiaries. \n\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act \n\nOn May 24, 2018, EGRRCPA was signed into law. Among other regulatory changes, EGRRCPA amended various sections of the Dodd-Frank Act, including section 165 of Dodd-Frank Act, which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies. Under EGRRCPA bank holding companies with less than $100 billion of consolidated assets, including Comerica, are exempt from all of the Dodd-Frank enhanced prudential standards, except risk committee requirements. As a result, Comerica currently is not subject to the remaining Dodd-Frank Act enhanced prudential standards or certain capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions (the &#8220;Tailoring Rules&#8221;). Should Comerica cross the $100 billion asset threshold and thus become a Category IV firm, it will be subject to additional and more stringent regulation, which includes, but is not limited to, enhanced prudential standards for U.S. banking organizations with $100 to $250 billion of consolidated assets such as supervisory-run \n\nstress testing; internal liquidity stress testing; and liquidity buffer requirements. In addition, Comerica would be required to pay the supervision and regulation fee assessment under the Dodd-Frank Act. \n\nRequirements for Approval of Activities and Acquisitions \n\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage. Comerica became a financial holding company in 2000. As a financial holding company, Comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies, and engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. Activities that are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; include, but are not limited to: securities underwriting; securities dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies (subject to regulatory requirements described below); insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB determines, in consultation with the Secretary of the United States Treasury, to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. &#8220;Complementary activities&#8221; are activities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. \n\nIn order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, Comerica and each of its depository institution subsidiaries must each remain &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; and Comerica, Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association are each &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under FRB standards. If Comerica or any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to cease being &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on Comerica&#8217;s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of Comerica or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order Comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies, or Comerica could elect to conform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company. \n\nIn addition, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires U.S. banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities. Comerica Bank&#8217;s current rating under the CRA is &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; If any subsidiary bank of Comerica were to receive a rating under the CRA of less than &#8220;Satisfactory,&#8221; Comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities. \n\nFederal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies. In many cases, no FRB approval is required for Comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior approval is required before Comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) or a bank. In considering applications for approval of acquisitions, the banking regulators may take several factors into account, including whether Comerica and its subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed, are in compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, or have CRA ratings of less than &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; \n\nAcquisitions of Ownership of Comerica \n\nAcquisitions of Comerica&#8217;s voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws, including the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the FRB before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of Comerica&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of Comerica&#8217;s stock. \n\nCapital and Liquidity \n\nComerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, FDIC and/or the OCC. In calculating risk-based capital requirements, a depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s assets and certain specified off-balance sheet items (such as unused commitments and standby letters of credit) are assigned to various risk categories defined by the FRB, each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments, based on counterparty type, asset class and maturity. A depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s capital is divided into three tiers: Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), additional Tier 1, and Tier 2. CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders&#8217; equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards, if any. Additional Tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. Comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale, cash flow hedges, and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1 capital. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses. More information is set forth in the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section starting on page F- 14 . \n\nEntities that engage in trading activities that exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital to account for market risk. Market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad market movements (such as changes in the general level of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or commodity prices) or from position specific factors. From time to time, Comerica&#8217;s trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels, in which case Comerica adjusts its risk-weighted assets to account for market risk as required. \n\nComerica and its bank subsidiaries, like other bank holding companies and banks, currently are required to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio, minimum Tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 4.5 percent, 6 percent and 8 percent of their total risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as unused commitments and standby letters of credit), respectively. Comerica and its bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Comerica and its bank subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221; (Tier 1 capital to non-risk-adjusted average total assets) of 4 percent. \n\nTo be well capitalized, Comerica&#8217;s bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio, minimum CET1 capital ratio, minimum Tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 5.0 percent, 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively. For purposes of the FRB&#8217;s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as Comerica, must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent and a total capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent to be well capitalized. The FRB may require bank holding companies, including Comerica, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company&#8217;s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. \n\nFailure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators, including restrictions on Comerica&#8217;s or its bank subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications, or other restrictions on growth. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Comerica met all of its minimum risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable well capitalized requirements, as shown in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) Comerica Incorporated (Consolidated) Comerica Bank December 31, 2022 CET1 capital (minimum $3.5 billion (Consolidated)) $ 7,884 &#160; $ 7,801 &#160; Tier 1 capital (minimum $4.7 billion (Consolidated)) 8,278 &#160; 7,801 &#160; Total capital (minimum $6.3 billion (Consolidated)) 9,817 &#160; 9,190 &#160; Risk-weighted assets 78,871 &#160; 78,781 &#160; Average assets (fourth quarter) 86,726 &#160; 86,608 &#160; CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum-4.5%) 10.00 &#160; % 9.90 &#160; % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum-6.0%) 10.50 &#160; 9.90 &#160; Total capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum-8.0%) 12.45 &#160; 11.67 &#160; Tier 1 capital to average assets (minimum-4.0%) 9.55 &#160; 9.01 &#160; Capital conservation buffer (minimum-2.5%) 4.45 &#160; 3.67 &#160; December 31, 2021 CET1 capital (minimum $3.1 billion (Consolidated)) $ 7,064 $ 7,634 Tier 1 capital (minimum $4.2 billion (Consolidated)) 7,458 7,634 Total capital (minimum $5.6 billion (Consolidated)) 8,608 8,584 Risk-weighted assets 69,708 69,542 Average assets (fourth quarter) 96,417 96,216 CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum-4.5%) 10.13 % 10.98 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum-6.0%) 10.70 10.98 Total capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum-8.0%) 12.35 12.34 Tier 1 capital to average assets (minimum-4.0%) 7.74 7.93 Capital conservation buffer (minimum-2.5%) 4.35 4.34 ##TABLE_END\n\nAdditional information on the calculation of Comerica&#8217;s and its bank subsidiaries&#8217; CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, total capital and risk-weighted assets is set forth in the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section starting on page F- 14 of the Financial Section of this report and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements starting on page F- 88 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act \n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; An institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, each of Comerica&#8217;s bank subsidiaries&#8217; capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under these regulations. \n\nAs an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, FDICIA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital-based safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises. The standards relate generally to, among others, earnings, liquidity, operations and management, asset quality, various risk and management exposures (e.g., credit, operational, market, interest rate, etc.) and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards. \n\nFDICIA also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements, regulatory standards for real estate lending, &#8220;truth in savings&#8221; provisions, the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch, and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the FDIC. \n\nDividends \n\nComerica Incorporated is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. Since Comerica&#8217;s consolidated net income and liquidity consists largely of net income of and dividends received from Comerica&#8217;s bank subsidiaries, Comerica&#8217;s ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon its receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to Comerica, as well as by Comerica to its shareholders. Certain, but not all, of these requirements are discussed below. No assurances can be given that Comerica&#8217;s bank subsidiaries will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to Comerica. \n\nComerica Bank and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the FRB and/or the OCC, as the case may be, for the declaration and payment of dividends, if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of (i) such bank's net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. At January 1, 2023, Comerica's subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately $506 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years. Comerica's subsidiary banks declared dividends of $1.0 billion in 2022, $852 million in 2021 and $498 million in 2020. \n\nComerica and its bank subsidiaries must maintain a CET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends. \n\nFurthermore, federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDICIA &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regime discussed above, which applies to each of Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association, a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; In addition, Comerica Bank is also subject to limitations under Texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to Comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels. \n\nFRB supervisory guidance generally provides that a bank holding company should not maintain its existing rate of dividends on common stock unless (1) the organization&#8217;s net income over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition and (3) the organization will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. The supervisory guidance also provides that a bank holding company should inform the FRB reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company&#8217;s capital structure. Bank holding companies also are required to consult with the FRB before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments, or materially increasing dividends. \n\nTransactions with Affiliates \n\nFederal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including between Comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Comerica&#8217;s affiliate insured depository institutions, on the other. For example, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution&#8217;s loans and other &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any particular nonbank affiliate (including financial subsidiaries) to no more than 10% of the institution&#8217;s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution&#8217;s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20% of its total capital. &#8220;Covered transactions&#8221; are defined by statute to include (i) a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, (ii) a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, (iii) a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, (iv) the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, (v) the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and (vi) securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate, to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowing/lending or derivative counterparty. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution&#8217;s loans to its nonbank affiliates be, at a minimum, 100% secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution&#8217;s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as Comerica Bank and Comerica Bank &#38; Trust, National Association, and their subsidiaries to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders. \n\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity Regulation \n\nComerica is subject to many U.S. federal, U.S. state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data privacy protection, which require, among other things, maintaining policies and procedures to protect the non-public confidential information of customers and employees. The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including Comerica and its subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the disclosure. Other laws and regulations, at the international, federal and state levels, limit Comerica&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. \n\nOn November 18, 2021, the federal banking regulators issued the final rule regarding Computer-Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Service Providers, which became effective April 1, 2022 and requires a bank to notify its primary federal regulator of certain cybersecurity incidents within thirty-six (36) hours after the bank determines that a cybersecurity incident has occurred. The rule defines what constitutes a reportable incident and also requires bank service providers to provide notice to their respective banking organization customers of certain cybersecurity incidents. \n\nData privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer&#8217;s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Additionally, in November of 2020, California voters approved the adoption of the California Privacy Rights Act (the &#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which is effective as of January 1, 2023, and which, among other things, expands certain consumer rights granted under the CCPA. Comerica has a physical footprint in California and is required to comply with both the CCPA and CPRA. Similar laws have also been adopted by other states, including the state of Colorado, where Comerica does business but does not have banking centers, and may be adopted by other states in the future. For example, the Michigan legislature is currently considering a consumer privacy rights law, which could potentially impact Comerica due to its physical presence in Michigan. The federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation. \n\nLike other lenders, Comerica Bank and other of Comerica&#8217;s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (&#8220;FCRA&#8221;), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on Comerica and its subsidiaries. \n\nFDIC Insurance Assessments \n\nThe DIF provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to $250,000 per depositor in each deposit account category. Comerica's subsidiary banks are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if, for example, criticized loans and/or other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases. For 2022, Comerica&#8217;s FDIC insurance expense totaled $31 million. \n\nOn October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that would increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within eight years. This plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. Based on the FDIC&#8217;s recent projections, however, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates. The increased assessment would improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline, consistent with the FDIC&#8217;s Amended Restoration Plan. The rule is effective as of January 1, 2023. \n\nAnti-Money Laundering Regulations \n\nComerica is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities (\"AML laws\"). This category of laws includes the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or USA PATRIOT Act. \n\nThe AML laws and their implementing regulations require insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The AML laws and their regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. To comply with these obligations, Comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices, procedures, and controls. \n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation \n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC-administered sanctions take many different forms. For example, sanctions may include: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or &#8220;specially designated nationals&#8221; of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). OFAC also publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. \n\nInterstate Banking and Branching \n\nThe Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (the &#8220;Interstate Act&#8221;), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, permits a bank holding company, with FRB approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company's home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, prior to and following the proposed acquisition, control no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent of such deposits in that state (or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 percent). The Interstate Act, as amended, also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states, subject to various conditions. In the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations, de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the \n\nbranch. A bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions. \n\nComerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank, Comerica Bank, with banking centers in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan, as well as Canada. \n\nSource of Strength and Cross-Guarantee Requirements \n\nFederal law and FRB regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations. The FRB may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, Comerica may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress. Capital loans by Comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks. In the event of Comerica&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by Comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary banks would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. \n\nSimilarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC (either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure), the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the FDIC&#8217;s loss, subject to certain exceptions. An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution. \n\nSupervisory and Enforcement Powers of Federal and State Banking Agencies \n\nThe FRB and other federal and state banking agencies have broad supervisory and enforcement powers, including, without limitation, and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law, the power to conduct examinations and investigations, impose nonpublic supervisory agreements, issue cease and desist orders, terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject Comerica or its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers and directors of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties. Bank regulators regularly examine the operations of bank holding companies and banks, and the results of these examinations, as well as certain supervisory and enforcement actions, are confidential and may not be made public. \n\nResolution Plans \n\nAs a depository institution with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets, Comerica Bank is required to periodically file a resolution plan with the FDIC. On April 16, 2019, the FDIC released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (&#8220;ANPR&#8221;) with respect to the FDIC&#8217;s bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm&#8217;s size, complexity and risk profile. In connection with this rulemaking, the FDIC placed a moratorium on resolution plans until the rulemaking process was complete. \n\nOn June 25, 2021, the FDIC lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets. Under the FDIC&#8217;s Statement on Resolution Plans for IDIs , an institution will be required to submit resolution plans when it has $100 billion or more in total assets as determined based upon the average of the institution&#8217;s four most recent Reports of Condition and Income. \n\nIncentive-Based Compensation \n\nComerica is subject to guidance issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers senior executives as well as other employees who, either individually or as part of a group, have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements (i) should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) should be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (iii) should be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. Banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles. Where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements, they should be promptly addressed. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness, particularly if the organization is not taking \n\nprompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Similar to other large banking organizations, Comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the FRB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Texas Department of Banking since 2011. As part of that review, Comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization, the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan&#8217;s design and implementation. Comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Comerica. It is Comerica&#8217;s intent to continue monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation practices. \n\nIn 2016, the FRB, OCC and several other federal financial regulators revised and re-proposed rules to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements, or any feature of any such arrangement, at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. This proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in June 2010. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentive-based payments for designated executives and significant risk-takers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institution's size, capital or overall risk tolerance. Moreover, incentive-based compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting. Further, the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation. Comerica is monitoring the development of this rule. \n\nThe Volcker Rule \n\nComerica is prohibited under the Volcker Rule from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for its own account and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (\"Covered Funds\"). The Volcker Rule regulations contain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting and trading in U.S. government and agency obligations, and permit certain ownership interests in certain types of Covered Funds to be retained. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of Covered Funds under certain conditions. The Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. Comerica has compliance programs required by the Volcker Rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in Covered Funds. \n\nIn October 2019, the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the Volcker Rule finalized changes designed to simplify compliance with the Volcker Rule. The final rule formalized a three-tiered approach to compliance program requirements for banking entities based on their level of trading activity. As a banking entity with &#8220;moderate&#8221; trading assets and liabilities (less than $20 billion), Comerica is subject to simplified compliance requirements. In June 2020, regulators finalized a rule further modifying the Volcker Rule&#8217;s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring Covered Funds. The final rule modifies three areas of the rule by: streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule; addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds; and permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address. Comerica continues to follow Volcker Rule developments. \n\nDerivative Transactions \n\nAs a state member bank, Comerica Bank may engage in derivative transactions, as permitted by applicable Texas and federal law. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act contains a comprehensive framework for over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives transactions. Even though many of the requirements do not impact Comerica directly, since Comerica Bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or major swap participant, Comerica continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly. On November 5, 2018, the CFTC issued a final rule that sets the permanent aggregate gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis exception from the definition of swap dealer at $8 billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding 12 months. Comerica's swap dealing activities for purposes of the de minimis exception are currently below this threshold. \n\nThe initial margin requirements for non-centrally cleared swaps and security-based swaps were effective for Comerica&#8217;s swap and security-based swap counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants on September 1, 2022, and such counterparties are required to collect initial margin from Comerica. The initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with non-cleared swaps activity. \n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and Certain Recent Consumer Finance Regulations \n\nComerica is subject to regulation by the CFPB, which has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, including Comerica Bank, and their depositary affiliates. \n\nComerica is also subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. In recent years, state authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of Comerica&#8217;s activities and to various aspects of its business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. \n\nUNDERWRITING APPROACH \n\nThe loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk, so proper loan underwriting is critical to Comerica's long-term financial success. Comerica extends credit to businesses, individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice. During the loan underwriting process, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed, and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated. Important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include: \n\n&#8226; People: Including the competence, integrity and succession planning of customers. \n\n&#8226; Purpose: The legal, logical and productive purposes of the credit facility. \n\n&#8226; Payment: Including the source, timing and probability of payment. \n\n&#8226; Protection: Including obtaining alternative sources of repayment, securing the loan, as appropriate, with collateral and/or third-party guarantees and ensuring appropriate legal documentation is obtained. \n\n&#8226; Perspective: The risk/reward relationship and pricing elements (cost of funds; servicing costs; time value of money; credit risk). \n\nComerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk, the related costs and the expected return, while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions. Loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected risk-adjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrower's ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates. \n\nCredit Approval and Monitoring \n\nApproval of new loan exposure and oversight and monitoring of Comerica's loan portfolio is the joint responsibility of the Credit Risk Management and Decisioning department and the Credit Underwriting department (collectively referred to as &#8220;Credit&#8221;), plus the business units (&#8220;Line&#8221;). Credit assists the Line with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis, including an assessment of the borrower's business model, balance sheet, cash flow and collateral. The approval of new loan exposure is the joint responsibility of Credit Risk Management and Decisioning and the Line. Each commercial borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by Credit Risk Management and Decisioning. Further, Credit updates the assigned internal risk rating as new information becomes available as a result of periodic reviews of credit quality, a change in borrower performance or approval of new loan exposure. The goal of the internal risk rating framework is to support Comerica's risk management capability, including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio, predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk. Finally, the Line and Credit (including its Credit Analytics and Strategy department) work together to insure the overall credit risk within the loan portfolio is consistent with the bank&#8217;s Credit Risk Appetite. \n\nCredit Policy \n\nComerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies. Comerica's credit policies provide Line and Credit Personnel with a framework of sound underwriting practices and potential loan structures. These credit policies also provide the framework for loan committee approval authorities based on its internal risk-rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and Comerica's legal lending limit. Credit, in conjunction with the Line, monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary. New or modified policies/guidelines require approval by the Strategic Credit Committee, chaired by Comerica's Chief Credit Officer and comprised of senior credit, market and risk management executives. \n\nCommercial Loan Portfolio \n\nCommercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower's operations. The underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below: \n\n&#8226; The borrower's business model and industry characteristics. \n\n&#8226; Periodic review of financial statements including financial statements audited by an independent certified public accountant when appropriate. \n\n&#8226; The proforma financial condition including financial projections. \n\n&#8226; The borrower's sources and uses of funds. \n\n&#8226; The borrower's debt service capacity. \n\n&#8226; The guarantor's financial strength. \n\n&#8226; A comprehensive review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, to determine the advance rates. \n\n&#8226; Physical inspection of collateral and audits of receivables, as appropriate. \n\nFor additional information specific to certain businesses within our commercial portfolio, please see the caption &#8220;Concentrations of Credit Risk\" starting on page F- 20 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nCommercial Real Estate (CRE) Loan Portfolio \n\nComerica's CRE loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes loans to real estate developers and investors and loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Comerica's CRE loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators. Our loan-to-value limitations are, in certain cases, more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. CRE loans generally require cash equity. CRE loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. There are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor. For additional information specific to our CRE loan portfolio, please see the caption &#8220;Commercial Real Estate Lending&#8221; on page F- 21 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nConsumer and Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolios \n\nComerica's consumer and residential mortgage loan underwriting includes an assessment of each borrower's personal financial condition, including a review of credit reports and related FICO scores (a type of credit score used to assess an applicant's credit risk) and verification of income and assets, as applicable. After origination, internal risk ratings are assigned based on payment status and product type. \n\nComerica does not originate subprime loans. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, Comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors. These credit factors include low FICO scores, poor patterns of payment history, high debt-to-income ratios and elevated loan-to-value. Comerica generally considers subprime FICO scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis (excluding loans with cash or near-cash collateral and adequate income to make payments) and below 660 for unsecured loans. Residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based. The remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market. Adjustable-rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs. For additional information specific to our residential real estate loan portfolio, please see the caption &#8220;Residential Real Estate Lending&#8221; on page F- 22 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nComerica&#8217;s relationship banking strategy relies heavily on the personal relationships and the quality of service provided by employees. Accordingly, Comerica aims to attract, develop and retain employees who can drive financial and strategic growth objectives and build long-term shareholder value. Key items related to Comerica&#8217;s human capital resources are described below. \n\nStructure . As of December 31, 2022, Comerica and its subsidiaries had 7,280 full-time and 369 part-time employees, primarily located in Comerica&#8217;s core markets of Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona and Florida. Comerica&#8217;s Chief Human Resources Officer reports directly to the Chairman, President and CEO and manages all aspects of the employee experience, including talent acquisition, diversity and inclusion, learning and development, talent management, compensation and benefits. \n\nThe Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board is tasked with reviewing Comerica&#8217;s human capital management strategy and talent development program, including recruitment, evaluations and development activities. This Committee also reviews Comerica&#8217;s employee diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as well as the results of those initiatives. The full Board is provided annual workforce updates. To enhance the Board&#8217;s understanding of Comerica's talent pipeline, the Board routinely meets with high-potential employees in formal and informal settings. \n\nProductivity . Comerica carefully manages the size of its workforce and reallocates resources as needed. As of December 31, 2022, Comerica&#8217;s total employee headcount, on a full-time equivalent basis, was 16 percent lower than as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, for 2022, Comerica managed an average of $17 million of loans and deposits per employee. \n\nDiversity . Comerica has an organization-wide focus to improve recruitment and retention of women and ethnic minorities especially in leadership positions through its diversity outreach, diversity awareness and learning program and leadership development programs. As of December 31, 2022, Comerica&#8217;s U.S. colleagues had the following attributes: \n\n##TABLE_START Female (%) Minority (%) Employees 64 42 \n\nOfficials and Managers (1) \n\n53 29 \n\nExecutive Officers (2) \n\n43 21 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Based on EEO-1 job classifications. \n\n(2) Using Securities and Exchange Commission definition. \n\nComerica was recognized in 2022 as a Best Employer for Women by Forbes, included on Newsweek&#8217;s 2023 list of America&#8217;s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity and received five stars &#8211; the highest marking &#8211; in the category of governance as part of the 2022 Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility Corporate Inclusion Index. Additionally, Comerica again received a perfect score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index (for LGBTQ+ equality). \n\nThere are ten Comerica Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), consisting of employees with common interests organized to promote professional development, social networking, awareness and inclusion, social impact and talent attraction and retention. The ERGs help support and sustain Comerica's diversity and inclusion model. These groups include Comerica African American Network; Comerica Asian Indian Association; Comerica Asian and Pacific Islander; European Connection; Mi Gente; PRISM &#8211; LGBTQ+; Quantitative Professionals; Veteran&#8217;s Leadership Network; Women&#8217;s Forum and Young Professionals. \n\nCompensation and Benefits . Comerica strives to provide pay, benefits, and programs that help meet the varying needs of its employees. Compensation and benefits include market-competitive pay, retirement programs, broad-based bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, health and welfare benefits, an employee assistance program, financial counseling, paid time off, family leave and flexible work schedules. In 2022, Comerica increased its minimum wage from $17 per hour to $18 per hour. Additionally, for 2023, Comerica held employee health and welfare premiums steady, absorbing the rising cost of medical coverage. Comerica periodically examines the main components of compensation, like salaries and bonuses, by grade level and position to ensure similar positions receive similar pay to the extent other factors can be equalized ( e.g. , time in position, performance, education). Comerica also considers equitable benefits and looks at policies and practices that potentially drive inequities. Solicitation of salary history from applicants is prohibited. \n\nAttraction, Development and Retention . Comerica measures the success of its talent acquisition strategy on speed and quality of acquisition, diversity of its applicant pool, and new colleague retention. In addition, overall performance metrics are tracked for each key business line. Sourcing strategies and support structures are evaluated and modified to ensure that performance targets are met consistently. \n\nComerica operates and continues to evolve multiple internal programs to support the development and retention of its colleagues, including Comerica University, internal Leadership Development, Emerging Leaders, and Senior Leadership programs designed to develop high potential employees, a Future-Ready Technology skills program to help re- and up-skill Technology colleagues, a Managing Essentials Certificate series for managers and organizational change management learning for all colleagues. In 2022, over 9,900 skills-based titles were offered to Comerica colleagues and an average of around 25 hour s of training per employee were completed. Comerica also supports its employees&#8217; involvement in external development programs and volunteerism. All full-time colleagues are granted up to 8 hours of PTO annually, and all part-time colleagues are granted up to 4 hours of PTO annually to use for volunteer events. This includes volunteer opportunities related and unrelated to Comerica. \n\nComerica&#8217;s investment in its employees has resulted in a long-tenured workforce, with average tenure of around 12 year s of service. Of the approximately 2,750 open employee positions filled in 2022, 57% were filled by external hires and 43% positions were filled by internal hires. Employee turnover for 2022 was approximately 20%. In 2021, Comerica conducted its \n\nsecond enterprise-wide employee engagement survey, with approximately 80% of colleagues participating, and plans to launch its third engagement survey in 2023. \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\nComerica maintains an Internet website at www.comerica.com where the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. \n\nIn addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in Comerica's SEC reports (accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on Comerica's website at www.comerica.com ), the factors contained below, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance. \n\nCREDIT RISK \n\n&#8226; Changes in customer behavior due to outside factors may adversely impact Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIndividual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Comerica's control, such as pandemics, inflation, military conflicts, labor shortages, supply chain constraints, fuel prices, energy costs, tariffs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect Comerica's ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements. \n\nFurther, difficult economic conditions, such as a recession, may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Comerica, Comerica's customers and others in the financial institutions industry. \n\n&#8226; Unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect Comerica's financial results. \n\nAlthough Comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. Under such circumstances, as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, Comerica could experience an increase in the \n\nlevel of provision for credit losses and reserve for credit losses, which could adversely affect Comerica's financial results. Additionally, some of Comerica's loan portfolios have higher risk profiles relative to the rest of our portfolio, such as Technology and Life Sciences, automotive production and the leveraged transactions book. For more information, please see \"Leveraged Loans&#8221; starting on page F- 23 of the Financial Section of this report and \"Automotive Lending - Production\" starting on page F- 22 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\n&#8226; Declines in the businesses or industries of Comerica's customers could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect Comerica. \n\nComerica's business customer base consists, in part, of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive, commercial real estate, residential real estate and energy industries. These industries are sensitive to global economic conditions, supply chain factors and/or commodities prices. In particular, in 2022, loan balances in Dealer Services remained low and credit quality in automotive production remained under pressure due to lingering effects of shortages in parts which depressed manufacturing, and thus sales volumes. Additionally, certain segments of the commercial real estate industry have been under pressure due to rapidly rising interest rates, shifts in demand ( i.e., office, retail), labor and materials shortages and capital markets volatility. Finally, energy prices continued to fluctuate in 2022, and energy companies are expected to experience environmental pressure over the long-term. Any decline in one of these businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses or reduced loan demand, which in turn could adversely affect Comerica. For more information regarding certain of Comerica's lines of business, please see \"Concentrations of Credit Risk,\" \"Commercial Real Estate Lending,\" \"Automotive Lending - Dealer,\" \"Automotive Lending - Production,\" \"Residential Real Estate Lending,\" and &#8220;Energy Lending&#8221; starting on page F- 20 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nMARKET RISK \n\n&#8226; Governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact Comerica's financial condition and results of operations. \n\nMonetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the FRB, affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., and its monetary policies determine in large part Comerica's cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments. Changes in such policies, including changes in interest rates or changes in the FRB's balance sheet, influence the origination of loans, the value of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond Comerica's control and difficult to predict. Comerica's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies. \n\n&#8226; Fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect Comerica's net interest income and balance sheet. \n\nThe operations of financial institutions such as Comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and the trade, fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affect financial institutions' net interest income and the market value of its investment securities. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times in 2022; if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in the future, it will adversely affect the interest income Comerica earns on loans and investments. Further, while Comerica has taken steps to reduce its interest rate sensitivity, those actions, such as the execution of Comerica's hedging strategy, do not fully eliminate interest rate risk. For a discussion of Comerica's interest rate sensiti vity and risk management strategies, please see, &#8220;Market and Liquidi ty Risk&#8221; beginning on page F- 24 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\nDeposits make up a large portion of Comerica&#8217;s funding portfolio. Comerica's funding costs may increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits, or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. In 2022, interest expense increased $149 million from 2021, due to a rising rate environment. Higher funding costs will reduce Comerica's net interest margin and net interest income. \n\nVolatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions. Comerica's financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions. \n\n&#8226; Interest rates on Comerica's outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely affect its revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments. \n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Certain LIBOR tenors are no longer supported as of December 31, 2021, and the FCA has announced that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by Comerica, will cease to be supported after June 30, 2023. While Comerica stopped originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021, it still has remaining exposure to outstanding LIBOR-based products, including loans and derivatives. As of December 31, 2022, there are approximately $16.0 billion of LIBOR-based loans. Of these, approximately 18 percent have maturity dates prior to cessation, 46 percent mature after cessation but have fallback language and the remaining 36 percent are in process of remediation. \n\nComerica is currently issuing new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)-based and Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY)-based cash and derivative products. Comerica continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates, as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition. \n\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, such transition could: \n\n&#8226; adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenues and expenses associated with, Comerica&#8217;s floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR&#8217;s historical role in determining market interest rates globally; \n\n&#8226; adversely affect the value of Comerica&#8217;s floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR&#8217;s historical role in determining market interest rates globally; \n\n&#8226; prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to Comerica&#8217;s selection of alternative reference rates other than SOFR; and \n\n&#8226; result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based instruments. \n\nMore information regarding the LIBOR transition is available on page F- 27 under \"LIBOR Transition.\" \n\nThe manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on Comerica&#8217;s funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain. \n\nLIQUIDITY RISK \n\n&#8226; Comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations, support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities. \n\nComerica&#8217;s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility, a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, or deposit competition based on interest rates, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or adversely affect Comerica's ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. \n\nOther conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect Comerica&#8217;s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, Comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect Comerica's ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; counterparty availability; interest rate fluctuations; general economic conditions; and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing Comerica's funding transactions. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which Comerica has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. Further, Comerica's customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nAdditionally, if Comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms, or if Comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, Comerica&#8217;s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; Reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica and/or the holders of its securities. \n\nRating agencies regularly evaluate Comerica, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including Comerica's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that Comerica will maintain its current ratings. While recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets, future downgrades to Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on Comerica's results of operations or financial condition. If such a reduction placed Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings below investment grade, it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase Comerica's costs under such arrangements. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold. \n\n&#8226; The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Comerica. \n\nComerica's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led, and may further lead, to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose Comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Comerica's credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be monetized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to Comerica. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect, possibly materially, Comerica. \n\nTECHNOLOGY RISK \n\n&#8226; Comerica faces security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting Comerica&#8217;s colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect its business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. \n\nComerica&#8217;s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which Comerica is highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Comerica&#8217;s business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access Comerica&#8217;s network, products and services, its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. \n\nCyber attacks could include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in Comerica's systems or the systems of third parties, or other security breaches, and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems. As cyber threats continue to evolve, Comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of Comerica&#8217;s systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, Comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and Comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. \n\nAlthough Comerica has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to Comerica, including loss of customer data. Like other financial services firms, Comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks. Although to this date Comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks, future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Further, cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner. \n\nCyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at Comerica or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber attack on Comerica&#8217;s systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause Comerica serious negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to Comerica&#8217;s operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of its confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of its customers; or damage to Comerica&#8217;s or Comerica&#8217;s customers&#8217; and/or third parties&#8217; computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in Comerica&#8217;s security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact its results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, although Comerica maintains insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber losses (subject to policy terms and conditions), we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event. \n\n&#8226; Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus. \n\nAs cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including Comerica and its bank subsidiaries, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data. For more information regarding cybersecurity regulation, refer to the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section of this report. \n\nComerica receives, maintains and stores non-public personal information of Comerica&#8217;s customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled. For example, the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds, including Comerica. For more information regarding data privacy regulation, refer to the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section of this report. \n\nComerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information Comerica may store or maintain. Comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that Comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with Comerica&#8217;s current practices, it may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts Comerica&#8217;s operating results. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISK \n\n&#8226; Comerica&#8217;s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt Comerica&#8217;s business and adversely impact Comerica&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm. \n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout Comerica&#8217;s business and, as a result of its interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to Comerica&#8217;s own internal operational functions. Comerica's operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks. These networks are subject to infrastructure failures, ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages. Comerica's use of mobile and cloud technologies, as well as its hybrid work options permitting remote work, can heighten these and other operational risks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in Comerica's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. \n\nComerica relies on its employees and third parties in its day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of Comerica&#8217;s or of third-party systems or infrastructure, \n\nexpose Comerica to risk. For example, Comerica&#8217;s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to Comerica or to third parties with whom Comerica interacts or upon whom it relies. Although Comerica has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to Comerica, including loss of customer data. In addition, Comerica&#8217;s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems. \n\nComerica&#8217;s financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume and/or customer activity; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; cyber attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts. \n\nThe occurrence of any failure or interruption in Comerica's operations or information systems, or any security breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject Comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica. \n\n&#8226; Comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its delivery systems, and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations. \n\nComerica faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems. Third party vendors provide certain key components of Comerica's delivery systems, such as cloud-based computing, networking and storage services, cash services, payment processing services, recording and monitoring services, internet connections and network access, clearing agency services, card processing services and trust processing services. While Comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls, it does not control their operations. Further, while Comerica's vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations, these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk. In this context, any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect Comerica&#8217;s business operations, and result in financial loss, reputational harm, and/or regulatory action. \n\n&#8226; Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry, including those directly involving Comerica and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect Comerica or the financial services industry in general. \n\nComerica has been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that Comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of Comerica's efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's financial condition and operating results. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by Comerica's regulators that could materially adversely affect Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nComerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could adversely affect Comerica's results of operations and financial condition. \n\n&#8226; Comerica may incur losses due to fraud. \n\nFraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge, such as real-time payments. Fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving. Examples include but are not limited to: debit card/credit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials, employee fraud, information theft and other malfeasance. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud. Many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media. Further, as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud \n\nactivity, Comerica continues to invest in systems, resources, and controls to detect and prevent fraud. This will result in continued ongoing investments in the future. \n\n&#8226; Controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. \n\nControls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports Comerica files or submits under the Exchange Act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, due to certain inherent limitations. These limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake, or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in control systems, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \n\nCOMPLIANCE RISK \n\n&#8226; Changes in regulation or oversight, or changes in Comerica&#8217;s status with respect to existing regulations or oversight, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operations. \n\nComerica is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the U.S. Treasury, the Texas Department of Banking, the FDIC, the FRB, the OCC, the CFPB, the CFTC, the SEC, FINRA, DOL, MSRB and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which Comerica may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on Comerica's operations and ability to make acquisitions, investigations and limitations related to Comerica's securities, the classification of Comerica's assets and determination of the level of Comerica's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect Comerica's businesses or operations. \n\nFurther, even if such regulations or oversight do not change, Comerica's business may develop such that it may be subject to increased regulatory requirements. For example, if Comerica's asset size increases in the future and exceeds $100 billion in average total consolidated assets calculated over four consecutive financial quarters, Comerica will become a Category IV institution. Category IV institutions ($100 to $250 billion in assets) under the Tailoring Rules are subject to additional requirements, such as certain enhanced prudential standards and monitoring and reporting certain risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms are, among other things, subject to (1) supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial basis, (2) requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and (3) certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements, including liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements. Comerica would also incur additional assessments under Regulation TT. If Comerica becomes subject to enhanced prudential standards, it will face more stringent requirements or limitations on its business, as well as increased compliance costs, and, depending on its levels of capital and liquidity, stress test results and other factors, may be limited in the types of activities it may conduct and be limited as to how it utilizes capital. Further, Comerica may be subject to heightened expectations, which could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, higher penalties, and more severe consequences if it is unable to meet those expectations. \n\n&#8226; Compliance with stringent capital requirements may adversely affect Comerica. \n\nComerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards, as set forth in the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section of this report. These requirements, and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity, or any existing requirements that Comerica becomes subject to as a result of its increased asset size, could adversely affect Comerica's ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases, or could require Comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition and/or existing shareholders. Maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce Comerica's profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Tax regulations could be subject to potential legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations. \n\nFederal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified and/or modified by legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time. Any such changes could adversely affect Comerica, either directly, or indirectly as a result of effects on Comerica's customers. For example, the U.S. government recently enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a 15% minimum tax based on &#8220;adjusted financial statement income&#8221; for certain large corporations, which is effective in 2023, and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022. In addition, the current administration has announced a \n\nproposal to increase such excise tax to 4%. While Comerica does not believe that the IRA will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, any future corporate tax legislation could have that effect. \n\nSTRATEGIC RISK \n\n&#8226; Damage to Comerica&#8217;s reputation could damage its businesses. \n\nReputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust. Such risks include compliance issues, operational challenges, or a strategic, high profile event. Comerica's business is based on the trust of its customers, communities, and entire value chain, which makes managing reputational risk extremely important. News or other publicity that impairs Comerica's reputation, or the reputation of the financial services industry generally, can therefore cause significant harm to Comerica&#8217;s business and prospects. Further, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding Comerica, whether or not true, may result in harm to Comerica&#8217;s prospects. \n\n&#8226; Comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market, and deliver new products and services to its customers. \n\nThe financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer satisfaction. As well, the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Comerica's future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands, meet regulatory requirements, and create additional efficiencies in Comerica's operations. Comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Competitive product and pricing pressures within Comerica's markets may change. \n\nComerica operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates. Comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise, the range of products and services offered, pricing and reputation, convenience, quality of service, responsiveness to customer needs and the overall customer relationship. Comerica's competitors include financial institutions of all sizes. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in Comerica's markets, may have a broader array of products and structure alternatives and, due to their size, may more easily absorb credit losses. Some of Comerica's competitors (larger or smaller) may have more liberal lending policies and and aggressive pricing standards for loans, deposits and services. Increasingly, Comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities, such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer. \n\nAdditionally, the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation. For more information, see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section of this report. Such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology, personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions, including Comerica, to engage in certain activities. Comerica's competitors may be subject to significantly different or lesser regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered. Some competitors may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the cost of regulations. \n\nIn addition to banks, Comerica and its banking subsidiaries also face competition from financial intermediaries, including savings and loan associations, consumer and commercial finance companies, leasing companies, venture capital funds, credit unions, investment banks, insurance companies and securities firms. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies, with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including crowdfunding, digital wallets and money transfer services. The ability of non-banks to provide services previously limited to traditional banks has intensified competition. Because non-banks are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. \n\nIf Comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n&#8226; The introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect Comerica's business. \n\nComerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products. If Comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs, it could result in Comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material adverse effect on its business. Recently Comerica expanded its presence in the Southeastern and Mountain West regions of the U.S. If Comerica's expansion is not successful, it could adversely impact Comerica's expenses. \n\n&#8226; Management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations. \n\nThe financial services industry is very competitive. Comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. While management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships, Comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact Comerica's earnings. \n\n&#8226; Management's ability to retain key officers and employees may change. \n\nComerica's future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel. Comerica's future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and Comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for Comerica to hire personnel over time. The increased prevalence of remote work environments has intensified the competition for talent as job opportunities may be less constrained by physical geography. \n\nFurther, Comerica's ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. In 2016, the FRB, OCC and several other federal financial regulators revised and re-proposed rules to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements, or any feature of any such arrangement, at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes Comerica. For these larger institutions, the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentive-based payments for designated executives and significant risk-takers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institution's size, capital or overall risk tolerance. Moreover, incentive-based compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting. Further, the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation. Accordingly, Comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions (as referenced above) or companies in other industries, which may not be subject to the same requirements. \n\nComerica's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, or Comerica's inability to attract and retain skilled employees. \n\n&#8226; Any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to Comerica's business and operations. \n\nDifficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent Comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition, or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected. \n\nFurther, the assimilation of any acquired entity's customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of Comerica's businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect Comerica's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. These matters could have an adverse effect on Comerica for an undetermined period. Comerica would be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of Comerica. \n\nGENERAL RISK \n\n&#8226; General political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected. \n\nLocal, domestic, and international events including economic, financial market, political and industry-specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. The economic environment and market conditions in which Comerica operates continue to be uncertain. The U.S. economy is facing headwinds from recessionary pressures, surging interest rates, high inflation, the end of fiscal stimulus, lower housing market activity and weak export markets abroad. Foreign developments pose additional headwinds, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, uncertainties about China&#8217;s reopening and the impact of tighter monetary policy across much of the global economy. While some of these headwinds are expected to dissipate in 2023, U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of further credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the U.S. Conditions related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts, changes in trade policies and other factors, such as real estate values, energy prices, state and local municipal budget deficits, government spending and the U.S. national debt, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica. \n\n&#8226; Inflation could negatively impact Comerica's business, profitability and stock price. \n\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact Comerica profitability by negatively impacting its fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting the demand for its products and services. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for Comerica's products and services. If significant inflation continues, Comerica's business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease the appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing Comerica's stock price to suffer. \n\n&#8226; Methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective. \n\nInstruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market, liquidity, technology, operational, compliance, financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, Comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nFor more information regarding risk management, please see \"Risk Management\" starting on page F- 15 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\n&#8226; Catastrophic events, including pandemics, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and Comerica. \n\nActs of terrorism, cyber-terrorism, political unrest, war, civil disturbance, armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters (including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, droughts and floods), global health risks or pandemics, or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us. Comerica&#8217;s business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios, and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect Comerica's operating results. \n\nIn particular, certain of the regions where Comerica operates, including California, Texas, and Florida, are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters. These types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies, Comerica's business and customers, and have caused physical damage to Comerica's property in these regions. \n\nIn addition, COVID-19 and concerns regarding the extent to which it may continue to spread, including the currently discovered and potential future variants of COVID-19, have affected, and may increasingly affect, international trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, and other economic activities. COVID-19 or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact Comerica's and/or its clients&#8217; costs, demand for its clients&#8217; products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect Comerica's business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nFurther, catastrophic events may have an impact on Comerica's customers and in turn, on Comerica. \n\nIn addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular, which could harm Comerica's operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm Comerica's stock price and may limit the capital resources available to Comerica and its customers. This could have a material adverse impact on Comerica's operating results, revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of Comerica's common stock. \n\n&#8226; Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect Comerica's operations, businesses and customers. \n\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt Comerica's operations or those of its clients or third parties on which it relies, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or taxes, could increase expenses and undermine business strategies. In addition, Comerica's reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of practices related to climate change, including its involvement, or its clients&#8217; involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions Comerica makes to continue to conduct or change its activities in response to considerations relating to climate change, including the setting of climate-related goals, commitments and targets. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, Comerica is advancing its processes to embed climate risk considerations into risk management strategies such as market, credit and operational risks; however, because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable, risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure. \n\n&#8226; Changes in accounting standards could materially impact Comerica's financial statements. \n\nFrom time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Comerica&#8217;s financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. \n\n&#8226; Comerica's accounting estimates and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. \n\nAccounting estimates and processes are fundamental to how Comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting estimates and processes so they comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). In some cases, management must select an accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in the Company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. \n\nManagement has identified certain accounting estimates as being critical because they require management's judgment to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. Comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding management's judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, Comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; starting on page F- 31 of the Financial Section of this report and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements starting on page F- 43 of the Financial Section of this report. \n\n&#8226; Comerica's stock price can be volatile. \n\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. Comerica's stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things: \n\n&#8226; Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations. \n\n&#8226; Recommendations or projections by securities analysts. \n\n&#8226; Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to Comerica. \n\n&#8226; News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry. \n\n&#8226; Perceptions in the marketplace regarding Comerica and/or its competitors. \n\n&#8226; New technology used, or services offered, by competitors. \n\n&#8226; Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving Comerica or its competitors. \n\n&#8226; Changes in dividends and capital returns. \n\n&#8226; Changes in government regulations. \n\n&#8226; Cyclical fluctuations. \n\n&#8226; Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts. \n\n&#8226; Activity by short sellers and changing government restrictions on such activity. \n\nGeneral market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economy; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit loss trends, among other factors, could also cause Comerica's stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. \n\nFor the above and other reasons, the market price of Comerica's securities may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the securities, and investors should consider this before relying on the market prices of Comerica's securities when making an investment decision. \n\n"

The Corporation's major business segments are the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. Information about the activities of the Corporation's business segments is provided in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nAs a financial institution, the Corporation's principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. The Corporation also provides other products and services that meet the financial needs of customers which generate noninterest income, the Corporation's secondary source of revenue. Growth in loans, deposits and noninterest income is affected by many factors, including economic conditions in the markets the Corporation serves, the financial requirements and economic health of customers and the ability to add new customers and/or increase the number of products used by current customers. Success in providing products and services depends on the financial needs of customers and the types of products desired. \n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The Corporation's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. When necessary, the Corporation uses reasonable assumptions to develop estimates that affect the consolidated results of operations. The most critical of these estimates are discussed in the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; section of this financial review. \n\nFull-Year 2022 compared to Full-Year 2021 \n\n&#8226; Net income decreased $17 million to $1.2 billion, driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income due to higher short-term rates and growth in investment securities and loans. Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) increased $430 million to $1.5 billion. (See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.) Diluted net income per common share was $8.47 in 2022 compared to $8.35 in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Average loans increased $1.4 billion, or 3 percent, to $50.5 billion, and included increases in Corporate Banking, general Middle Market, Equity Fund Services, Environmental Services, National Dealer Services, Commercial Real Estate and Entertainment Lending, partially offset by declines in Mortgage Banker Finance, Business Banking and Retail Banking. Excluding the impact of a $2.2 billion decline in average Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, which are reported within lines of business, average loans increased $3.6 billion, or 8 percent. \n\n&#8226; Average securities increased $3.3 billion, or 21 percent, to $19.0 billion, reflecting the investment of a portion of excess liquidity into mortgage-backed securities, partly offset by maturities of Treasury securities. \n\n&#8226; Average deposits decreased $2.2 billion, or 3 percent, to $75.5 billion. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased $2.8 billion, or 8 percent, reflecting strategic deposit management and customers utilizing balances to fund business activities, partially offset by an increase in average noninterest bearing-deposits of $577 million, or 1 percent. \n\n&#8226; Net interest income increased $622 million to $2.5 billion, and the net interest margin increased 81 basis points to 3.02 percent, largely due to higher short-term rates and growth in loans and securities balances, partly offset by the net impact of PPP loans. \n\n&#8226; The provision for credit losses increased to an expense of $60 million, compared to a benefit of $384 million in 2021, which was primarily the result of loan growth and reflected strong credit metrics and a modest deterioration in economic forecasts. \n\n&#8226; Noninterest income decreased $55 million to $1.1 billion, reflecting decreases in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses), warrant-related income, card fees and investment banking fees, partially offset by increases in derivative income, risk management hedging income, brokerage fees and commercial lending fees. \n\n&#8226; Noninterest expenses increased $137 million to $2.0 billion, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense, operational losses, occupancy expense, travel and entertainment expense, FDIC insurance expense and consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in outside processing fee expense, non-salary pension expense and legal-related expenses. \n\n&#8226; The Corporation declared common dividends of $2.72 per share, returning $391 million to common shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation declared $23 million in preferred dividends. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following provides a comparative discussion of the Corporation's consolidated results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. A comparative discussion of results for 2021 compared to 2020 is provided in the \"Results of Operations\" section beginning on page F-4 of the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report. \n\nF-3 \n\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Average Balance Interest Average Rate Average Balance Interest Average Rate Average Balance Interest Average Rate Commercial loans (a) (b) $ 29,846 &#160; $ 1,278 &#160; 4.28 &#160; % $ 29,283 $ 1,009 3.45 % $ 32,144 $ 1,099 3.42 % Real estate construction loans 2,607 &#160; 132 &#160; 5.07 &#160; 3,609 123 3.40 3,912 147 3.76 Commercial mortgage loans 12,135 &#160; 513 &#160; 4.22 &#160; 10,610 305 2.88 9,839 320 3.25 Lease financing (c) 680 &#160; 21 &#160; 3.12 &#160; 596 (2) (0.37) 594 20 3.37 International loans 1,246 &#160; 56 &#160; 4.46 &#160; 1,063 33 3.14 1,028 37 3.61 Residential mortgage loans 1,776 &#160; 56 &#160; 3.16 &#160; 1,813 55 3.04 1,905 66 3.45 Consumer loans 2,170 &#160; 97 &#160; 4.49 &#160; 2,109 71 3.34 2,209 84 3.80 Total loans (d) 50,460 &#160; 2,153 &#160; 4.27 &#160; 49,083 1,594 3.25 51,631 1,773 3.44 Mortgage-backed securities (e) 16,199 &#160; 385 &#160; 2.14 &#160; 11,747 224 1.92 9,820 221 2.30 U.S. Treasury securities (f) 2,816 &#160; 29 &#160; 0.98 &#160; 3,977 56 1.42 3,612 70 1.98 Total investment securities 19,015 &#160; 414 &#160; 1.97 &#160; 15,724 280 1.79 13,432 291 2.21 Interest-bearing deposits with banks (g) 9,376 &#160; 104 &#160; 1.02 &#160; 18,729 27 0.14 10,203 28 0.27 Other short-term investments 174 &#160; 1 &#160; 0.81 &#160; 183 &#8212; 0.22 153 1 0.72 Total earning assets 79,025 &#160; 2,672 &#160; 3.27 &#160; 83,719 1,901 2.27 75,419 2,093 2.79 Cash and due from banks 1,481 &#160; 1,006 878 Allowance for loan losses (569) (729) (900) Accrued income and other assets 7,335 &#160; 6,156 5,749 Total assets $ 87,272 &#160; $ 90,152 $ 81,146 Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits (h) $ 28,347 &#160; 94 &#160; 0.33 &#160; $ 31,063 18 0.06 $ 26,798 72 0.27 Savings deposits 3,304 &#160; 2 &#160; 0.05 &#160; 3,018 &#8212; 0.01 2,454 1 0.03 Customer certificates of deposit 1,756 &#160; 5 &#160; 0.30 &#160; 2,110 4 0.21 2,626 27 1.02 Other time deposits 16 &#160; 1 &#160; 4.17 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 17 &#8212; 2.00 Foreign office time deposits 40 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1.05 &#160; 49 &#8212; 0.08 90 1 0.42 Total interest-bearing deposits 33,463 &#160; 102 &#160; 0.30 &#160; 36,240 22 0.06 31,985 101 0.31 Federal funds purchased 82 &#160; 3 &#160; 3.28 &#160; 2 &#8212; &#8212; 30 &#8212; 0.98 Other short-term borrowings 354 &#160; 14 &#160; 4.08 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 284 1 0.25 Medium- and long-term debt 2,818 &#160; 87 &#160; 3.07 &#160; 3,035 35 1.11 6,549 80 1.23 Total interest-bearing sources 36,717 &#160; 206 &#160; 0.56 &#160; 39,277 57 0.14 38,848 182 0.47 Noninterest-bearing deposits 42,018 &#160; 41,441 33,053 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,086 &#160; 1,481 1,554 Shareholders&#8217; equity 6,451 &#160; 7,953 7,691 Total liabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity $ 87,272 &#160; $ 90,152 $ 81,146 Net interest income/rate spread $ 2,466 &#160; 2.71 &#160; $ 1,844 2.13 $ 1,911 2.32 Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds &#160; 0.31 &#160; 0.08 0.22 Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) \n\n&#160; &#160; 3.02 &#160; % &#160; &#160; 2.21 % &#160; &#160; 2.54 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Interest income on commercial loans included $(25) million, $95 million and $70 million of business loan swap (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(b) Included Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans with average balances of $147 million, $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, interest income of $11 million, $111 million and $63 million and average yields of 7.25%, 4.77% and 2.49% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n(c) Included residual value adjustments totaling $3 million and $20 million, which impacted the average yield on loans by 1 basis point and 4 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no residual value adjustments recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\n(d) Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances reported and in the calculation of average rates. \n\n(e) Average balances included $(1.8) billion, $61 million and $213 million of unrealized (losses) gains for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively; yields calculated gross of these unrealized gains and losses. \n\n(f) Average balances included $(117) million, $27 million and $90 million of unrealized (losses) gains for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively; yields calculated gross of these unrealized gains and losses. \n\n(g) Average balances excluded $769 million, $375 million and $28 million of collateral posted and netted against derivative liability positions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively; yields calculated gross of derivative netting amounts. \n\n(h) Average balances excluded $128 million, $156 million and $279 million of collateral posted and netted against derivative liability positions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively; yields calculated gross of derivative netting amounts. \n\nF-4 \n\nRate/Volume Analysis \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022/2021 2021/2020 Increase (Decrease) Due to Rate Increase (Decrease) Due to Volume (a) Net Increase (Decrease) Decrease Due to Rate (Decrease) Increase Due to Volume (a) Net (Decrease) Increase Interest Income: Commercial loans $ 244 &#160; $ 25 &#160; $ 269 &#160; $ (1) $ (89) $ (90) Real estate construction loans 60 &#160; (51) 9 &#160; (14) (10) (24) Commercial mortgage loans 143 &#160; 65 &#160; 208 &#160; (37) 22 (15) Lease financing 21 &#160; 2 &#160; 23 &#160; (22) &#8212; (22) International loans 14 &#160; 9 &#160; 23 &#160; (5) 1 (4) Residential mortgage loans 2 &#160; (1) 1 &#160; (8) (3) (11) Consumer loans 24 &#160; 2 &#160; 26 &#160; (10) (3) (13) Total loans 508 &#160; 51 &#160; 559 &#160; (97) (82) (179) Mortgage-backed securities 5 &#160; 156 &#160; 161 &#160; (37) 40 3 U.S. Treasury securities (17) (10) (27) (20) 6 (14) Total investment securities (12) 146 &#160; 134 &#160; (57) 46 (11) Interest-bearing deposits with banks 170 &#160; (93) 77 &#160; (13) 12 (1) Other short-term investments 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; (1) &#8212; (1) Total interest income 667 &#160; 104 &#160; 771 &#160; (168) (24) (192) Interest Expense: Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits 85 &#160; (9) 76 &#160; (56) 2 (54) Savings deposits 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; (1) &#8212; (1) Customer certificates of deposit 2 &#160; (1) 1 &#160; (22) (1) (23) Other time deposits &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Foreign office time deposits &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; (1) &#8212; (1) Total interest-bearing deposits 89 &#160; (9) 80 &#160; (80) 1 (79) Federal funds purchased &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; Other short term borrowings &#8212; &#160; 14 &#160; 14 &#160; &#8212; (1) (1) Medium- and long-term debt 43 &#160; 9 &#160; 52 &#160; (7) (38) (45) Total interest expense 132 &#160; 17 &#160; 149 &#160; (87) (38) (125) Net interest income $ 535 &#160; $ 87 &#160; $ 622 &#160; $ (81) $ 14 $ (67) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. \n\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Gains and losses related to risk management interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to a floating rate and qualify as fair value hedges are included in interest expense on medium- and long-term debt. Additionally, the portion of gains and losses on risk management interest rate swaps that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges that relate to the earnings effect of the hedged loans during the period are included in loan interest income. Refer to the Analysis of Net Interest Income and the Rate/Volume Analysis tables above for an analysis of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and details of the components of the change in net interest income for 2022 compared to 2021 as well as 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nNet interest income was $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $622 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income reflected higher yields on earning assets and growth in mortgage-backed securities and loan balances, partially offset by higher rates paid on deposits and debt as well as the net impact of PPP loans. Net interest margin was 3.02 percent for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 81 basis points compared to 2.21 percent for the comparable period in 2021. The increase in net interest margin was driven by higher short-term rates as well as a decrease in lower-yielding deposits held with the Federal Reserve. \n\nAverage earning assets decreased $4.7 billion, due to declines of $9.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.2 billion in Treasury securities, partially offset by increases of $4.5 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $1.4 billion in loans. Average interest-bearing funding sources decreased $2.6 billion, reflecting a $2.8 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $434 million increase in short-term borrowings. \n\nThe Corporation utilizes various asset and liability management strategies to manage net interest income exposure to interest rate risk. Refer to the &#8220;Market and Liquidity Risk&#8221; section of this financial review for additional information regarding \n\nF-5 \n\nthe Corporation's asset and liability management policies and the &#8220;Balance Sheet and Capital Funds Analysis&#8221; section for further discussion on changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. \n\nProvision for Credit Losses \n\nThe provision for credit losses was an expense of $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a benefit of $384 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in provision was primarily the result of loan growth and reflected strong credit metrics and a modest deterioration in economic forecasts. Net loan charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $17 million, or 0.03 percent of average total loans, compared to net recoveries of $10 million, or 0.02 percent of average total loans, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Energy net charge-offs for the 2022 period totaled $3 million, compared to $48 million of Energy net recoveries recorded in the 2021 period, an increase of $51 million, which was partially offset by decreases of $12 million in general Middle Market and $9 million in Corporate Banking. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $35 million to $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nAn analysis of the allowance for credit losses and a summary of nonperforming assets are presented under the \"Credit Risk\" subheading in the \"Risk Management\" section of this financial review. For information regarding methodology used in the determination of allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nNoninterest Income \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Card fees $ 273 &#160; $ 298 $ 270 Fiduciary income 233 &#160; 231 209 Service charges on deposit accounts 195 &#160; 195 185 Commercial lending fees 109 &#160; 104 77 Derivative income 109 &#160; 99 67 Bank-owned life insurance 47 &#160; 43 44 Letter of credit fees 38 &#160; 40 37 Brokerage fees 21 &#160; 14 21 Other noninterest income (a) 43 &#160; 99 91 Total noninterest income $ 1,068 &#160; $ 1,123 $ 1,001 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. \n\nNoninterest income decreased $55 million to $1.1 billion, reflecting decreases in other noninterest income and card fees, partially offset by increases in derivative income, brokerage fees and commercial lending fees. Other noninterest income included decreases in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expenses), warrant-related income and investment banking fees, partially offset by an increase in risk management hedging income. \n\nCard fees consist primarily of interchange and other fee income earned on government prepaid card, commercial card, debit/Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card and merchant payment processing services. Card fees decreased $25 million, or 8 percent, reflecting a decline in government cards due to elevated activity from stimulus payments during 2021. Commercial card and merchant services increased from higher sales and payment processing volumes, respectively, while ATM surcharge income decreased. \n\nCommercial lending fees include fees assessed on the unused portion of lines of credit (unused commitment fees), syndication agent fees and loan servicing fees. These fees increased $5 million, or 3 percent, reflecting higher syndication agent fees from an increase in the number of deals, as well as an increase in loan commitment fees from growth and lower utilization rates on lines of credit. These increases were partially offset by a decline in loan service charges from lower application volumes, primarily in Mortgage Banker Finance. \n\nDerivative income consists of net gains and losses recognized on customer-initiated derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting positions. Derivative income increased $10 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to increases in energy and interest rate swap activity, partially offset by less favorable credit valuation adjustments. \n\nBrokerage fees are commissions earned for facilitating securities transactions for customers as well as other brokerage services provided. Brokerage fees increased $7 million, or 45 percent, driven by higher money market funds revenue from increased service fees, partially offset by lower transactional revenue related to mutual funds. \n\nOther noninterest income decreased $56 million, or 55 percent, as detailed below, driven by losses on deferred compensation assets, lower warrant-related income mostly due to elevated gains on monetization in the 2021 period and a decrease in investment banking fees from a decline in the average size and number of deals. These were partially offset by higher risk management hedging income related to an increase in price alignment income received for centrally cleared risk management positions. \n\nF-6 \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Securities trading income $ 13 &#160; $ 7 $ 8 Risk management hedging income (a) 8 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; Investment banking fees 4 &#160; 11 11 Principal investing and warrant-related income (b) (4) 26 18 Deferred compensation asset returns (c) (18) 14 16 All other noninterest income 40 &#160; 41 38 Other noninterest income $ 43 &#160; $ 99 $ 91 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Centrally-cleared derivative positions are settled daily based on derivative fair values and the party receiving net settlement amounts pays price alignment, based on an earning rate, to the party making settlement payments. Accordingly, the Corporation may recognize risk management hedging income consisting of price alignment income or expense depending on the fair value of its positions. \n\n(b) Includes changes in value of shares obtained through monetization of warrants, previously reported in securities trading income. \n\n(c) Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. \n\nNoninterest Expenses \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Salaries and benefits expense $ 1,208 &#160; $ 1,133 $ 1,019 Outside processing fee expense 251 &#160; 266 242 Occupancy expense 175 &#160; 161 156 Software expense 161 &#160; 155 154 Equipment expense 50 &#160; 50 49 Advertising expense 38 &#160; 35 35 FDIC insurance expense 31 &#160; 22 33 Other noninterest expenses 84 &#160; 39 66 Total noninterest expenses $ 1,998 &#160; $ 1,861 $ 1,754 ##TABLE_END\n\nNoninterest expenses increased $137 million to $2.0 billion, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense, operational losses, occupancy expense, travel and entertainment expense, FDIC insurance expense and consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in outside processing fee expense, non-salary pension expense and legal-related expenses. \n\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $75 million, or 7 percent, reflecting increases from annual merit adjustments, performance- and stock-based compensation, contract labor and severance costs, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation expense (offset in other noninterest income). \n\nOutside processing fee expense decreased $15 million, or 5 percent, reflecting a decline in data processing support for PPP loans and lower volumes of government card transactions tied to card fee revenues. \n\nOccupancy expense increased $14 million, or 8 percent, largely due to lease termination costs and accelerated amortization related to closures of bank branches and offices, as well as rent on newly leased corporate facilities. \n\nFDIC insurance expense increased $9 million, or 41 percent, reflecting higher assessment rates in 2022 primarily driven by a $16.9 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, declining from elevated levels seen in 2021, which had a punitive impact on the assessment rate. \n\nOther noninterest expenses increased $45 million, or 116 percent, driven by increases in operational losses, travel and entertainment expense and consulting fees, partially offset by decreases in non-salary pension expense and legal-related expenses. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the above detail included expenses for certain modernization initiatives related to the transformation of the retail banking delivery model, alignment of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platforms totaling $38 million, comprised of transitional real estate costs ($13 million reported in occupancy expense), asset impairments and consulting fees ($11 million reported in other noninterest expenses) as well as contract labor and severance costs ($14 million reported in salaries and benefits expense). \n\nIncome Taxes and Related Items \n\nThe provision for income taxes was $325 million in 2022, compared to $322 million in 2021. Net deferred tax assets were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $9 million at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the components of net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets of $1.4 billion were evaluated for realization and it was determined that a valuation allowance of $5 million for federal foreign tax credits and certain state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards was needed at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. \n\nF-7 \n\nFor further information on the Corporation&#8217;s valuation policy for deferred tax assets, refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. \n\nSTRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS \n\nThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. \n\nNet interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. \n\nThe following table presents net income (loss) by business segment. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Commercial Bank $ 1,052 &#160; 85 &#160; % $ 1,329 89 % $ 668 90 % Retail Bank 80 &#160; 6 &#160; 43 3 2 &#8212; Wealth Management 107 &#160; 9 &#160; 124 8 78 10 1,239 &#160; 100 &#160; % 1,496 100 % 748 100 % Finance (93) (331) (253) Other 5 &#160; 3 2 Total $ 1,151 &#160; &#160; $ 1,168 &#160; $ 497 ##TABLE_END\n\nF-8 \n\nThe following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business segments for 2022 compared to 2021. \n\nCommercial Bank \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, Percent Change (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Change Earnings summary: Net interest income $ 1,753 $ 1,574 $ 179 11% Provision for credit losses 32 (346) 378 n/m Noninterest income 607 663 (56) (9) Noninterest expenses 963 870 93 11 Provision for income taxes 313 384 (71) (19) Net income $ 1,052 $ 1,329 $ (277) (21) Net credit-related charge-offs (recoveries) $ 21 $ (12) $ 33 n/m Selected average balances: Loans (a) $ 43,481 $ 41,801 $ 1,680 4 % Deposits 42,584 45,602 (3,018) (7) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Included PPP loans with average balances of $100 million and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . \n\nn/m - not meaningful \n\nAverage loans increased $1.7 billion, reflecting increases in Corporate Banking, general Middle Market, Equity Fund Services, Environmental Services, National Dealer Services, Commercial Real Estate and Entertainment, partially offset by decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance and Business Banking (driven by the decline in PPP balances). Average deposits decreased $3.0 billion, reflecting decreases in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by increases in Energy and Commercial Real Estate, due to strategic deposit management and customers utilizing balances to fund business activities. The Commercial Bank's net income decreased $277 million to $1.1 billion. Net interest income increased $179 million due to an increase in loan income, partially offset by higher allocated net FTP charges and a decline in PPP loan fees. The provision for credit losses increased $378 million to an expense of $32 million, which primarily resulted from loan growth and reflected strong credit metrics and a modest deterioration in economic forecasts. Net credit-related charge-offs were $21 million, an increase of $33 million, primarily due to an increase in Energy net charge-offs, partially offset by decreases in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking net charge-offs. Noninterest income decreased $56 million, driven by lower warrant-related income as well as a decline in card fees due to higher activity in 2021 from stimulus payments.

These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program. \n\nSince the inception of the share repurchase program in 2010, a total of 97.2 million shares have been authorized for repurchase. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. The Corporation believes that share repurchases will resume in 2023, although the timing and actual amount of share repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation's earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth and the macroeconomic outlook. \n\nThe Corporation continues to target a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of approximately 10 percent with active capital management. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation's CET1 capital ratio was 10.00 percent, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to December 31, 2021. \n\nThe Corporation is subject to the capital adequacy standards under the Basel III regulatory framework (Basel III). This regulatory framework establishes comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as well as overall capital adequacy standards. \n\nUnder Basel III, regulatory capital comprises CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders' equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. \n\nF-14 \n\nThe Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors. \n\nThe following table presents the minimum ratios required. \n\n##TABLE_START Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 Capital conservation buffer (a) 2.5 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio) 4.0 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity tier 1 capital, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. \n\nThe Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Capital/Assets Ratio Capital/Assets Ratio Common equity tier 1 (a) $ 7,884 &#160; 10.00 &#160; % $ 7,064 10.13 % Tier 1 risk-based (a) 8,278 &#160; 10.50 &#160; 7,458 10.70 Total risk-based 9,817 &#160; 12.45 &#160; 8,608 12.35 Leverage 8,278 &#160; 9.55 &#160; 7,458 7.74 Common shareholders' equity 4,787 &#160; 5.60 &#160; 7,503 7.93 Tangible common equity (a) 4,143 &#160; 4.89 &#160; 6,857 7.30 Risk-weighted assets 78,871 &#160; 69,708 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the capital ratios required for an institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; by the standards developed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory capital requirements, capital ratio calculations and restrictions on the ability of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries to transfer assets to the Corporation. \n\nThe common shareholders' equity ratio decreased 233 basis points to 5.60 percent at December 31, 2022 primarily due to the change in unrealized losses in the Corporation's investment securities portfolio and, to a lesser extent, its cash flow hedge portfolio and defined benefit plan. The unrealized losses in the Corporation's available-for-sale investment security portfolio are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition which, in substantially all cases, are not expected to be realized. The tangible common equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, decreased 241 basis points to 4.89 percent for the same reasons. The impact of cumulative unrealized losses recorded within other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022 to both ratios was approximately 440 basis points. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT \n\nThe Corporation assumes various types of risk as a result of conducting business in the normal course. The Corporation's enterprise risk management framework provides a process for identifying, measuring, controlling and managing these risks. This framework incorporates a risk assessment process, a collection of risk committees that manage the Corporation's major risk elements and a risk appetite statement that outlines the levels and types of risks the Corporation accepts. The Corporation continuously enhances its enterprise risk framework with additional processes, tools and systems designed to not only provide management with deeper insight into the various existing and emerging risks in accordance with its appetite for risk, but also to improve the Corporation's ability to control those risks and ensure that appropriate consideration is received for the risks taken. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s front line employees, the first line of defense, are responsible for the day-to-day management and ownership of risks, including the identification, assessment, measurement and control of risks encountered as a part of the normal course of business. Each of the major risk categories are further monitored and measured by specialized risk managers in the second line of defense within the Enterprise Risk Division, who provide oversight as well as independent and effective challenge and guidance for the risk management activities of the organization. The Enterprise Risk Division, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for designing and managing the Corporation&#8217;s enterprise risk management framework and ensures effective risk management oversight. Risk management committees serve as a point of review and escalation for those risks \n\nF-15 \n\nwhich may have risk interdependencies or where risk levels may be nearing the limits outlined in the Corporation&#8217;s risk appetite statement. These committees comprise senior and executive management that represent views from both the lines of business and risk management. Internal Audit, the third line of defense, monitors and assesses the overall effectiveness of the risk management framework on an ongoing basis and provides an independent, objective assessment of the Corporation&#8217;s ability to manage and control risk to management and the Audit Committee of the Board. \n\nThe Enterprise Risk and Return Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is established by the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and responsible for governance over the risk management framework, providing oversight in managing the Corporation's aggregate risk position and reporting on the comprehensive portfolio of risks as well as the potential impact these risks can have on the Corporation's risk profile and resulting capital level. Capital provides the primary buffer for risk and also serves as a measuring tool when evaluating risk. The Enterprise Risk and Return Committee is principally composed of senior officers and executives representing the different risk areas and business units who are appointed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. \n\nThe Board's Enterprise Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chartered to assist the Board in promoting the best interests of the Corporation by overseeing policies and risk practices relating to enterprise-wide risk and ensuring compliance with bank regulatory obligations. Members of the Enterprise Risk Committee are selected such that the committee comprises individuals whose experiences and qualifications can lead to broad and informed views on risk matters facing the Corporation and the financial services industry. These include, but are not limited to, existing and emerging risk matters related to credit, market, liquidity, operational, technology, compliance and strategic conditions. A comprehensive risk report is submitted to the Enterprise Risk Committee each quarter providing management's view of the Corporation's aggregate risk position. \n\nFurther discussion and analyses of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of the Risk Management section in this financial review. \n\nCredit Risk \n\nCredit risk represents the risk of loss due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer or borrower performance. It arises any time funds are extended, committed, invested or otherwise exposed, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. The governance structure is administered through the Strategic Credit Committee. The Strategic Credit Committee is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy, credit risk management practices and required credit risk actions. The Strategic Credit Committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends, including exception levels, along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks. In order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process, various other corporate functions provide the resources for the Strategic Credit Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting and periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures in accordance with established credit policies and guidelines. Additionally, the Corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry, customer or guarantor, and selling participations and/or syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties. \n\nThe Credit Division manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy and providing business segment reporting support as necessary. The Enterprise Risk Division provides credible and well-documented challenge of overall portfolio credit risk, and other credit-related attributes of the Corporation's loan portfolios, with a particular emphasis on all attendant modeled results. The Corporation's Asset Quality Review function, a division of Internal Audit, audits the accuracy of internal risk ratings that are assigned by the lending and credit groups. The Special Assets Group is responsible for managing the recovery process on distressed or defaulted loans and loan sales. \n\nCredit Analytics and Strategy, within the Credit Division, provides comprehensive reporting on portfolio credit risk levels and trends, continuous assessment and verification of risk rating models, quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments and calculations of both expected and unexpected loss. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. \n\nF-16 \n\nThe following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 2021 Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans 1.24 &#160; % 1.26 % Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans 2.8x 2.3x Allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans 2.7x 2.3x ##TABLE_END\n\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $43 million from $618 million at December 31, 2021 to $661 million at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting loan growth and continued strong credit metrics as well as a modest deterioration in economic forecasts. Excess savings and pent-up demand from consumers, as well as tight labor markets, have supported the U.S. economy. However, there are headwinds from recessionary pressures, surging inflation, higher interest rates and the slowing housing market. Foreign developments pose additional headwinds, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, uncertainties about China&#8217;s reopening and the impact of tighter monetary policy across much of the global economy. \n\nThese factors shaped the 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast used by the Corporation in its CECL estimate at December 31, 2022. The U.S. economy is expected to contract marginally in the first half of 2023 before gradually normalizing to its trend growth rates. Certain economic variables, like oil prices, are expected to decrease as inflation normalizes. Forecasts for other key economic variables are generally consistent with those of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while interest rate forecasts reflect market expectations and recent guidance from the Federal Reserve. The following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Economic Variable Base Forecast Real GDP growth Contracts slightly in first and second quarters 2023, consistent with a mild recession, before recovering to a trend growth rate of around 2 percent by the end of the forecast period. Unemployment rate Increases to 4.7 percent by first quarter 2024 and remaining at that level through fourth quarter 2024. Corporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Spreads widen to 2.8 percent in first quarter 2023 before normalizing to 2.1 percent by the end of the forecast period. Oil Prices Prices gradually decline from current levels to $76 dollars by fourth quarter 2024. ##TABLE_END\n\nDue to the high degree of uncertainty regarding recessionary pressures, surging inflation and higher interest rates, management considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio, including more benign and more severe forecasts. \n\nRefer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses. \n\nAllowance for Loan Losses \n\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated, while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. The allowance for loan losses increased $22 million to $ 610 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $588 million at December 31, 2021. \n\nCollective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. The allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecisions and model imprecision. Credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to \n\nF-17 \n\nbusiness loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments totaled $51 million and $30 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nAnalysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe table below details net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of total loans by loan category. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 (dollar amounts in millions) Net Loan Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Ratio (a) Net Loan Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Ratio (a) Net Loan Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries) Ratio (a) Commercial $ 18 &#160; 0.06 &#160; % $ (15) (0.05 %) $ 198 0.62 % Commercial mortgage &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 0.02 (3) (0.03) International &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4 0.38 &#8212; &#8212; Residential mortgage (1) (0.03) (2) (0.11) &#8212; &#8212; Consumer &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 0.05 1 0.05 Total loans $ 17 &#160; 0.03 &#160; % $ (10) (0.02 %) $ 196 0.38 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of related average loans outstanding. \n\nNet loan charge-offs totaled $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a $27 million increase from net loan recoveries of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Commercial net charge-offs for the 2022 period included Energy net charge-offs totaling $3 million, compared to $48 million of Energy net recoveries recorded in the 2021 period, an increase of $51 million, which was partially offset by decreases of $12 million in general Middle Market and $9 million in Corporate Banking. \n\nAllocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Allocated Allowance Allowance Ratio (a) % (b) Allocated Allowance Allowance Ratio (a) % (b) December 31, Allowance for loan losses Business loans Commercial (c) $ 287 &#160; 0.93 &#160; % 58 &#160; % $ 293 1.00 % 60 % Real estate construction 38 &#160; 1.24 &#160; 6 &#160; 28 0.94 6 Commercial mortgage 200 &#160; 1.51 &#160; 25 &#160; 192 1.71 23 Lease financing 6 &#160; 0.78 &#160; 1 &#160; 6 0.97 1 International 10 &#160; 0.79 &#160; 2 &#160; 12 0.96 2 Total business loans 541 &#160; 1.10 &#160; 92 &#160; 531 1.17 92 Retail loans Residential mortgage 32 &#160; 1.74 &#160; 4 &#160; 24 1.36 4 Consumer 37 &#160; 1.61 &#160; 4 &#160; 33 1.56 4 Total retail loans 69 &#160; 1.67 &#160; 8 &#160; 57 1.47 8 Total loans 610 &#160; 1.14 &#160; % 100 &#160; % $ 588 1.19 % 100 % Allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments Business commitments 40 &#160; 24 &#160; Retail commitments 11 &#160; 6 &#160; Total commitments 51 &#160; 30 Allowance for credit losses $ 661 &#160; 1.24 &#160; % $ 618 1.26 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Allocated allowance as a percentage of related loans outstanding. \n\n(b) Loans outstanding as a percentage of total loans. \n\n(c) Includes PPP loans with a balance of $35 million and $459 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nFor additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" section of this financial review and Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nNonperforming Assets \n\nNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, TDRs which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed assets. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans, with nonperforming TDRs on either nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. In accordance with the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Corporation elected not to consider qualifying COVID-19-related modifications, primarily deferrals, as TDRs and did not designate such loans as past due or nonaccrual. The temporary relief \n\nF-18 \n\nprovided under the CARES Act applied to modifications made from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic through December 31, 2021. \n\nSummary of Nonperforming Assets and Past Due Loans \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) December 31 2022 2021 Nonaccrual loans $ 240 &#160; $ 264 Reduced-rate loans 4 &#160; 4 Total nonperforming loans 244 &#160; 268 Foreclosed property &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; Total nonperforming assets $ 244 &#160; $ 269 &#160; Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 0.45 &#160; % 0.54 % Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans 0.46 &#160; 0.54 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property 0.46 &#160; 0.55 Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing $ 23 &#160; $ 27 ##TABLE_END\n\nNonperforming assets decreased $25 million to $244 million at December 31, 2022, from $269 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in nonperforming assets primarily reflected a decrease of $45 million in nonaccrual business loans, partially offset by an increase of $21 million in nonaccrual retail loans, as temporary legislative relief for COVID-19-related deferrals ended on December 31, 2021. Nonperforming loans were 0.46 percent of total loans at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.54 percent at December 31, 2021. For further information regarding the composition of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of period $ 264 &#160; $ 347 Loans transferred to nonaccrual (a) 132 &#160; 193 Nonaccrual loan gross charge-offs (68) (70) Loans transferred to accrual status (a) (11) (25) Nonaccrual loans sold (15) (34) Payments/other (b) (62) (147) Balance at end of period $ 240 &#160; $ 264 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million. \n\n(b) Includes net changes related to nonaccrual loans with balances less than or equal to $2 million, payments on nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million and transfers of nonaccrual loans to foreclosed property. \n\nThere were 23 borrowers with a balance greater than $2 million, totaling $132 million, transferred to nonaccrual status in 2022, an increase of 5 borrowers compared to 18 borrowers totaling $193 million in 2021.

Loans past due 90 days or more decreased $4 million to $23 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $27 million at December 31, 2021. Loans past due 30-89 days increased $225 million to $378 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $153 million at December 31, 2021. Loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest as a percentage of total loans were 0.75 percent and 0.36 percent at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans with balances of $1 million or more whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) December 31 2022 2021 Total criticized loans $ 1,572 &#160; $ 1,573 As a percentage of total loans 2.9 &#160; % 3.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe $1 million decrease in criticized loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 included decreases of $90 million in Business Banking, $72 million in Corporate Banking, $60 million in Entertainment Lending and $46 million in Energy, mostly offset by increases of $121 million in Technology and Life Sciences, $99 million in general Middle Market and $53 million in Environmental Services. \n\nFor further information regarding the Corporation's nonperforming assets policies, refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk \n\nConcentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. The Corporation has concentrations of credit risk with the commercial real estate and automotive industries. All other industry concentrations, as defined by management, individually represented less than 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2022. \n\nF-20 \n\nCommercial Real Estate Lending \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 31 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (in millions) Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Commercial Real Estate business line (a) Other (b) Total Real estate construction loans $ 2,505 &#160; $ 600 &#160; $ 3,105 &#160; $ 2,391 &#160; $ 557 &#160; $ 2,948 Commercial mortgage loans 4,681 &#160; 8,625 &#160; 13,306 &#160; 3,338 &#160; 7,917 &#160; 11,255 Total commercial real estate $ 7,186 &#160; $ 9,225 &#160; $ 16,411 &#160; $ 5,729 $ 8,474 $ 14,203 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. \n\n(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. \n\nThe Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $16.4 billion at December 31, 2022. Of the total, $7.2 billion, or 44 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2021. Commercial real estate loans in other business lines totaled $9.2 billion, or 56 percent, at December 31, 2022, an increase of $751 million compared to December 31, 2021. These loans consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. Generally, loans previously reported as real estate construction are classified as commercial mortgage loans upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. \n\nThe real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. There were no criticized real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. In other business lines, criticized real estate construction loans totaled $3 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $35 million at December 31, 2021. There were no real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nCommercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $16 million and $29 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In other business lines, $151 million and $219 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in 2022, compared to net charge-offs of $2 million in 2021. \n\nAutomotive Lending - Dealer: \n\nThe following table presents a summary of dealer loans. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Dealer: Floor plan $ 1,379 &#160; $ 681 Other 3,988 &#160; 3,481 Total dealer $ 5,367 &#160; 10.1 &#160; % $ 4,162 8.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line and primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $698 million compared to $681 million at December 31, 2021, although an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive production continues to depress floor plan loan balances below pre-pandemic levels. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, other loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, including $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, respectively. \n\nThere were no nonaccrual dealer loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, there were no net charge-offs of dealer loans in either of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nF-21 \n\nAutomotive Lending- Production: \n\nThe following table presents a summary of loans to borrowers involved with automotive production. \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Loans Outstanding Percent of Total Loans Loans Outstanding (a) Percent of Total Loans (dollar amounts in millions) Production: Domestic $ 797 &#160; $ 789 Foreign 271 &#160; 323 Total production $ 1,068 &#160; 2.0 &#160; % $ 1,112 2.3 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Excludes PPP loans. \n\nLoans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, totaled $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. These borrowers have faced, and could face in the future, financial difficulties due to disruptions in auto production as well as their supply chains and logistics operations. As such, management continues to monitor this portfolio. \n\nThere were $5 million in nonaccrual loans to borrowers involved with automotive production at December 31, 2022, compared to none at December 31, 2021. Automotive production loan net charge-offs totaled $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $7 million for the same period in 2021. \n\nFor further information regarding significant group concentrations of credit risk, refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nResidential Real Estate Lending \n\nAt December 31, 2022, residential real estate loans represented 7 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollar amounts in millions) Residential Mortgage Loans Percent of Total Home Equity Loans Percent of Total Residential Mortgage Loans Percent of Total Home Equity Loans Percent of Total Geographic market: Michigan $ 497 &#160; 27 &#160; % $ 487 &#160; 27 &#160; % $ 434 24 % $ 484 32 % California 866 &#160; 48 &#160; 852 &#160; 48 &#160; 870 49 660 43 Texas 258 &#160; 14 &#160; 354 &#160; 20 &#160; 245 14 329 21 Other Markets 193 &#160; 11 &#160; 83 &#160; 5 &#160; 222 13 60 4 Total $ 1,814 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 1,776 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 1,771 100 % $ 1,533 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResidential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. \n\nResidential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $53 million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, of which 97 percent was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, 2 percent were in amortizing status and 1 percent were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $15 million were on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2022. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at December 31, 2022. \n\nEnergy Lending \n\nThe Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 120 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&#38;P), midstream and energy services. E&#38;P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&#38;P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated prices (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of \n\nF-22 \n\nhedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&#38;P segment. \n\nThe following table summarizes information about the Corporation's Energy business line. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 December 31 Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized (a) Outstandings Nonaccrual Criticized (a) Exploration and production (E&#38;P) $ 1,149 &#160; 81 &#160; % $ 7 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 971 80 % $ 14 $ 46 Midstream 253 &#160; 18 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 212 18 &#8212; &#8212; Services 13 &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5 &#160; 21 2 &#8212; 12 Total Energy business line $ 1,415 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 7 &#160; $ 12 &#160; $ 1,204 100 % $ 14 $ 58 As a percentage of total Energy loans 1 &#160; % 1 &#160; % 1 % 5 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes nonaccrual loans. \n\nLoans in the Energy business line totaled $1.4 billion, or 3 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2022, an increase of $211 million compared to December 31, 2021. Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $3.4 billion (a utilization rate of 43 percent) and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nNet credit-related Energy charge-offs were $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net recoveries of $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual Energy loans decreased by $7 million to $7 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $14 million at December 31, 2021. Criticized loans decreased $46 million to $12 million, or 1 percent of total criticized loans, at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. \n\nLeveraged Loans \n\nCertain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress-tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates. \n\nThe FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&#38;I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. \n\nThe following table summarizes information about HR C&#38;I loans, which represented 6 percent of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n(in millions) \n\nDecember 31 \n\n2022 2021 Outstandings $ 3,120 &#160; $ 2,927 Criticized \n\n393 &#160; 299 Net loan charge-offs recorded during the years ended December 31, 20 &#160; 18 ##TABLE_END\n\nF-23 \n\nMarket and Liquidity Risk \n\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times, or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times. \n\nThe Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. \n\nThe Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of scenarios, including both idiosyncratic and market-wide in nature, which vary in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of December 31, 2022 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events. \n\nIn addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations over a period of no less than 12 months. The Corporation had liquid assets of $1.8 billion on an unconsolidated basis at December 31, 2022. \n\nCorporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analyses of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks. \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floating-rate loans to fixed, the Corporation's loan composition at December 31, 2022 was 50 percent fixed-rate, 39 percent 30-day rate (primarily BSBY, LIBOR and SOFR), 6 percent 90-day and greater rate and 5 percent prime. The composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. Other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio. \n\nThe Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. \n\nSince no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. \n\nSensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates \n\nThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base-case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model \n\nF-24 \n\nassumptions. Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis. Model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at December 31, 2022 included for the rising rate scenario, a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances, and for the declining rate scenario, a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances. In addition, both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels, an incremental interest-bearing deposit beta of approximately 30%, no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps. \n\nThe average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was $19.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 with an average yield of 1.97% and effective duration of 5.3 years. \n\nThe table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Cash Flow Hedges (dollar amounts in millions) Notional Amount Weighted Average Yield Years to Maturity (a) \n\nSwaps under contract at December 31, 2022 (b) \n\n$ 26,600 2.45 % 4.6 Weighted average notional active per period: Full year 2022 12,092 2.16 4.0 First quarter 2023 22,145 2.34 4.4 Second quarter 2023 22,384 2.36 4.6 Third quarter 2023 22,018 2.38 4.7 Fourth quarter 2023 22,934 2.43 4.8 First quarter 2024 23,652 2.47 4.9 Second quarter 2024 23,532 2.49 5.0 Third quarter 2024 23,484 2.51 5.0 Fourth quarter 2024 23,633 2.54 5.1 Full year 2025 22,973 2.57 5.1 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Years to maturity calculated from a starting date of December 31, 2022. \n\n(b) Includes forward starting swaps of $2.6 billion starting in 2023 and $2.0 billion starting in 2024. Excluding forward starting swaps, the weighted average yield was 2.35%. \n\nThe analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert $3.2 billion of fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates through fair value hedges. Additionally, included in this analysis are $14.7 billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of 52 basis points at December 31, 2022. This base-case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which short-term rates rise or decline 100 basis points (with a floor of zero percent) in a linear, parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change of 50 basis points over the period. \n\nThe table below, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. \n\n##TABLE_START Estimated Annual Change (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 December 31 Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ 10 &#160; &#8212; &#160; % Rising 100 basis points $ 205 12 % (50 basis points on average) (50 basis points on average) Declining 100 basis points (72) (2) Declining to zero percent (46) (3) (50 basis points on average) ##TABLE_END\n\nOverall sensitivity to interest rate movements declined from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 resulting from an increase in fixed-rate loans (including the impact of interest rate swaps) from 22 percent of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 to 50 percent at December 31, 2022, as well as from a decrease in non-maturity deposits. The impact on a dollar basis to declining interest rates increased primarily due to an increase in the federal funds rate, allowing for a full 100 basis point repricing of the balance sheet in the 2022 scenario, compared to 25 basis points in the 2021 scenario, as well as an increase in modeled base case net interest income. Sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to increased cash flow hedges and non-maturity deposit runoff but was partially offset by the increased repricing potential of floating-rate loans as they moved above their contractual floor rates. \n\nF-25 \n\nSensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates \n\nIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base-case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 100 basis point shock with a floor of zero percent. \n\nThe table below, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 December 31 Amount % Amount % Change in Interest Rates: Change in Interest Rates: Rising 100 basis points $ (417) (3 &#160; %) Rising 100 basis points $ 1,353 9 % Declining 100 basis points 627 &#160; 4 &#160; Declining to zero percent (446) (3) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates changed from an increase as of December 31, 2021 to a reduction as of December 31, 2022 due to additional receive-fixed cash flow swaps, growth of fixed-rate securities and deposit runoff. Sensitivity to declining rates now increases economic value of equity due to the same factors. \n\nLoans by Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity \n\nThe contractual maturity distribution of the loan portfolio is presented below. \n\n##TABLE_START Loans Maturing \n\n(in millions) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nWithin One Year (a) After One But Within Five Years After Five But Within Fifteen Years After Fifteen Years Total Commercial loans $ 12,047 &#160; $ 17,357 &#160; $1,377 $ 128 &#160; $ 30,909 &#160; Real estate construction loans 745 &#160; 2,133 &#160; 221 6 &#160; 3,105 &#160; Commercial mortgage loans 2,346 &#160; 7,287 &#160; 3,646 27 &#160; 13,306 &#160; Lease financing 233 &#160; 491 &#160; 36 &#8212; &#160; 760 &#160; International loans 557 &#160; 578 &#160; 62 &#8212; &#160; 1,197 &#160; Residential mortgage loans 4 &#160; 6 &#160; 224 1,580 &#160; 1,814 &#160; Consumer loans 505 &#160; 175 &#160; 125 1,506 &#160; 2,311 &#160; Total $ 16,437 &#160; $ 28,027 &#160; $ 5,691 &#160; $ 3,247 &#160; $ 53,402 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes demand loans, loans having no stated repayment schedule or maturity and overdrafts. \n\nThe interest rate composition of loans with a maturity date over one year are presented below based on contractual terms. \n\n##TABLE_START Loans Maturing After One Year \n\n(in millions) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nPredetermined (Fixed) Interest Rate Floating Interest Rate Total Commercial loans $ 485 &#160; $ 18,377 &#160; $ 18,862 &#160; Real estate construction loans 23 &#160; 2,337 &#160; 2,360 &#160; Commercial mortgage loans 1,376 &#160; 9,584 &#160; 10,960 &#160; Lease financing 329 &#160; 198 &#160; 527 &#160; International loans 37 &#160; 603 &#160; 640 &#160; Residential mortgage loans 400 &#160; 1,366 &#160; 1,766 &#160; Consumer loans 32 &#160; 1,774 &#160; 1,806 &#160; Total $ 2,682 &#160; $ 34,239 &#160; $ 36,921 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRisk Management Derivative Instruments \n\nThe Corporation uses investment securities and derivative instruments as asset and liability management tools with the overall objective of managing the volatility of net interest income from changes in interest rates.

Risk management interest rate swaps generated no net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $163 million of net interest income generated for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nIn addition to interest rate swaps, the Corporation employs various other types of derivative instruments as offsetting positions to mitigate exposures to foreign currency risks associated with specific assets and liabilities (e.g., customer loans or deposits denominated in foreign currencies). Such instruments may include foreign exchange spot and forward contracts as well as foreign exchange swap agreements. \n\nFurther information regarding risk management derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nCustomer-Initiated and Other Derivative Instruments \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n(in millions) \n\nCustomer-Initiated and Other Notional Activity \n\nInterest Rate Contracts Energy Derivative Contracts Foreign Exchange Contracts Totals Balance at January 1, 2021 $ 21,521 $ 3,121 $ 1,901 $ 26,543 Additions 5,370 7,992 42,173 55,535 Maturities/amortizations (2,713) (2,790) (42,358) (47,861) Terminations (3,178) (553) &#8212; (3,731) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 21,000 $ 7,770 $ 1,716 $ 30,486 Additions 7,593 &#160; 14,145 &#160; 42,017 &#160; 63,755 &#160; Maturities/amortizations (3,017) (6,002) (41,029) (50,048) Terminations (5,278) (1,392) &#8212; &#160; (6,670) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 20,298 &#160; $ 14,521 &#160; $ 2,704 &#160; $ 37,523 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Corporation sells and purchases interest rate caps and floors and enters into foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and energy derivative contracts to accommodate the needs of customers requesting such services.

Customer-initiated and other notional activity represented 55 percent and 73 percent of total interest rate, energy and foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFurther information regarding customer-initiated and other derivative instruments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nLIBOR Transition \n\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Effective March 2021, the FCA confirmed that certain LIBOR tenors will no longer be supported after December 31, 2021 and that the remaining tenors, including those most commonly used by the Corporation, will cease to be supported after June 30, 2023. The Corporation has substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans and derivatives, and is preparing for a transition from LIBOR toward alternative rates. \n\nThe Corporation ceased originating LIBOR-based products in the fourth quarter of 2021 and has since reduced total LIBOR exposure by approximately 50 percent to $31.5 billion. Substantially all of the Corporation&#8217;s LIBOR exposure is \n\nF-27 \n\ncomprised of loans, swaps and options. Of the remaining LIBOR-based products, 82 percent required no further remediation because the instruments mature prior to cessation or include fallback language. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $16.0 billion of LIBOR-based loans, compared to $40.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Of these, approximately 18 percent have maturity dates prior to cessation, 46 percent mature after cessation but have fallback language and the remaining 36 percent are in process of remediation. The Corporation is confident it will complete its remediation efforts in a timely manner. \n\nIn addition to remediation activity on LIBOR-based loans, the Corporation has enacted the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols which relates to $15.5 billion of derivatives. Once events occur that trigger a fallback, the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from LIBOR to the ISDA Fallback Rate, which is the daily SOFR plus a spread. \n\nThe Corporation's enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee for both best practices and recommended objectives. The Corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of LIBOR as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates. For a discussion of the various risks facing the Corporation in relation to the transition away from LIBOR, see the market risk discussion within &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nSources of Liquidity \n\nThe Corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. The majority of the Corporation's balance sheet is funded by customer deposits. Cash flows from loan repayments, increases in deposit accounts, activity in the securities portfolio and the purchased funds market serve as the Corporation's primary liquidity sources. \n\nThe Corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. The Corporation had access to liquid assets of $20.0 billion and $35.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which included cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and the portion of the investment securities portfolio that the Corporation can sell without third-party consent. \n\nIn addition, the Corporation may access external funding sources when necessary, which include FHLB advances, federal funds, reverse repurchase agreements, brokered deposits and Corporation-issued bonds. The Corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities. \n\nPurchased funds increased to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $50 million at December 31, 2021, reflecting an increase in short-term FHLB advances. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $24.5 billion which provided for up to $19.6 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The Bank is also a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, $9.5 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for $3.2 billion in short-term advances and providing an additional $7.2 billion for potential future borrowings. \n\nThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital, earnings and other relevant factors related to the Corporation and the Bank. As of December 31, 2022, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. \n\n##TABLE_START Comerica Incorporated Comerica Bank December 31, 2022 Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard and Poor&#8217;s BBB+ Stable A- Stable Moody&#8217;s Investors Service A3 Stable A3 Stable Fitch Ratings A- Stable A- Stable ##TABLE_END\n\nPotential Uses of Liquidity \n\nVarious financial obligations such as contractual obligations, unfunded commitments and deposit withdrawals may require future cash payments by the Corporation. Certain obligations are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while others are off-balance sheet under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nF-28 \n\nThe following table summarizes the Corporation's material noncancelable contractual obligations and future required minimum payments. Refer to Notes 10, 11, 12, and 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these contractual obligations. \n\nSelected Contractual Obligations \n\n##TABLE_START Minimum Payments Due by Period \n\n(in millions) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nTotal Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years Deposits without a stated maturity (a) $ 69,460 &#160; $ 69,460 &#160; Certificates of deposit and other deposits with a stated maturity (a) \n\n1,937 &#160; 1,789 &#160; $ 112 &#160; $ 31 &#160; $ 5 &#160; Short-term borrowings (a) 3,211 &#160; 3,211 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Medium- and long-term debt (a) 3,150 &#160; 850 &#160; 850 &#160; 400 &#160; 1,050 &#160; Operating leases 480 &#160; 63 &#160; 132 &#160; 100 &#160; 185 &#160; Total contractual obligations $ 78,238 &#160; $ 75,373 &#160; $ 1,094 &#160; $ 531 &#160; $ 1,240 &#160; Medium- and long-term debt (parent company only) (a) (b) $ 1,650 &#160; $ 850 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 250 &#160; $ 550 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Deposits and borrowings exclude accrued interest. \n\n(b) Parent company only amounts are included in the medium- and long-term debt minimum payments above. \n\nIn addition to contractual obligations, other commercial commitments of the Corporation impact liquidity. These include unused commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial commitments and expected expiration dates by period. \n\nCommercial Commitments \n\n##TABLE_START Expected Expiration Dates by Period \n\n(in millions) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nTotal Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years Unused commitments to extend credit $ 34,817 &#160; $ 6,295 &#160; $ 14,030 &#160; $ 10,713 &#160; $ 3,779 &#160; Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees 3,712 &#160; 3,347 &#160; 73 &#160; 230 &#160; 62 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 39 &#160; 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total commercial commitments $ 38,568 &#160; $ 9,681 &#160; $ 14,103 &#160; $ 10,943 &#160; $ 3,841 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSince many of these commitments expire without being fully drawn, and each customer must continue to meet the conditions established in the contract, the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the Corporation. Refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these commercial commitments. \n\nOther Market Risks \n\nMarket risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity. \n\nOperational Risk \n\nOperational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people, or from external events, excluding in most cases those driven by technology (see Technology Risk below). The Corporation's definition of operational risk includes fraud; employment practice and workplace safety; clients, products and business practice; business continuity or disaster recovery; execution, delivery, and process management; third party and model risks. The definition does not include strategic or reputational risks. Although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred in business operations, the Corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management, as outlined in the Corporation&#8217;s risk appetite statement. The appropriate risk level is determined through consideration of the nature of the Corporation's business and the environment in which it operates, in combination with the impact from, and the possible impact on, other risks faced by the Corporation. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels. The Operational Risk Management Committee monitors risk management techniques and systems. The Corporation has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk reporting function in the Enterprise Risk Division and business/support unit risk liaisons responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines. \n\nF-29 \n\nTechnology Risk \n\nTechnology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people, processes, applications and infrastructure that support the technology environment. The Corporation's definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk, technology investment risk, cybersecurity risk, information security risk and information management risk. Technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes and activities by third-party contractors and suppliers to the Corporation. Other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event, such as the risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory non-compliance, and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk. \n\nThe Technology Risk Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for technology, cybersecurity, information security and enterprise risk management, oversees technology risk. The Technology Risk Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level. \n\nCompliance Risk \n\nCompliance risk represents the risk of sanctions or financial loss resulting from the Corporation's failure to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and standards of good banking practice. The impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk, as the reputational impact from compliance breaches can be severe. Activities which may expose the Corporation to compliance risk include, but are not limited to, those dealing with the prevention of money laundering, privacy and data protection, community reinvestment initiatives, fair lending, consumer protection, employment and tax matters, over-the-counter derivative activities and other regulated activities. \n\nThe Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee, comprising senior and executive business unit managers, as well as managers responsible for compliance, audit and overall risk, oversees compliance risk. This enterprise-wide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization. The Enterprise-Wide Compliance Committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level. \n\nStrategic Risk \n\nStrategic risk represents the risk of inadequate returns or possible losses due to impairment of reputation, failure to fully develop and execute business plans, failure to assess current and new opportunities in business, markets and products, failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted, and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit, market and liquidity, operational, technology or compliance risks. Mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through numerous metrics and initiatives to help the Corporation better understand, measure and report on such risks. The Executive Strategy and Pricing Committee, comprised of senior managers, oversees strategic risk and ensures that strategic risk is mitigated to appr opriate levels. \n\nF-30 \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2022, the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below. \n\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n\nIn accordance with CECL, the allowance for credit losses, which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio. The Corporation uses loss factors, based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default, to determine the allowance for credit losses for the majority of its portfolio. Management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lending-related commitments with similar risk characteristics, calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the 2022 model, refer to the &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; section of this financial review. \n\nManagement's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments, current as well as forecasted economic factors and other relevant information. The calculation is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate, the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process, development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments. Sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses. Sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results. They do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework. \n\nLoan Risk Rating Process \n\nReserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics, including the Corporation's internal risk rating system; therefore, loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan. The inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning and/or entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the Corporation's asset quality review function. Changes to internal risk ratings, beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models, would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, if 5 percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools, the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2022 would change by approximately $3 million. \n\nForecasted Economic Variables \n\nManagement selects models through which historical reserve factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools. Loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period. Management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions, the Corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios, including a more severe economic forecast scenario, with varying responses to current economic risks. The following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful. \n\nF-31 \n\n##TABLE_START Economic Variable More Severe Forecast Real GDP growth Contracts through first quarter 2024, peaking at a decline of 6.6 percent annualized in second quarter 2023, subsequently improving to a 2 percent annual growth rate by the end of the forecast period. Unemployment rate Increases to almost 9 percent by fourth quarter 2024. \n\nCorporate BBB bond to 10-year Treasury bond spreads Spreads widen to a peak of over 5.5 percent before gradually narrowing to 2.5 percent by the end of the forecast period. \n\nOil Prices Decline to $39 per barrel by mid-2024 before improving to $46 per barrel by fourth quarter 2024. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSelecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate, absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process, if the Corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its models, the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 would increase by approximately $308 million. However, factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario. \n\nQualitative Adjustments and Model Overlays \n\nThe Corporation includes qualitative adjustments, as appropriate, intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate, including foresight risk, model imprecisions and input imprecisions. Qualitative adjustments for foresight risk reflect the inherent imprecision in economic forecasts and may be included based on management&#8217;s evaluation of different forecast scenarios, ranging from more benign to more severe, and known recent events impacting the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio. Model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative models. Input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired, as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. Qualitative reserves at December 31, 2022 primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables. \n\nOther Considerations \n\nTo the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. The allowance is assigned to business segments, and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the Commercial Bank segment. \n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT \n\nInvestment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans that have been measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting. \n\nFair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value hierarchy, the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 represented close to 100 percent and 99 percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, respectively. Valuations generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3 and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities are considered critical accounting estimates. \n\nF-32 \n\nPENSION PLAN ACCOUNTING \n\nThe Corporation has a qualified and a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Effective January 1, 2017, benefits are calculated using a cash balance formula based on years of service, age, compensation and an interest credit based on the 30-year Treasury rate. Participants under age 60 as of December 31, 2016 are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula. Participants age 60 or older as of December 31, 2016 continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit. The Corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation, the long-term rate of return expected on plan assets, mix of assets within the portfolio and the projected mortality rate. \n\nThe discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date, December 31. The long-term rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets are primarily invested in certain collective investment funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, as well as corporate and municipal bonds and notes. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries, considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources. \n\nThe Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations. The major assumptions used to calculate 2023 and 2022 defined benefit plan pension expense (benefit) were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 &#160; 2022 &#160; Discount rate 5.60 % 2.96 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.50 % 6.50 % Mortality table: Base table (a) Pri-2012 Pri-2012 Mortality improvement scale (a) MP-2020 MP-2020 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Issued by the Society of Actuaries \n\nDefined benefit plan benefit is expected to decrease $64 million to approximately $25 million in 2023, compared to a benefit of $89 million in 2022. This includes service cost expense of $34 million and a benefit from other components of $59 million. Service costs are included in salaries and benefits expense, while the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s pension plan is most sensitive to changes in discount rate and long-term rate of return. A change to the discount rate implies a corresponding change in interest rates that affect the value of the plan&#8217;s fixed income assets. An increase of 25 basis points to the discount rate, including the effect of higher interest rates on the plan&#8217;s fixed income assets, would result in a net increase to pension expense of $11 million, while a decrease of 25 basis points would reduce pension expense by $11 million. Increasing the long-term rate of return by 25 basis points would reduce pension expense by $6 million, while a decrease of 25 basis points would increase pension expense by $6 million. \n\nDue to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. \n\nINCOME TAXES \n\nThe provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions, currently or in the future, and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nIncluded in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, assumptions made regarding future events and, when applicable, state loss carryback capacity. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. \n\nF-33 \n\nThe Corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments. This assessment is complex and requires judgment. The Corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question and/or challenge the tax positions taken by the Corporation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law, interpretations of existing tax laws, new judicial or regulatory guidance, and the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the Corporation. These changes, when they occur, impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the Corporation. For further information on tax accruals and related risks, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA \n\nThe Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. \n\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) is a measure that the Corporation uses to understand fundamental operating performance before credit-related and tax expenses. \n\nTangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk. \n\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio removes preferred stock from the Tier 1 capital ratio as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes that the presentation of tangible common equity adjusted for the impact of accumulated other comprehensive loss provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability with prior periods. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and regulatory ratios used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP. \n\nF-34 \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) December 31 2022 2021 Pre-tax, Pre-provision Net Revenue (PPNR): Net income $ 1,151 &#160; $ 1,168 Add: Provision for income taxes 325 &#160; 322 Provision for credit losses 60 &#160; (384) PPNR $ 1,536 &#160; $ 1,106 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital: Tier 1 capital $ 8,278 &#160; $ 7,458 &#160; Less: Fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock 394 &#160; 394 &#160; Common equity tier 1 capital $ 7,884 &#160; $ 7,064 Risk-weighted assets $ 78,871 &#160; $ 69,708 &#160; Tier 1 capital ratio 10.50 &#160; % 10.70 &#160; % Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 10.00 &#160; 10.13 &#160; Tangible Common Equity Ratio: Total shareholders' equity $ 5,181 &#160; $ 7,897 Less: Fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock 394 &#160; 394 Common shareholders' equity $ 4,787 &#160; $ 7,503 Less: Goodwill 635 &#160; 635 Other intangible assets 9 &#160; 11 Tangible common equity $ 4,143 &#160; $ 6,857 Total assets $ 85,406 &#160; $ 94,616 Less: Goodwill 635 &#160; 635 Other intangible assets 9 &#160; 11 Tangible assets $ 84,762 &#160; $ 93,970 Common equity ratio 5.60 &#160; % 7.93 % Tangible common equity ratio 4.89 &#160; 7.30 Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock: Common shareholders' equity $ 4,787 &#160; $ 7,503 Tangible common equity 4,143 &#160; 6,857 Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions) 131 &#160; 131 Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock $ 36.55 &#160; $ 57.41 Tangible common equity per share of common stock 31.62 &#160; 52.46 Impact of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Tangible Common Equity: Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) (3,742) (212) Tangible common equity, excluding AOCI 7,885 &#160; 7,069 Tangible common equity ratio, excluding AOCI 9.30 &#160; % 7.52 % Tangible common equity per share of common stock, excluding AOCI $ 60.19 &#160; 54.08 ##TABLE_END\n\nF-35 \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis report includes forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

\n\n&#8226; declines in the businesses or industries of the Corporation's customers could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect the Corporation; \n\n&#8226; governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry, and therefore impact the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect the Corporation's net interest income and balance sheet; \n\n&#8226; developments impacting LIBOR and other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect the Corporation; \n\n&#8226; the Corporation must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations, support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities; \n\n&#8226; reduction in the Corporation's credit ratings could adversely affect the Corporation and/or the holders of its securities; \n\n&#8226; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation; \n\n&#8226; security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting the Corporation&#8217;s colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft, could result in the disclosure of confidential information; \n\n&#8226; cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus; \n\n&#8226; t he Corporation&#8217;s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached; \n\n&#8226; the Corporation relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its delivery systems, and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations; \n\n&#8226; legal and regulatory proceedings and related financial services industry matters, including those directly involving the Corporation and its subsidiaries, could adversely affect the Corporation or the financial services industry in general; \n\n&#8226; the Corporation may incur losses due to fraud; \n\n&#8226; controls and procedures may fail to prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; \n\n&#8226; changes in regulation or oversight, or changes in Comerica&#8217;s status with respect to existing regulations or oversight, may have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's operations; \n\n&#8226; compliance with more stringent capital requirements may adversely affect the Corporation; \n\n&#8226; the impacts of future legislative, administrative or judicial changes or interpretations to tax regulations are unknown; \n\n&#8226; damage to the Corporation&#8217;s reputation could damage its businesses; \n\n&#8226; the Corporation may not be able to utilize technology to develop, market and deliver new products and services to its customers; \n\n&#8226; competitive product and pricing pressures within the Corporation's markets may change; \n\n&#8226; the introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Corporation's business; \n\n&#8226; management's ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations; \n\n&#8226; management's ability to retain key officers and employees may change; \n\nF-36 \n\n&#8226; any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to the Corporation's business and operations; \n\n&#8226; general political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected; \n\n&#8226; inflation could negatively impact the Corporation's business, profitability and stock price; \n\n&#8226; methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective; \n\n&#8226; catastrophic events, including pandemics, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Corporation; \n\n&#8226; climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect the Corporation's operations, businesses and customers; \n\n&#8226; changes in accounting standards could materially impact the Corporation's financial statements; \n\n&#8226; the Corporation's accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain;

The Corporation&#8217;s major business segments are the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. For further discussion of each business segment, refer to Note 22. The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries are regulated at both the state and federal levels. \n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain amounts in the financial statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation. \n\nThe following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Corporation applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and the accounts of those subsidiaries that are majority owned and in which the Corporation has a controlling financial interest. The Corporation consolidates entities not determined to be variable interest entities (VIEs) when it holds a controlling financial interest and applies the cost or equity method when it holds less than a controlling financial interest. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The results of operations of companies acquired are included from the date of acquisition. \n\nThe Corporation holds investments in certain legal entities that are considered VIEs. In general, a VIE is an entity that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. If any of these characteristics are present, the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation model, and consolidation is based on variable interests, not on voting interests. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other economic interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity&#8217;s net asset value. The primary beneficiary, which is required to consolidate the VIE, is defined as the party that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. The maximum potential exposure to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally limited to the sum of the outstanding book basis and unfunded commitments for future investments. \n\nThe Corporation evaluates its investments in VIEs, both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires reconsideration, to determine if the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required. The Corporation accounts for unconsolidated VIEs using either the proportional, cost or equity method. These investments comprise investments in community development projects which generate tax credits to their investors and are included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nThe proportional method is used for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). The equity method is used for other investments where the Corporation has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity&#8217;s operation and financial policies. Other unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method. Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the provision for income taxes, while income, amortization and write-downs from cost and equity method investments are recorded in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nAssets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Corporation and are not included in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nSee Note 9 for additional information about the Corporation&#8217;s involvement with VIEs. \n\nF-43 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Corporation uses present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used. \n\nFair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. \n\nInvestment securities available-for-sale, derivatives, deferred compensation plans and equity securities with readily determinable fair values (primarily money market mutual funds) are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Corporation may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting. \n\nFair value measurements and disclosures guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. Fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, it is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. \n\n##TABLE_START Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are less active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Corporation generally utilizes third-party pricing services to value Level 1 and Level 2 securities. Management reviews the methodologies and assumptions used by the third-party pricing services and evaluates the values provided, principally by comparison with other available market quotes for similar instruments and/or analysis based on internal models using available third-party market data. The Corporation may occasionally adjust certain values provided by the third-party pricing service when management believes, as the result of its review, that the adjusted price most appropriately reflects the fair value of the particular security. \n\nFair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates, often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique so that changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values. \n\nFollowing are descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis. The descriptions include an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified. \n\nCash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks \n\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1. \n\nF-44 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nDeferred compensation plan assets and liabilities as well as equity securities with a readily determinable fair value \n\nThe Corporation holds a portfolio of securities that includes equity securities and assets held related to deferred compensation plans. Securities and associated deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and included in other short-term investments and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Level 1 securities include assets related to deferred compensation plans, which are invested in mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and other securities traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 2 securities include municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and corporate debt securities. Deferred compensation plan liabilities represent the fair value of the obligation to the plan participant, which corresponds to the fair value of the invested assets. The methods used to value equity securities and deferred compensation plan assets are the same as the methods used to value investment securities, discussed below. \n\nInvestment securities \n\nInvestment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored entities, as well as corporate debt securities. The fair value of Level 2 securities is determined using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates, spreads and prepayment information. \n\nSecurities classified as Level 3 represent securities in less liquid markets requiring significant management assumptions when determining fair value. \n\nLoans held-for-sale \n\nLoans held-for-sale, included in other short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held-for-sale may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. The fair value is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Corporation classifies both loans held-for-sale subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments and the estimated fair value of loans held-for sale as Level 2. \n\nLoans \n\nThe Corporation does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, an individual allowance may be established for a loan that no longer shares risk characteristics with loan pools, typically collateral-dependent loans for which reserves are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Such loan values are reported as nonrecurring fair value measurements. Collateral values supporting individually evaluated loans are evaluated quarterly. When management determines that the fair value of the collateral requires additional adjustments, either as a result of non-current appraisal value or when there is no observable market price, the Corporation classifies the loan as Level 3. \n\nThe Corporation discloses fair value estimates for loans. The estimated fair value is determined based on characteristics such as loan category, repricing features and remaining maturity, and includes prepayment and credit loss estimates. Fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model that employs discount rates reflecting current pricing for loans with similar maturity and risk characteristics, including credit characteristics, and the cost of equity for the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of loans held for investment as Level 3. \n\nCustomers&#8217; liability on acceptances outstanding and acceptances outstanding \n\nCustomers' liability on acceptances outstanding is included in accrued income and other assets and acceptances outstanding are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1. \n\nDerivative assets and derivative liabilities \n\nDerivative instruments held or issued for risk management or customer-initiated activities are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. Fair value for over-the-counter derivative instruments is measured on a recurring basis using internally developed models primarily based on market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities. The Corporation manages credit risk on its derivative positions based on whether the derivatives \n\nF-45 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nare settled through a clearinghouse or bilaterally with each counterparty. For derivative positions settled on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis, the Corporation calculates credit valuation adjustments, included in the fair value of these instruments, on the basis of its relationships at the counterparty portfolio or master netting agreement level. These credit valuation adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative after considering collateral and other master netting arrangements. These adjustments, which are considered Level 3 inputs, are based on estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. When credit valuation adjustments are significant to the overall fair value of a derivative, the Corporation classifies the over-the-counter derivative valuation in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy; otherwise, over-the-counter derivative valuations are classified in Level 2. \n\nNonmarketable equity securities \n\nThe Corporation has a portfolio of indirect (through funds) private equity and venture capital investments, included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investments are accounted for either on the cost or equity method and are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. These investments may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be impaired and written down to fair value. Where there is not a readily determinable fair value, the Corporation estimates fair value for indirect private equity and venture capital investments based on the net asset value, as reported by the fund. \n\nThe Corporation also holds restricted equity investments, primarily Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock. Restricted equity securities are not readily marketable and are recorded at cost (par value) in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. No significant observable market data for these instruments is available. The Corporation considers the profitability and asset quality of the issuer, dividend payment history and recent redemption experience and believes its investments in FRB and FHLB stock are ultimately recoverable at par. Therefore, the carrying amount for these restricted equity investments approximates fair value. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of such investments as Level 1. The Corporation&#8217;s investment in FHLB stock totaled $ 138 million and $ 7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and its investment in FRB stock totaled $ 85 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nOther real estate \n\nOther real estate is included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and includes primarily foreclosed property. Foreclosed property is initially recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, at the date of legal title transfer to the Corporation, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequently, foreclosed property is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. Other real estate may be carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised value or management's estimate of the value of the property. When management determines that the fair value of other real estate requires additional adjustments, either as a result of a non-current appraisal or when there is no observable market price, the Corporation classifies the other real estate as Level 3. \n\nDeposit liabilities \n\nThe estimated fair value of checking, savings and certain money market deposit accounts is represented by the amounts payable on demand. The estimated fair value of term deposits is calculated by discounting the scheduled cash flows using the period-end rates offered on these instruments. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of deposit liabilities as Level 2. \n\nShort-term borrowings \n\nThe carrying amount of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings approximates the estimated fair value. As such, the Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of short-term borrowings as Level 1. \n\nMedium- and long-term debt \n\nThe estimated fair value of the Corporation's medium- and long-term debt is based on quoted market values when available. If quoted market values are not available, the estimated fair value is based on the market values of debt with similar characteristics. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of medium- and long-term debt as Level 2. \n\nF-46 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nCredit-related financial instruments \n\nCredit-related financial instruments include unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments generate ongoing fees which are recognized over the term of the commitment. The carrying value of the deferred fees, which approximates fair value of these instruments, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Corporation classifies the estimated fair value of credit-related financial instruments as Level 3. \n\nFor further information about fair value measurements refer to Note 2. \n\nOther Short-Term Investments \n\nOther short-term investments include deferred compensation plan assets, certificates of deposits, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and loans held-for-sale. \n\nDeferred compensation plan assets and equity securities are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nLoans held-for-sale, typically residential mortgages originated with the intent to sell and occasionally including other loans transferred to held-for-sale, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined in the aggregate for each portfolio. Changes in fair value and gains or losses upon sale are included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nInvestment Securities \n\nDebt securities are classified as trading, available-for-sale (AFS) or held-to-maturity. Trading securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. AFS securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (OCI). Securities for which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Interest income is recognized using the interest method. All of the Corporation's investment securities are classified as AFS at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nAn AFS security is impaired if its fair value is less than amortized cost. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance to investment securities available-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-credit-related impairment is recognized as a component of OCI. If the Corporation intends to sell an impaired AFS security or more likely than not will be required to sell that security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount is recognized in earnings with corresponding adjustment to the security's amortized cost basis. \n\nFor certain types of AFS securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and other securities with government guarantees, the Corporation generally expects zero credit losses. The zero-loss expectation applies to all the Corporation&#8217;s securities and no allowance for credit losses was recorded on its AFS securities portfolio at December 31, 2022. \n\nGains or losses on the sale of securities are computed based on the adjusted cost of the specific security sold. \n\nFor further information on investment securities, refer to Note 3. \n\nLoans \n\nLoans and leases originated and held for investment are recorded at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned income, charge-offs and unamortized deferred fees and costs. Interest income is recognized on loans and leases using the interest method. \n\nThe Corporation assesses all loan modifications to determine whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). A restructuring is considered a TDR when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Corporation grants a concession to the borrower. TDRs on accrual status at the original contractual rate of interest are considered performing. Nonperforming TDRs include TDRs on nonaccrual status and loans which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans). \n\nCertain types of modifications related to COVID-19 that were granted during 2020 and 2021 were excluded from TDR accounting. See Note 1 in the 2021 10-K for additional information. \n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-04 \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate \n\nF-47 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nReform on Financial Reporting,\" (ASU 2020-04). Typically, entities must evaluate whether a loan contract modification results in a modified loan or a new loan for accounting purposes. Topic 848 allows entities to bypass this evaluation for qualifying modifications related to reference rate reform. The Corporation will apply the relief provided by Topic 848 to qualifying contract modifications. The FASB included a sunset provision within Topic 848 of December 31, 2022, based on the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announcement that it would no longer need to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after December 31, 2021. In March 2021, the FCA extended the intended cessation date of most tenors of LIBOR in the United States to June 30, 2023. In response, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,&#8221; (ASU 2022-06) in December 2022, which defers the expiration date of ASC Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. The Corporation adopted ASU 2022-06 immediately upon issuance. \n\nLoan Origination Fees and Costs \n\nSubstantially all loan origination fees and costs are deferred and amortized to net interest income over the life of the related loan or over the commitment period as a yield adjustment. Net deferred income on originated loans, including unearned income and unamortized costs, fees, premiums and discounts, totaled $ 118 million and $ 102 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nLoan fees on unused commitments and net origination fees related to loans sold are recognized in noninterest income. \n\n&#160; Allowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. \n\nThe Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans include the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of residential mortgage and consumer loans, including home equity loans. \n\nCurrent expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual life of the loan portfolio, considering all available relevant information, including historical and current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events. \n\nAllowance for Loan Losses \n\nThe allowance for loan losses is estimated on a quarterly basis and represents management&#8217;s estimates of current expected credit losses in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually. \n\nCollective loss estimates are determined by applying loss factors, designed to estimate current expected credit losses, to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio. Loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools. Business loans are assigned to pools based primarily on business line and the Corporation&#8217;s internal risk rating system. For retail loans, pools are based on loan type, past due status and credit scores. Loss factors are based on estimated probability of default for each pool, set to a default horizon based on contractual life, and loss given default. Historical estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with each of the probability of default and loss given default pools. At least annually, management considers different models when estimating credit losses, selecting ones that most reasonably forecast credit losses in the relevant economic environment. \n\nThe calculation of current expected credit losses is inherently subjective, as it requires management to exercise judgment in determining appropriate factors used to determine the allowance. Some of the most significant factors in the quantitative allowance estimate are assigning internal risk ratings to loans, selecting the economic forecasts used to calibrate the reserve factors and determining the reasonable and supportable forecast period. \n\n&#8226; Internal Risk Ratings : Loss factors are dependent on loan risk ratings for business loans. Risk ratings are assigned at origination, based on inherent credit risk, and updated based on new information that becomes available, periodic reviews of credit quality, a change in borrower performance or modifications to lending agreements. \n\n&#8226; Economic Forecasts: Management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base, including forecasted levels of employment, gross domestic product, corporate bond and treasury spreads, industrial production levels, consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing \n\nF-48 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nstatistics. Different economic forecast scenarios ranging from more benign to more severe are evaluated each reporting period to forecast losses over the contractual life of the loan portfolio. \n\n&#8226; Forecast Period : Economic forecasts are applied over the period management believes it can estimate reasonable and supportable forecasts. Forecast periods may be adjusted in response to changes in the economic environment. To estimate losses for contractual periods that extend beyond the forecast horizon, the Corporation reverts to an average historical loss experience. The Corporation typically forecasts economic variables over a two-year horizon, followed by an immediate reversion to an average historical loss experience that generally incorporates a full economic cycle. Management reviews this methodology on at least an annual basis. \n\nThe allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for, including adjustments for foresight risk, input imprecision and model imprecision. Foresight risk reflects the inherent imprecision in forecasting economic variables, including determining the depth and duration of economic cycles and their impact to relevant economic variables. The Corporation may make qualitative adjustments based on its evaluation of different forecast scenarios and known recent events impacting relevant economic variables. Input imprecision factors address the risk that certain model inputs may not reflect all available information including (i) risk factors that have not been fully addressed in internal risk ratings, (ii) changes in lending policies and procedures, (iii) changes in the level and quality of experience held by lending management, (iv) imprecision in the risk rating system and (v) limitations in data available for certain loan portfolios. Model imprecision considers known model limitations and model updates not yet fully reflected in the quantitative estimate. \n\nThe determination of the appropriate qualitative adjustment is based on management's analysis of current and expected economic conditions and their impact to the portfolio, as well as internal credit risk movements and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards. Management recognizes the sensitivity of various assumptions made in the quantitative modeling of expected losses and may adjust reserves depending upon the level of uncertainty that currently exists in one or more assumptions. \n\nCredit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis. Individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as TDRs and are based on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows. The Corporation considers certain loans to be collateral-dependent if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and management expects repayment for the loan to be substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. For collateral-dependent loans, loss estimates are based on the fair value of collateral, less estimated cost to sell (if applicable). Collateral values supporting individually evaluated loans are assessed quarterly and appraisals are typically obtained at least annually. \n\nThe total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the portfolio. Unanticipated events impacting the economy, including political instability or global events affecting the U.S. economy, could cause changes to expectations for current conditions and economic forecasts that result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Significant increases in current portfolio exposures or changes in credit characteristics could also increase the amount of the allowance. Such events, or others of similar nature, may result in the need for additional provision for credit losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. \n\nLoans deemed uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. \n\nCredit losses are not estimated for accrued interest receivable as interest that is deemed uncollectible is written off through interest income. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors, determined in a manner similar to business loans, multiplied by a probability of draw estimate, based on historical experience and credit risk, applied to commitment amounts. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the corresponding charge included in the provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. \n\nNonperforming Assets \n\nNonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, reduced-rate loans and foreclosed property. \n\nF-49 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nA loan is considered past due when the contractually required principal or interest payment is not received by the specified due date or, for certain loans, when a scheduled monthly payment is past due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. The past-due status of a business loan is one of many indicative factors considered in determining the collectibility of the credit. The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged-off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status once they become 90 days past due and are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. In addition, junior lien home equity loans less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if they have underlying risk characteristics that place full collection of the loan in doubt, such as when the related senior lien position is identified as seriously delinquent. Residential mortgage and consumer loans in bankruptcy for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to estimated collateral value, without regard to the actual payment status of the loan, and are classified as TDRs. All other consumer loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, or earlier if deemed uncollectible. \n\nAt the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Principal and interest payments received on such loans are generally first applied as a reduction of principal. Income on nonaccrual loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received after principal has been fully repaid or future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or when the loan or debt security is both well secured and in the process of collection. \n\nForeclosed property (primarily real estate) is initially recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, at the date of legal title transfer to the Corporation and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Loans are reclassified to foreclosed property upon obtaining legal title to the collateral. Independent appraisals are obtained to substantiate the fair value of foreclosed property at the time of foreclosure and updated at least annually or upon evidence of deterioration in the property&#8217;s value. At the time of foreclosure, the adjustment for the difference between the related loan balance and fair value (less estimated costs to sell) of the property acquired is charged or credited to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent write-downs, operating expenses and losses upon sale, if any, are charged to noninterest expenses. Foreclosed property is included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nPremises and Equipment \n\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation, computed using the straight-line method, is charged to occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are generally 3 years to 33 years for premises that the Corporation owns and 3 years to 8 years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are generally amortized over the terms of their respective leases or 10 years, whichever is shorter. \n\nOperating Leases \n\nOperating leases with a term greater than one year are recognized as lease liabilities, measured as the present value of unpaid lease payments for operating leases where the Corporation is the lessee, and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets for the right to use the leased properties. Operating lease liabilities, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities, reflect the Corporation&#8217;s obligation to make future lease payments, primarily for real estate locations. Lease terms typically comprise contractual terms but may include extension options reasonably certain of being exercised at lease inception for certain strategic locations such as regional headquarters. Payments are discounted using the Corporation's incremental borrowing rate, or the rate it would pay to borrow amounts equal to the lease payments over the lease term. The Corporation does not separate lease and non-lease components for contracts in which it is the lessee. ROU assets, recorded in accrued income and other assets, are measured based on lease liabilities adjusted for incentives as well as accrued and prepaid rent. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are recognized as incurred. Common area maintenance and other executory costs are the main components of variable lease payments. Operating and variable lease expenses are recorded in net occupancy expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nSoftware \n\nCapitalized software, stated at cost less accumulated amortization, includes purchased software and capitalizable application development costs associated with internally developed software and cloud computing arrangements, including capitalizable implementation costs associated with hosting arrangements that are service contracts. Cloud computing \n\nF-50 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\narrangements include software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and other similar hosting arrangements. The Corporation primarily utilizes SaaS and IaaS arrangements. Capitalized implementation costs of hosting arrangements that are service contracts were $ 32 million at December 31, 2022, which included accumulated depreciation related to these costs of $ 3 million. Capitalized implementation costs of hosting arrangements that are service contracts were $ 21 million at December 31, 2021, which included accumulated depreciation related to these costs of $ 3 million. \n\nCapitalized software is included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense, generally computed on the straight-line method, is charged to software expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the estimated useful life of the software, generally five years, or the term of the hosting arrangement for implementation costs related to service contracts. \n\nGoodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles \n\nGoodwill, included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. \n\nThe Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary. Additionally, the Corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. Factors considered in the assessment of the likelihood of impairment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, stock performance of the Corporation and its peers, financial performance of the reporting units, and previous results of goodwill impairment tests, amongst other factors. Based on the results of the qualitative analysis, the Corporation determines whether a quantitative test is necessary. The quantitative test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \n\nCore deposit intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis, based on the estimated period the economic benefits are expected to be received. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment for a finite-lived intangible asset exists if its carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. \n\nAdditional information regarding goodwill and core deposit intangibles can be found in Note 7. \n\nNonmarketable Equity Securities \n\nThe Corporation has certain investments that are not readily marketable. These investments include a portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds and restricted equity investments, which are securities the Corporation is required to hold for various reasons, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock. These investments are accounted for on the cost or equity method and are included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Indirect private equity and venture capital funds are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Impairment is charged to current earnings and the carrying value of the investment is written down accordingly. FHLB and FRB stock are recorded at cost (par value) and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. If the Corporation does not expect to recover the full par value, the amount by which the par value exceeds the ultimately recoverable value would be charged to current earnings and the carrying value of the investment would be written down accordingly. \n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities \n\nDerivative instruments are carried at fair value in either accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument is determined by whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, by the type of hedging relationship. The Corporation presents derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis when a right of offset exists, based on transactions with a single counterparty and any cash collateral paid to and/or received from that counterparty for derivative contracts that are subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements. \n\nF-51 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nFor derivative instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in the same consolidated statement of income line that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item during the period of the change in fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same consolidated statement of income line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change. \n\nTo qualify for the use of hedge accounting, a derivative must be effective at inception and expected to be continuously effective in offsetting the risk being hedged. For derivatives designated as hedging instruments at inception, the Corporation uses either the short-cut method or applies statistical regression analysis to assess effectiveness. The short-cut method is used for $ 2.6 billion of notional of fair value hedges of medium- and long-term debt. This method allows for the assumption of perfect effectiveness and eliminates the requirement to further assess hedge effectiveness on these transactions. For hedge relationships to which the Corporation does not apply the short-cut method, statistical regression analysis is used at inception to assess whether the derivative used is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. A statistical regression or qualitative analysis is performed at each reporting period thereafter to evaluate hedge effectiveness. \n\nTopic 848 provided optional provisions to minimize the impact of reference rate reform to qualifying fair value and cash flow hedging relationships by allowing certain hedge accounting requirements to be suspended during the transition period. The Corporation has elected various provisions to transition its hedging relationships away from LIBOR. For further information on Topic 848, refer to the \"Loans\" policy in this Note. \n\nFurther information on the Corporation&#8217;s derivative instruments and hedging activities is included in Note 8. \n\nShort-Term Borrowings \n\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized borrowings and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash received. The contractual terms of the agreements to repurchase may require the Corporation to provide additional collateral if the fair value of the securities underlying the borrowings declines during the term of the agreement. \n\nFinancial Guarantees \n\nCertain guarantee contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the Corporation, as guarantor, to make payments to the guaranteed party are initially measured at fair value and included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The subsequent accounting for the liability depends on the nature of the underlying guarantee. The release from risk is accounted for under a particular guarantee when the guarantee expires or is settled, or by a systematic and rational amortization method. \n\nFurther information on the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under guarantees is included in Note 8. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nThe Corporation recognizes share-based compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for all stock awards, including those with graded vesting. The requisite service period is the period an employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award, which cannot extend beyond the date at which the employee is no longer required to perform any service to receive the share-based compensation (i.e., the retirement-eligible date). Forfeiture of stock awards and dividend equivalents are accounted for as they occur. \n\nCertain awards are contingent upon performance and/or market conditions, which affect the number of shares ultimately issued. The Corporation periodically evaluates the probable outcome of the performance conditions and makes cumulative adjustments to compensation expense as appropriate. Market conditions are included in the determination of the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Subsequent to the grant date, market conditions have no impact on the amount of compensation expense the Corporation will recognize over the life of the award. \n\nFurther information on the Corporation&#8217;s share-based compensation plans is included in Note 16. \n\nF-52 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRevenue from contracts with customers comprises the noninterest income earned by the Corporation in exchange for services provided to customers and is recognized when services are completed or as they are rendered, although contracts are generally short-term by nature. Services provided over a period of time are typically transferred to customers evenly over the term of the contracts and revenue is recognized accordingly over the period services are provided. Contract receivables are included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payment terms vary by services offered, and the time between completion of performance obligations and payment is typically not significant. \n\nCard Fees \n\nCard fees comprise interchange and other fee income earned on government card, commercial card, debit/automated teller machine card and merchant payment processing programs. Card fees are presented net of network costs, as performance obligations for card services are limited to transaction processing and settlement with the card network on behalf of the customers. Fees for these services are primarily based on interchange rates set by the network and transaction volume. The Corporation also provides ongoing card program support services, for which fees are based on contractually agreed-upon prices and customer demand for services. \n\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts \n\nService charges on deposit accounts comprise charges on retail and business accounts, including fees for treasury management services. Treasury management services include transaction-based services related to payment processing, overdrafts, non-sufficient funds and other deposit account activity, as well as account management services that are provided over time. Business customers can earn credits depending on deposit balances maintained with the Corporation, which may be used to offset fees. Fees and credits are based on predetermined, agreed-upon rates. \n\nFiduciary Income \n\nFiduciary income includes fees and commissions from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and other services provided primarily to personal and institutional trust customers. Revenue is recognized as the services are performed and is based either on the market value of the assets managed or the services provided, as well as agreed-upon rates. \n\nCommercial Lending Fees \n\nCommercial lending fees include both revenue from contracts with customers (primarily loan servicing fees) and other sources of revenue. Commercial loan servicing fees are based on contractually agreed-upon prices and when the services are provided. Other sources of revenue in commercial lending fees primarily include fees assessed on the unused portion of commercial lines of credit (unused commitment fees) and syndication arrangements. \n\nBrokerage Fees \n\nBrokerage fees are commissions earned for facilitating securities transactions for customers, as well as other brokerage services provided. Revenue is recognized when services are completed and is based on the type of services provided and agreed-upon rates. The Corporation pays commissions based on brokerage fee revenue. These are typically recognized when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less and are included in salaries and benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nOther Revenues \n\nOther revenues, consisting primarily of other retail fees, investment banking fees and insurance commissions, are typically recognized when services or transactions are completed and are based on the type of services provided and agreed-upon rates. \n\nExcept as discussed above, commissions and other incentives paid to employees are generally based on several internal and external metrics and, as a result, are not solely dependent on revenue generating activities. \n\nF-53 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Costs \n\nDefined benefit pension costs are funded consistent with the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Inherent in the determination of defined benefit pension costs are assumptions concerning future events that will affect the amount and timing of required benefit payments under the plans. These include demographic assumptions such as retirement age and mortality, a compensation rate increase, a discount rate used to determine the current benefit obligation, form of payment election and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. Net periodic defined benefit pension expense includes service cost, interest cost based on the assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value of assets (MRVA), amortization of prior service cost or credit and amortization of net actuarial gains or losses. The MRVA for fixed income securities and private placement assets is based on the fair value of plan assets, whereas the MRVA for other plan assets is determined by amortizing the current year&#8217;s investment gains and losses (the actual investment return net of the expected investment return) over 5 years. The amortization adjustment cannot exceed 10 percent of the fair value of assets. Prior service costs or credits include the impact of plan amendments on the liabilities and are amortized over the future service periods of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Actuarial gains and losses result from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value). Amortization of actuarial gains and losses is included as a component of net periodic defined benefit pension cost for a year if the actuarial net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Service costs are included in salaries and benefits expense, while the other components of net periodic defined benefit pension expense are included in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nPostretirement benefit costs includes service cost, interest cost based on the assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived MRVA, amortization of prior service cost or credit and amortization of net actuarial gains or losses. The components of postretirement benefit costs follow similar policies and methodologies as defined benefit pensions costs. Postretirement benefits are recognized in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nSee Note 17 for further information regarding the Corporation&#8217;s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. The Corporation classifies interest and penalties on income tax liabilities and excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from employee stock awards in the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nDeferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, foreign tax credit limitations, assumptions made regarding future events and, when applicable, state loss carryback capacity. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. \n\nEarnings Per Share \n\nBasic net income per common share is calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each share of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (distributed earnings) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Distributed and undistributed earnings are allocated between common and participating security shareholders based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities (e.g., certain service-based restricted stock units). Undistributed net losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted shareholders, as these shareholders do not have a contractual obligation to fund the losses incurred by the Corporation. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. \n\nDiluted net income per common share is calculated using the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. The dilutive calculation considers common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, as well as service- and performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Corporation&#8217;s stock plans using the treasury stock method, if dilutive. Net income attributable to common shares is then divided by the total of weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. \n\nF-54 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nStatements of Cash Flows \n\nCash and cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nComprehensive (Loss) Income \n\nThe Corporation presents on an annual basis the components of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate, but consecutive statements and presents on an interim basis the components of net income and a total for comprehensive income in one continuous consolidated statement of comprehensive income. \n\nPending Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures\" (ASU 2022-02), which eliminates the accounting for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) while expanding modification and vintage disclosure requirements. The update requires additional disclosures on the nature, magnitude and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. ASU 2022-02 further included a requirement to disclose gross charge-offs incurred by year of origination of the related loan or lease. The standard update is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2023, and must be applied prospectively, except that the recognition and measurement of TDRs may be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation adopted ASU 2022-02 prospectively on January 1, 2023 and will update its disclosures in the first quarter of 2023. The update is not expected to have a material impact to the Corporation's financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. \n\nNOTE 2 &#8211; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nNote 1 contains information about the fair value hierarchy, descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis. \n\nF-55 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nThe following tables present the recorded amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2022 Deferred compensation plan assets $ 92 &#160;

The unobservable inputs were the additional adjustments applied by management to the appraised values to reflect such factors as non-current appraisals and revisions to estimated time to sell. These adjustments are determined based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis and are not observable inputs, although they are used in the determination of fair value. \n\nF-57 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nEstimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis \n\nThe Corporation typically holds the majority of its financial instruments until maturity and thus does not expect to realize many of the estimated fair value amounts disclosed. The disclosures also do not include estimated fair value amounts for items that are not defined as financial instruments, but which have significant value. These include such items as the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of trust operations and other fee generating businesses. The Corporation believes the imprecision of an estimate could be significant. \n\nThe carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis on the Corporation&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2022 Assets Cash and due from banks $ 1,758 &#160; $ 1,758 &#160; $ 1,758 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Interest-bearing deposits with banks 4,524 &#160; 4,524 &#160; 4,524 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other short-term investments 19 &#160; 19 &#160; 19 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Loans held-for-sale 2 &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total loans, net of allowance for loan losses (a) 52,792 &#160; 50,964 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 50,964 &#160; Customers&#8217; liability on acceptances outstanding 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted equity investments 223 &#160; 223 &#160; 223 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Nonmarketable equity securities (b) 5 &#160; 12 &#160; Liabilities Demand deposits (noninterest-bearing) 39,945 &#160; 39,945 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 39,945 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Interest-bearing deposits 29,566 &#160; 29,566 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 29,566 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Customer certificates of deposit 1,762 &#160; 1,719 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,719 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other time deposits 124 &#160; 124 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 124 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total deposits 71,397 &#160; 71,354 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 71,354 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Short-term borrowings 3,211 &#160; 3,211 &#160; 3,211 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Acceptances outstanding 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Medium- and long-term debt 3,024 &#160; 3,071 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,071 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Credit-related financial instruments ( 79 ) ( 79 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 79 ) December 31, 2021 Assets Cash and due from banks $ 1,236 &#160; $ 1,236 &#160; $ 1,236 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Interest-bearing deposits with banks 21,443 &#160; 21,443 &#160; 21,443 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other short-term investments 16 &#160; 16 &#160; 16 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Loans held-for-sale 6 &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total loans, net of allowance for loan losses (a) 48,697 &#160; 49,127 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 49,127 &#160; Customers&#8217; liability on acceptances outstanding 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Restricted equity investments 92 &#160; 92 &#160; 92 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Nonmarketable equity securities (b) 5 &#160; 10 &#160; Liabilities Demand deposits (noninterest-bearing) 45,800 &#160; 45,800 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 45,800 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Interest-bearing deposits 34,566 &#160; 34,566 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 34,566 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Customer certificates of deposit 1,973 &#160; 1,968 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,968 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total deposits 82,339 &#160; 82,334 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 82,334 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Acceptances outstanding 5 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Medium- and long-term debt 2,796 &#160; 2,854 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,854 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Credit-related financial instruments ( 59 ) ( 59 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 59 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Included $66 million and $150 million of loans recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n(b) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The Corporation&#8217;s portfolio is comprised of securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. As such, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investments. Further, the Corporation does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the the investments before recovery of amortized costs. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation had 1,289 securities in an unrealized loss position with no allowance for credit losses, comprised of 27 U.S. Treasury securities, 1,008 residential mortgage-backed securities and 254 commercial mortgage-backed securities. \n\nF-59 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nInterest receivable on investment securities totaled $ 49 million and $ 36 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and was included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nSales, calls and write-downs of investment securities available-for-sale, computed based on the adjusted cost of the specific security, resulted in no gains or losses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, a $ 1 million gain was offset by a $ 1 million loss, recorded in noninterest income. \n\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair values of investment securities by contractual maturity. Securities with multiple maturity dates are classified in the period of final maturity. The actual cash flows of mortgage-backed securities may differ as borrowers of the underlying loans may exercise prepayment options. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31, 2022 Amortized Cost Fair Value Contractual maturity Within one year $ 1,103 &#160; $ 1,093 &#160; After one year through five years 1,943 &#160; 1,797 &#160; After five years through ten years 5,518 &#160; 4,946 &#160; After ten years 13,481 &#160; 11,176 &#160; Total investment securities $ 22,045 &#160; $ 19,012 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, investment securities with a carrying value of $ 3.2 billion were pledged where permitted or required by law, including $ 1.0 billion pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) as collateral for potential future borrowings and $ 2.2 billion to secure $ 1.0 billion of liabilities, primarily public and other deposits of state and local government agencies as well as derivative instruments.

Special mention loans have potential credit weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s close attention, such as loans to borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties that may result in deterioration of repayment prospects from the borrower at some future date. Accruing substandard loans have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, such as loans to borrowers who may be experiencing losses from operations or inadequate liquidity of a degree and duration that jeopardizes the orderly repayment of the loan. Substandard loans are also distinguished by the distinct possibility of loss in the future if these weaknesses are not corrected. Nonaccrual loans are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued. For further information regarding nonaccrual loans, refer to the Nonperforming Assets subheading in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies. These categories are generally consistent with the \"special mention\" and \"substandard\" categories as defined by regulatory authorities. A minority of nonaccrual loans are consistent with the \"doubtful\" category. \n\nLoan interest receivable totaled $ 261 million and $ 120 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nF-63 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe following table details the changes in the allowance for credit losses. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) Business Loans Retail Loans Total Business Loans Retail Loans Total Business Loans Retail Loans Total Years Ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period: Allowance for loan losses $ 531 &#160; $ 57 &#160; $ 588 &#160; $ 895 &#160; $ 53 &#160; $ 948 &#160; $ 601 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 637 &#160; Allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 24 &#160; 6 &#160; 30 &#160; 35 &#160; 9 &#160; 44 &#160; 28 &#160; 3 &#160; 31 &#160; Allowance for credit losses 555 &#160; 63 &#160; 618 &#160; 930 &#160; 62 &#160; 992 &#160; 629 &#160; 39 &#160; 668 &#160; Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 42 ) 25 &#160; ( 17 ) Loan charge-offs ( 65 ) ( 3 ) ( 68 ) ( 67 ) ( 3 ) ( 70 ) ( 233 ) ( 5 ) ( 238 ) Recoveries on loans previously charged-off 47 &#160; 4 &#160; 51 &#160; 76 &#160; 4 &#160; 80 &#160; 38 &#160; 4 &#160; 42 &#160; Net loan (charge-offs) recoveries ( 18 ) 1 &#160; ( 17 ) 9 &#160; 1 &#160; 10 &#160; ( 195 ) ( 1 ) ( 196 ) Provision for credit losses: Provision for loan losses 28 &#160; 11 &#160; 39 &#160; ( 373 ) 3 &#160; ( 370 ) 531 &#160; ( 7 ) 524 &#160; Provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments 16 &#160; 5 &#160; 21 &#160; ( 11 ) ( 3 ) ( 14 ) 7 &#160; 6 &#160; 13 &#160; Provision for credit losses 44 &#160; 16 &#160; 60 &#160; ( 384 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 384 ) 538 &#160; ( 1 ) 537 &#160; Balance at end of period: Allowance for loan losses 541 &#160; 69 &#160; 610 &#160; 531 &#160; 57 &#160; 588 &#160; 895 &#160; 53 &#160; 948 &#160; Allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 40 &#160; 11 &#160; 51 &#160; 24 &#160; 6 &#160; 30 &#160; 35 &#160; 9 &#160; 44 &#160; Allowance for credit losses $ 581 &#160; $ 80 &#160; $ 661 &#160; $ 555 &#160; $ 63 &#160; $ 618 &#160; $ 930 &#160; $ 62 &#160; $ 992 &#160; Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 1.10 &#160; % 1.67 &#160; % 1.14 &#160; % 1.17 &#160; % 1.47 &#160; % 1.19 &#160; % 1.85 &#160; % 1.32 &#160; % 1.81 &#160; % Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans 1.18 &#160; 1.96 &#160; 1.24 &#160; 1.22 &#160; 1.63 &#160; 1.26 &#160; 1.93 &#160; 1.55 &#160; 1.90 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-64 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nNonaccrual Loans \n\nThe following table presents additional information regarding nonaccrual loans.

Also includes commercial loans restructured in bankruptcy. \n\n(c) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. \n\n(d) Includes bankruptcy loans for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt. \n\nThe Corporation charges interest on principal balances outstanding during deferral periods. Additionally, none of the modifications involved forgiveness of principal. There were no significant commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in TDRs at December 31, 2022 and 2021. On an ongoing basis, the Corporation monitors the performance of modified loans to their restructured terms. The allowance for loan losses continues to be reassessed on the basis of an individual evaluation of the loan. \n\nFor principal deferrals, incremental deterioration in the credit quality of the loan, represented by a downgrade in the risk rating of the loan, for example, due to missed interest payments or a reduction of collateral value, is considered a subsequent default. For interest rate reductions, a subsequent payment default is defined in terms of delinquency, when a principal or interest payment is 90 days past due. Of the TDRs modified during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $ 6 million of subsequent defaults of principal deferrals and no interest rate reductions for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to no principal deferrals or interest rate reductions for the comparable period in 2021. \n\nNOTE 5 - SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK \n\nConcentrations of credit risk may exist when a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities, or activities in the same geographic region, and have similar economic characteristics that would cause them to be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. Concentrations of both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit risk are controlled and monitored as part of credit policies. The Corporation is a regional financial services holding company with a geographic concentration of its on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activities in Michigan, California and Texas. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Corporation's concentration of credit risk with the commercial real estate industry, which includes a portfolio of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, represented 31 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. \n\nF-66 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) &#160; &#160; December 31 2022 2021 Real estate construction loans: Commercial Real Estate business line (a) $ 2,505 &#160; $ 2,391 &#160; Other business lines (b) 600 &#160; 557 &#160; Total real estate construction loans 3,105 &#160; 2,948 &#160; Commercial mortgage loans: Commercial Real Estate business line (a) 4,681 &#160; 3,338 &#160; Other business lines (b) 8,625 &#160; 7,917 &#160; Total commercial mortgage loans 13,306 &#160; 11,255 &#160; Total commercial real estate loans $ 16,411 &#160; $ 14,203 &#160; Total unused commitments on commercial real estate loans $ 6,602 &#160; $ 4,030 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Primarily loans to real estate developers. \n\n(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. \n\nThe Corporation also has a concentration of credit risk with the automotive industry, which represented 12 percent of total loans at December 31, 2022.

In addition, the Corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. \n\nIn 2022 and 2021, the annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter, and in both periods, a qualitative assessment resulted in the Corporation determining goodwill was not impaired, as it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. \n\nThe Corporation recorded amortization expense related to the core deposit intangible of $ 1 million for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The core deposit intangible was fully amortized at December 31, 2021. \n\nNOTE 8 - DERIVATIVE AND CREDIT-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into various transactions involving derivative and credit-related financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rate, foreign currency and other market risks and to meet the financing needs of customers (customer-initiated derivatives). These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. Market and credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. \n\nMarket risk is the potential loss that may result from movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or energy commodity prices that cause an unfavorable change in the value of a financial instrument. The Corporation manages this risk by establishing monetary exposure limits and monitoring compliance with those limits. Market risk inherent in interest rate and energy contracts entered into on behalf of customers is mitigated by taking offsetting positions, except in those circumstances when the amount, tenor and/or contract rate level results in negligible economic risk, whereby the cost of purchasing an offsetting contract is not economically justifiable. The Corporation mitigates most of the inherent market risk in foreign exchange contracts entered into on behalf of customers by taking offsetting positions and manages the remainder through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and positions are monitored quarterly. Market risk inherent in derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes is typically offset by changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. \n\nCredit risk is the possible loss that may occur in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to a financial instrument. The Corporation attempts to minimize credit risk arising from customer-initiated derivatives by evaluating the creditworthiness of each customer, adhering to the same credit approval process used for traditional lending activities and obtaining collateral as deemed necessary. Derivatives with dealer counterparties are either cleared through a clearinghouse or settled directly with a single counterparty. For derivatives settled directly with dealer counterparties, the Corporation utilizes counterparty risk limits and monitoring procedures as well as master netting arrangements and bilateral collateral agreements to facilitate the management of credit risk. \n\nIncluded in the fair value of derivative instruments are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk. These adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative. Master netting arrangements effectively reduce credit valuation adjustments by permitting settlement of positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. Bilateral collateral agreements require daily exchange of cash or highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government entities to collateralize amounts due to either party. At December 31, 2022, counterparties with bilateral collateral agreements deposited $ 185 million of cash with the Corporation to secure the fair value of contracts in an unrealized gain position, and the Corporation had pledged $ 202 million of marketable investment securities and posted $ 4 million of cash as collateral for contracts in an unrealized loss position. For those counterparties not covered under bilateral collateral agreements, collateral is obtained, if deemed necessary, based on the results of management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral varies, but may include cash, investment securities, accounts receivable, equipment or real estate. \n\nF-68 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\nDerivative instruments utilized by the Corporation are negotiated over-the-counter and primarily include swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts and options, each of which may relate to interest rates, energy commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. Swaps are agreements in which two parties periodically exchange cash payments based on specified indices applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Caps and floors are agreements which entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based on the difference between a specified reference rate or price and an agreed strike rate or price, applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Forward contracts are over-the-counter agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Options are similar to forward contracts except the purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the asset during a specified period or at a specified future date. \n\nOver-the-counter contracts are tailored to meet the needs of the counterparties involved and, therefore, contain a greater degree of credit risk and liquidity risk than exchange-traded contracts, which have standardized terms and readily available price information. The Corporation reduces exposure to market and liquidity risks from over-the-counter derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes, and transactions entered into to mitigate the market risk associated with customer-initiated transactions, by taking offsetting positions with investment grade domestic and foreign financial institutions and subjecting counterparties to credit approvals, limits and collateral monitoring procedures similar to those used in making other extensions of credit. In addition, certain derivative contracts executed bilaterally with a dealer counterparty in the over-the-counter market are cleared through a clearinghouse, whereby the clearinghouse becomes the counterparty to the transaction. \n\nThe following table presents the composition of the Corporation&#8217;s derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes or in connection with customer-initiated and other activities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The table excludes a derivative related to the Corporation's 2008 sale of its remaining ownership of Visa shares and includes accrued interest receivable and payable. \n\nF-69 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 &#160; &#160; Fair Value &#160; Fair Value (in millions) Notional/ Contract Amount (a) Gross Derivative Assets Gross Derivative Liabilities Notional/ Contract Amount (a) Gross Derivative Assets Gross Derivative Liabilities Risk management purposes Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Interest rate contracts: Fair value swaps - receive fixed/pay floating $ 3,150 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 2,650 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Cash flow swaps - receive fixed/ \n\npay floating (b) \n\n26,600 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 50 &#160; 8,050 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivatives used as economic hedges Foreign exchange contracts: Spot, forwards and swaps 392 &#160; 1 &#160; 3 &#160; 452 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Total risk management purposes 30,142 &#160; 1 &#160; 53 &#160; 11,152 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; Customer-initiated and other activities Interest rate contracts: Caps and floors written 924 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; 809 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3 &#160; Caps and floors purchased 924 &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 809 &#160; 3 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Swaps 18,450 &#160; 181 &#160; 569 &#160; 19,382 &#160; 236 &#160; 66 &#160; Total interest rate contracts 20,298 &#160; 206 &#160; 594 &#160; 21,000 &#160; 239 &#160; 69 &#160; Energy contracts: Caps and floors written 4,051 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 430 &#160; 1,779 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 203 &#160; Caps and floors purchased 4,051 &#160; 431 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,779 &#160; 204 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Swaps 6,419 &#160; 589 &#160; 576 &#160; 4,212 &#160; 466 &#160; 459 &#160; Total energy contracts 14,521 &#160; 1,020 &#160; 1,006 &#160; 7,770 &#160; 670 &#160; 662 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts: Spot, forwards, options and swaps 2,704 &#160; 52 &#160; 42 &#160; 1,716 &#160; 19 &#160; 14 &#160; Total customer-initiated and other activities 37,523 &#160; 1,278 &#160; 1,642 &#160; 30,486 &#160; 928 &#160; 745 &#160; Total gross derivatives $ 67,665 &#160; 1,279 &#160; 1,695 &#160; $ 41,638 &#160; 928 &#160; 747 &#160; Amounts offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: Netting adjustment - Offsetting derivative assets/liabilities ( 644 ) ( 644 ) ( 187 ) ( 187 ) Netting adjustment - Cash collateral received/posted ( 180 ) ( 4 ) ( 15 ) ( 452 ) Net derivatives included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (c) 455 &#160; 1,047 &#160; 726 &#160; 108 &#160; Amounts not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: Marketable securities pledged under bilateral collateral agreements ( 70 ) ( 202 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 52 ) Net derivatives after deducting amounts not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets $ 385 &#160; $ 845 &#160; $ 726 &#160; $ 56 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Notional or contractual amounts, which represent the extent of involvement in the derivatives market, are used to determine the contractual cash flows required in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Included in the fair value of net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk and credit risk of the Corporation. The fair value of net derivative assets included credit valuation adjustments for counterparty credit risk of $2 million and $9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nF-70 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nRisk Management \n\nThe Corporation's derivative instruments used for managing interest rate risk include cash flow hedging strategies that convert variable-rate loans to fixed rates and fair value hedging strategies that convert fixed-rate medium-and long-term debt to variable rates. Interest and fees on loans included $( 25 ) million, $ 95 million and $ 70 million of cash flow hedge (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe following table details the effects of fair value hedging on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Interest on Medium- and Long-Term Debt Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Total interest on medium-and long-term debt (a) $ 87 &#160; $ 35 &#160; $ 80 &#160; Fair value hedging relationships: Interest rate contracts: Hedged items 112 &#160; 102 &#160; 109 &#160; Derivatives designated as hedging instruments ( 25 ) ( 68 ) ( 51 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes the effects of hedging. \n\nCentrally-cleared derivative positions are settled daily based on derivative fair values and the party receiving net settlement amounts pays price alignment, based on an earning rate, to the party making settlement payments. Accordingly, the Corporation may recognize risk management hedging income consisting of price alignment income or expense depending on the fair value of its positions. Price alignment income was reported in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 8 million for the year ending December 31, 2022 and was insignificant for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n\nFor information on accumulated net (losses) gains on cash flow hedges, refer to Note 14. \n\nThe following tables summarize the expected weighted average remaining maturity of the notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps, the weighted average interest rates associated with amounts expected to be received or paid on interest rate swap agreements, and for fair value swaps, the carrying amount of the related hedged items, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nCash flow swaps - receive fixed/pay floating rate on variable-rate loans \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted average: Time to maturity (in years) 4.6 &#160; 2.4 Receive rate (a) 2.35 &#160; % 1.84 &#160; % Pay rate (a), (b) 4.07 &#160; 0.10 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Excludes forward starting swaps not effective as of the period shown.

Derivative contracts with maturity dates beyond the LIBOR cessation date will fall back to the daily SOFR with a spread adjustment. \n\nF-71 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nCustomer-Initiated and Other \n\nThe Corporation enters into derivative transactions at the request of customers and generally takes offsetting positions with dealer counterparties to mitigate the inherent market risk. Income primarily results from the spread between the customer derivative and the offsetting dealer position. \n\nFor customer-initiated foreign exchange contracts where offsetting positions have not been taken, the Corporation manages the remaining inherent market risk through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. For those customer-initiated derivative contracts which were not offset or where the Corporation holds a position within the limits described above, the Corporation recognized no net gains and losses in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nFair values of customer-initiated and other derivative instruments represent the net unrealized gains or losses on such contracts and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gains recognized in income on customer-initiated derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting positions included in derivative income, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest rate contracts $ 34 &#160; $ 36 &#160; $ 26 &#160; Energy contracts 28 &#160; 18 &#160; 1 &#160; Foreign exchange contracts 47 &#160; 45 &#160; 40 &#160; Total $ 109 &#160; $ 99 &#160; $ 67 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nCredit-Related Financial Instruments \n\nThe Corporation issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with commercial and consumer lending activities. The Corporation&#8217;s credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31 2022 2021 Unused commitments to extend credit: Commercial and other $ 30,800 &#160; $ 25,910 &#160; Bankcard, revolving credit and home equity loan commitments 4,017 &#160; 3,554 &#160; Total unused commitments to extend credit $ 34,817 &#160; $ 29,464 &#160; Standby letters of credit $ 3,712 &#160; $ 3,378 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 39 &#160; 44 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance to cover current expected credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $ 51 million and $ 30 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nUnused Commitments to Extend Credit \n\nCommitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total contractual amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Corporation. Commercial and other unused commitments are primarily variable rate commitments. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments included $ 44 million and $ 27 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation&#8217;s unused commitments to extend credit. \n\nStandby and Commercial Letters of Credit \n\nStandby letters of credit represent conditional obligations of the Corporation which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance foreign or domestic trade transactions. These contracts expire in decreasing amounts through the year 2029 . The Corporation may enter \n\nF-72 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\ninto participation arrangements with third parties that effectively reduce the maximum amount of future payments which may be required under standby and commercial letters of credit. These risk participations covered $ 107 million and $ 98 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of the $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.4 billion of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe carrying value of the Corporation&#8217;s standby and commercial letters of credit, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $ 35 million at December 31, 2022, including $ 28 million in deferred fees and $ 7 million in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. At December 31, 2021, the comparable amounts were $ 32 million, $ 29 million and $ 3 million, respectively. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of criticized standby and commercial letters of credit at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting, periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using Board committee approved credit policies and guidelines. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Total criticized standby and commercial letters of credit $ 37 &#160; $ 37 &#160; As a percentage of total outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit 1.0 &#160; % 1.1 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nOther Credit-Related Financial Instruments \n\nThe Corporation enters into credit risk participation agreements, under which the Corporation assumes credit exposure associated with a borrower&#8217;s performance related to certain interest rate derivative contracts. The Corporation is not a party to the interest rate derivative contracts and only enters into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Corporation is also a party to the related loan participation agreement for such borrowers. The Corporation manages its credit risk on the credit risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the normal credit review process as if the Corporation had entered into the derivative instruments directly with the borrower. The notional amount of such credit risk participation agreements reflects the pro-rata share of the derivative instrument, consistent with its share of the related participated loan. The total notional amount of the credit risk participation agreements was approximately $ 951 million and $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the fair value was insignificant at December 31, 2022 and $ 1 million at December 31, 2021. The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments, assuming 100 percent default by all obligors on the maximum values, was insignificant at December 31, 2022 and $ 30 million at December 31, 2021. In the event of default, the lead bank has the ability to liquidate the assets of the borrower, in which case the lead bank would be required to return a percentage of the recouped assets to the participating banks. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining maturity of outstanding credit risk participation agreements was 3.8 years. \n\nIn 2008, the Corporation sold its remaining ownership of Visa Class B shares and entered into a derivative contract. Under the terms of the derivative contract, the Corporation will compensate the counterparty primarily for dilutive adjustments made to the conversion factor of the Visa Class B shares to Class A shares based on the ultimate outcome of litigation involving Visa. Conversely, the Corporation will be compensated by the counterparty for any increase in the conversion factor from anti- dilutive adjustments. The notional amount of the derivative contract was equivalent to approximately 780,000 Visa Class B Shares. The fair value of the derivative liability, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $ 12 million and $ 13 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nNOTE 9 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIEs) \n\nThe Corporation evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. \n\nThe Corporation holds ownership interests in funds in the form of limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs) investing in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). The Corporation also directly invests in limited partnerships and LLCs which invest in community development projects, which generate similar tax credits to investors (other tax credit entities). As an investor, the Corporation obtains income tax credits and deductions from the operating losses of these tax credit entities. These tax credit entities meet the definition of a VIE; however, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the entities, as the general partner or the managing member has both the power to \n\nF-73 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities. \n\nThe Corporation accounts for its interests in LIHTC entities using the proportional amortization method. Ownership interests in other tax credit entities are accounted for under either the cost or equity method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporation&#8217;s involvement in LIHTC entities and other tax credit entities at December 31, 2022 was limited to $ 475 million and $ 31 million, respectively. \n\nInvestment balances, including all legally binding commitments to fund future investments, are included in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A liability is recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all legally binding unfunded commitments to fund tax credit entities ($ 208 million at December 31, 2022). Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income, while amortization and write-downs of other tax credit investments are recorded in other noninterest income. The income tax credits and deductions are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and a reduction of federal income taxes payable. \n\nThe Corporation provided no financial or other support that was not contractually required to any of the above VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nThe following table summarizes the impact of these tax credit entities on the Corporation&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Other noninterest income: Amortization of other tax credit investments $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 1 &#160; Provision for income taxes: Amortization of LIHTC Investments 72 &#160; $ 71 &#160; 67 &#160; Low income housing tax credits ( 68 ) ( 68 ) ( 63 ) Other tax benefits related to tax credit entities ( 18 ) ( 17 ) ( 16 ) Total provision for income taxes $ ( 14 ) $ ( 14 ) $ ( 12 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nFor further information on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidation policy, see Note 1. \n\nNOTE 10 - DEPOSITS \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit and other deposits with a stated maturity were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) &#160; Years Ending December 31 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n2023 $ 1,789 &#160; 2024 88 &#160; 2025 24 &#160; 2026 18 &#160; 2027 13 &#160; Thereafter 5 &#160; Total $ 1,937 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nA maturity distribution of domestic certificates of deposit of $100,000 and over follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) &#160; &#160; December 31 2022 2021 Three months or less $ 220 &#160; $ 436 &#160; Over three months to six months 136 &#160; 314 &#160; Over six months to twelve months 590 &#160; 319 &#160; Over twelve months 49 &#160; 74 &#160; Total $ 995 &#160; $ 1,143 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nF-74 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nThe aggregate amount of domestic certificates of deposit that meet or exceed the current FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 was $ 478 million and $ 627 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All foreign office time deposits were in denominations of $250,000 or more and totaled $ 51 million and $ 50 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . \n\nNOTE 11 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS \n\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Other short-term borrowings, which may consist of borrowed securities and short-term notes, generally mature within one to 120 days from the transaction date. At December 31, 2022, other short-term borrowings consisted of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related loans, certain government agency-backed securities and other eligible assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, $ 9.5 billion of real estate-related loans and $ 1.0 billion of investment securities were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for the short-term advances and provided an additional $ 7.2 billion for potential future borrowings. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Comerica Bank (the Bank), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, had pledged loans totaling $ 24.5 billion, which provided for up to $ 19.6 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB. \n\nThe following table provides a summary of short-term borrowings. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Other Short-term Borrowings December 31, 2022 Amount outstanding at year-end $ 11 &#160; $ 3,200 &#160; Weighted average interest rate at year-end 4.32 &#160; % 4.54 &#160; % Maximum month-end balance during the year $ 1,106 &#160; $ 3,200 &#160; Average balance outstanding during the year 82 &#160; 354 &#160; Weighted average interest rate during the year 3.28 &#160; % 4.08 &#160; % December 31, 2021 Amount outstanding at year-end $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Weighted average interest rate at year-end &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % Maximum month-end balance during the year $ 2 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Average balance outstanding during the year 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Weighted average interest rate during the year 0.06 &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % December 31, 2020 Amount outstanding at year-end $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Weighted average interest rate at year-end &#8212; &#160; % &#8212; &#160; % Maximum month-end balance during the year $ 1,513 &#160; $ 1,250 &#160; Average balance outstanding during the year 30 &#160; 284 &#160; Weighted average interest rate during the year 0.97 &#160; % 0.25 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nF-75 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nNOTE 12 - MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM DEBT \n\nMedium- and long-term debt is summarized as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) December 31 2022 2021 Parent company Subordinated notes: 3.80 % subordinated notes due 2026 (a) \n\n$ 237 &#160; $ 265 &#160; Medium- and long-term notes: 3.70 % notes due 2023 (a) \n\n841 &#160; 877 &#160; 4.00 % notes due 2029 (a) \n\n515 &#160; 594 &#160; Total medium- and long-term notes 1,356 &#160; 1,471 &#160; Total parent company 1,593 &#160; 1,736 &#160; Subsidiaries Subordinated notes: 4.00 % subordinated notes due 2025 (a) \n\n331 &#160; 363 &#160; 7.875 % subordinated notes due 2026 (a) \n\n165 &#160; 190 &#160; 5.332 % subordinated notes due 2033 (a) \n\n459 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total subordinated notes 955 &#160; 553 &#160; Medium- and long-term notes: 2.50 % notes due 2024 (a) \n\n476 &#160; 507 &#160; Total subsidiaries 1,431 &#160; 1,060 &#160; Total medium- and long-term debt $ 3,024 &#160; $ 2,796 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The fixed interest rates on these notes have been swapped to a variable rate and designated in a hedging relationship. Accordingly, carrying value has been adjusted to reflect the change in the fair value of the debt as a result of changes in the benchmark rate. \n\nSubordinated notes with remaining maturities greater than one year qualify as Tier 2 capital. \n\nComerica Bank (the Bank), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, is a member of the FHLB, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The Bank held no outstanding long-term advances at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nIn third quarter 2022, the Bank issued $ 500 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2033 , with a rate of 5.332 % for the first ten years. The rate on the subordinated notes will reset on August 25, 2032 to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 261 basis points until called or matured. Additionally, the Bank entered into a fair value fixed-to-floating rate swap in which the Bank received a fixed rate of 2.67 % and will pay a floating rate based on the SOFR for the first 10 years. \n\nUnamortized debt issuance costs deducted from the carrying amount of medium- and long-term debt totaled $ 9 million and $ 7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the principal maturities of medium- and long-term debt were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) &#160; Years Ending December 31 \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\n2023 $ 850 &#160; 2024 500 &#160; 2025 350 &#160; 2026 400 &#160; 2027 &#8212; &#160; Thereafter 1,050 &#160; Total $ 3,150 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 13 - SHAREHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY \n\nIn March 2020, as the economic climate grew increasingly uncertain, the Corporation temporarily suspended its share repurchase program, initially authorized in 2010 by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, with a focus on deploying capital to meet customers' growing financial requirements. In the second quarter 2021, share repurchases were resumed under the share repurchase program, including an Accelerated Share Repurchase transaction (ASR). On April 27, 2021, the Corporation's Board \n\nF-76 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nof Directors approved the authorization to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock, including the ASR. \n\nRepurchases of common stock under the share repurchase program totaled 377 thousand shares at an average price paid of $ 92.61 in 2022, 9.5 million shares at an average price paid of $ 75.82 per share in 2021 and 3.2 million shares at an average price paid of $ 58.55 per share in 2020. There is no expiration date for the share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Corporation repurchased $ 35 million under the share repurchase program. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Corporation had 4.2 million shares of common stock reserved for stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting. \n\nIn May 2020, the Corporation issued and sold 400,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of 5.625 % Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, without par value, with a liquidation preference of $ 100,000 per share (equivalent of 1,000 per depositary share). Holders of the depositary shares will be entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Series A preferred stock (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). The $ 400 million issuance yielded $ 394 million in proceeds net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. Dividends on the Series A preferred stock accrue on a non-cumulative basis and are payable in arrears when, as and if authorized by the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board and declared by the Corporation, on the first day of January, April, July and October of each year, and commenced on October 1, 2020. Under the terms of the Series A preferred stock, the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any other stock ranking on parity with or junior to the Series A preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Corporation does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the Series A preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period. The Series A preferred stock is perpetual and has no maturity date, but is redeemable by the Corporation at specified times subject to regulatory considerations. \n\nF-77 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nNOTE 14 - ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME \n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and details the components of other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, including the amount of income tax (benefit) expense allocated to each component of other comprehensive (loss) income. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Accumulated net unrealized losses on investment securities: Balance at beginning of period, net of tax $ ( 99 ) $ 211 &#160; $ 65 &#160; Net unrealized (losses) gains arising during the period ( 2,903 ) ( 406 ) 191 &#160; Less: (Benefit) provision for income taxes ( 683 ) ( 96 ) 45 &#160; Change in net unrealized (losses) gains on investment securities, net of tax ( 2,220 ) ( 310 ) 146 &#160; Balance at end of period, net of tax $ ( 2,319 ) $ ( 99 ) $ 211 &#160; Accumulated net (losses) gains on cash flow hedges: Balance at beginning of period, net of tax $ 55 &#160; $ 155 &#160; $ 34 &#160; Net cash flow hedge (losses) gains arising during the period ( 1,329 ) ( 35 ) 229 &#160; Less: (Benefit) provision for income taxes ( 313 ) ( 8 ) 56 &#160; Change in net cash flow hedge (losses) gains arising during the period, net of tax ( 1,016 ) ( 27 ) 173 &#160; Less: Net cash flow (losses) gains included in interest and fees on loans ( 25 ) 95 &#160; 70 &#160; Less: (Benefit) provision for income taxes ( 6 ) 22 &#160; 18 &#160; Reclassification adjustment for net cash flow hedge (losses) gains included in net income, net of tax ( 19 ) 73 &#160; 52 &#160; Change in net cash flow hedge (losses) gains, net of tax ( 997 ) ( 100 ) 121 &#160; Balance at end of period, net of tax (a) $ ( 942 ) $ 55 &#160; $ 155 &#160; Accumulated defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment: Balance at beginning of period, net of tax $ ( 168 ) $ ( 302 ) $ ( 415 ) Actuarial (loss) gain arising during the period ( 415 ) 159 &#160; 128 &#160; Prior service credit arising during the period &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment arising during the period ( 415 ) 160 &#160; 128 &#160; Less: (Benefit) provision for income taxes ( 98 ) 38 &#160; 31 &#160; Net defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment arising during the period, net of tax ( 317 ) 122 &#160; 97 &#160; Amounts recognized in other noninterest expenses: Amortization of actuarial net loss 28 &#160; 40 &#160; 47 &#160; Amortization of prior service credit ( 23 ) ( 25 ) ( 27 ) Total amounts recognized in other noninterest expenses 5 &#160; 15 &#160; 20 &#160; Less: Provision for income taxes 1 &#160; 3 &#160; 4 &#160; Adjustment for amounts recognized as components of net periodic benefit credit during the period, net of tax 4 &#160; 12 &#160; 16 &#160; Change in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment, net of tax ( 313 ) 134 &#160; 113 &#160; Balance at end of period, net of tax $ ( 481 ) $ ( 168 ) $ ( 302 ) Total accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at end of period, net of tax $ ( 3,742 ) $ ( 212 ) $ 64 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The Corporation expects to reclassify $428 million of losses, net of tax, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings over the next twelve months if interest yield curves and notional amounts remain at December 31, 2022 levels. \n\nF-78 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nNOTE 15 - NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \n\nBasic and diluted net income per common share are presented in the following table. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data) Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Basic and diluted Net income $ 1,151 &#160; $ 1,168 &#160; $ 497 &#160; Less: Income allocated to participating securities 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 2 &#160; Preferred stock dividends 23 &#160; 23 &#160; 13 &#160; Net income attributable to common shares $ 1,122 &#160; $ 1,140 &#160; $ 482 &#160; Basic average common shares 131 &#160; 135 &#160; 139 &#160; Basic net income per common share $ 8.56 &#160; $ 8.45 &#160; $ 3.45 &#160; Basic average common shares 131 &#160; 135 &#160; 139 &#160; Dilutive common stock equivalents: Net effect of the assumed exercise of stock awards 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 1 &#160; Diluted average common shares 133 &#160; 137 &#160; 140 &#160; Diluted net income per common share $ 8.47 &#160; $ 8.35 &#160; $ 3.43 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDeclared dividends on preferred stock are excluded from net income attributable to common shares.

Restricted stock units fully vest after a period ranging from three years to five years, and stock options fully vest after four years. A majority of share-based compensation awards include a retirement eligibility clause where qualified employees are exempt from the service requirements of the award. This generally results in the recognition of compensation expense at the grant date for retirement eligible employees. The maturity of each option is determined at the date of grant; however, no options may be exercised later than ten years from the date of grant. The options may have restrictions regarding exercisability. The plans provide for a grant of up to 7.7 million common shares, plus shares under certain plans that are \n\nF-79 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nforfeited, expire or are canceled, which become available for re-grant. At December 31, 2022, over 4.5 million shares were available for grant. \n\nThe Corporation used a binomial model to value stock options granted in the periods presented. Option valuation models require several inputs, including the expected stock price volatility, and changes in input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model used may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption used in the binomial option-pricing model as outlined in the table below was based on the federal ten-year treasury interest rate. The expected dividend yield was based on the historical and projected long-term dividend yield patterns of the Corporation&#8217;s common shares. Expected volatility assumptions considered both the historical volatility of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock over a ten-year period and implied volatility based on actively traded options on the Corporation&#8217;s common stock with pricing terms and trade dates similar to the stock options granted. Expected option life was based on historical exercise activity over the contractual term of the option grant (ten years), excluding certain forced transactions. \n\nThe estimated weighted-average grant-date fair value per option and the underlying binomial option-pricing model assumptions are summarized in the following table: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average grant-date fair value per option $ 25.31 &#160; $ 18.36 &#160; $ 13.03 &#160; Weighted-average assumptions: Risk-free interest rates 1.78 &#160; % 1.05 &#160; % 1.65 &#160; % Expected dividend yield 4.00 &#160; 4.00 &#160; 4.14 &#160; Volatility 34 &#160; 39 &#160; 27 &#160; Expected option life (in years) 8.0 &#160; 7.8 8.4 ##TABLE_END\n\nA summary of the Corporation&#8217;s stock option activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2022 follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Weighted-Average &#160; &#160; Number of Options (in thousands) Exercise Price per Share Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) \n\nOutstanding-January 1, 2022 \n\n2,244 &#160; $ 57.50 &#160; Granted 183 &#160; 92.58 &#160; Forfeited or expired ( 32 ) 76.55 &#160; Exercised ( 387 ) 50.64 &#160; \n\nOutstanding-December 31, 2022 \n\n2,008 &#160; 61.71 &#160; 5.1 &#160; $ 22 &#160; \n\nExercisable-December 31, 2022 \n\n1,379 &#160; $ 57.20 &#160; 3.9 &#160; $ 20 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options shown in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value at December 31, 2022, based on the Corporation&#8217;s closing stock price of $ 66.85 at December 31, 2022. \n\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $ 17 million, $ 29 million and $ 6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nA summary of the Corporation&#8217;s restricted stock activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2022 follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Shares (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share \n\nOutstanding-January 1, 2022 \n\n41 61.64 &#160; Forfeited &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Vested ( 41 ) 67.69 &#160; \n\nOutstanding-December 31, 2022 \n\n&#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock awards that fully vested was $ 4 million, $ 8 million and $ 17 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nF-80 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nA summary of the Corporation's restricted stock unit activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2022 follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Service-Based Units Performance-Based Units Number of Units (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share Number of Units (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value per Share \n\nOutstanding-January 1, 2022 \n\n1,346 &#160; $ 59.18 &#160; 816 &#160; $ 63.12 &#160; Granted 361 &#160; 84.14 &#160; 182 &#160; 87.45 &#160; Forfeited ( 70 ) 65.24 &#160; ( 34 ) 70.40 &#160; Vested (a) ( 232 ) 65.36 &#160; ( 220 ) 79.13 &#160; \n\nOutstanding-December 31, 2022 \n\n1,405 &#160; 64.27 &#160; 744 &#160; 64.01 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Includes performance-based units valued at zero, as they did not meet the minimum performance threshold. \n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock units that fully vested was $ 19 million, $ 21 million and $ 12 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Corporation expects to satisfy the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock units and future grants of restricted stock by issuing shares of common stock out of treasury.

In October 2016, the Corporation modified its defined benefit pension plans to freeze final average pay benefits as of December 31, 2016, other than for participants who were age 60 or older as of December 31, 2016, and added a cash balance plan provision effective January 1, 2017. Active pension plan participants 60 years or older as of December 31, 2016 receive the greater of the final average pay formula or the frozen final average pay benefit as of December 31, 2016 plus the cash balance benefit earned after January 1, 2017. Employees participating in the retirement account plan as of December 31, 2016 were eligible to participate in the cash balance pension plan effective January 1, 2017. Benefits earned under the cash balance pension formula, in the form of an account balance, include contribution credits based on eligible pay earned each month, age and years of service and monthly interest credits based on the 30-year Treasury rate. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s postretirement benefit plan provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for retirees as of December 31, 1992. The plan also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a limited number of retirees who retired prior to January 1, 2000. For all other employees hired prior to January 1, 2000, a nominal benefit is provided. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2000 and prior to January 1, 2007 are eligible to participate in the plan on a full contributory basis until Medicare-eligible based on age and service. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the plan. The Corporation funds the pre-1992 retiree plan benefits with bank-owned life insurance. Effective January 1, 2022, the plan moved from a self-insured plan to the Medicare and pre-65 individual marketplace with a funded Health Reimbursement Arrangement account for those with subsidized coverage. This change did not have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. \n\nF-81 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nThe following table sets forth reconciliations of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, the weighted-average assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations, and the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the Corporation&#8217;s defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is set after considering both long-term returns in the general market and long-term returns experienced by the assets in the plan. The returns on the various asset categories are blended to derive an equity and a fixed income long-term rate of return. The Corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations. \n\nF-83 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nPlan Assets \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s overall investment goals for the qualified defined benefit pension plan are to maintain a portfolio of assets of appropriate liquidity and diversification; to generate investment returns (net of all operating costs) that are reasonably anticipated to maintain the plan&#8217;s fully funded status or to reduce a funding deficit, after taking into account various factors, including reasonably anticipated future contributions, expense and the interest rate sensitivity of the plan&#8217;s assets relative to that of the plan&#8217;s liabilities; and to generate investment returns (net of all operating costs) that meet or exceed a customized benchmark as defined in the plan's investment policy. Derivative instruments are permissible for hedging and transactional efficiency, but only to the extent that the derivative use enhances the efficient execution of the plan&#8217;s investment policy. The plan does not directly invest in securities issued by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Corporation&#8217;s target allocations for plan investments are 40 percent to 50 percent for equity securities and 50 percent to 60 percent for fixed income, including cash. Equity securities include collective investment and mutual funds and common stock. Fixed income securities include U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and notes, municipal bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and money market funds. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s qualified defined benefit pension plan utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments and to determine fair value disclosures. The Corporation&#8217;s qualified benefit pension plan categorizes investments recorded at fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the markets in which the investment are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Refer to Note 1 for a description of the three-level hierarchy. \n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure the fair value of the Corporation&#8217;s qualified defined benefit pension plan investments, including an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the investments are classified. \n\nMutual funds \n\nFair value measurement is based upon the net asset value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. Mutual fund NAVs are quoted in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, and are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nCommon stock \n\nFair value measurement is based upon the closing price quoted in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 1 common stock includes domestic and foreign stock and real estate investment trusts. \n\nU.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities \n\nLevel 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices in an active market exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Level 2 securities include debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored entities. The fair value of Level 2 securities is determined using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates and spreads. \n\nCorporate and municipal bonds and notes \n\nFair value measurement is based upon quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or pricing models based on observable market data inputs, primarily interest rates, spreads and prepayment information. Level 2 securities include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, foreign bonds and foreign notes. \n\nMortgage-backed securities \n\nFair value measurement is based upon independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors, such as credit loss and liquidity assumptions, and are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nPrivate placements \n\nFair value is measured using the NAV provided by fund management as quoted prices in active markets are not available. Management considers additional discounts to the provided NAV for market and credit risk. Private placements are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nF-84 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\n&#160; Collective investment funds \n\nFair value measurement is based upon the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. There are no unfunded commitments or redemption restrictions on the collective investment funds. The investments are redeemable daily. \n\n&#160; Fair Values \n\nThe fair values of the Corporation&#8217;s qualified defined benefit pension plan investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category and level within the fair value hierarchy, are detailed in the table below. \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2022 Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities $ 534 &#160; $ 531 &#160; $ 3 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Corporate and municipal bonds and notes 676 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 676 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 20 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Private placements 39 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 39 &#160; Total investments in the fair value hierarchy $ 1,269 &#160; $ 531 &#160; $ 699 &#160; $ 39 &#160; Investments measured at net asset value: Collective investment funds 1,230 &#160; Total investments at fair value $ 2,499 &#160; December 31, 2021 Fixed income securities: U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities $ 599 &#160; $ 595 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Corporate and municipal bonds and notes 893 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 893 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mortgage-backed securities 27 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 27 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Private placements 50 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 50 &#160; Total investments in the fair value hierarchy $ 1,569 &#160; $ 595 &#160; $ 924 &#160; $ 50 &#160; Investments measured at net asset value: Collective investment funds 1,885 &#160; Total investments at fair value $ 3,454 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe table below provides a summary of changes in the Corporation&#8217;s qualified defined benefit pension plan&#8217;s Level 3 investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START Balance at Beginning of Period Balance at End of Period Net Gains (Losses) (in millions) Realized Unrealized Purchases Sales Year Ended December 31, 2022 Private placements $ 50 &#160; $ ( 3 ) $ ( 12 ) $ 38 &#160; $ ( 34 ) $ 39 &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2021 Private placements $ 58 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ ( 4 ) $ 44 &#160; $ ( 50 ) $ 50 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThere were no assets in the non-qualified defined benefit pension plan at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Under this plan, the Corporation makes core matching cash contributions of 100 percent of the first 4 percent of qualified earnings contributed by employees (up to the current IRS compensation limit), invested based on employee investment elections. Employee benefits expense included expense for the plan of $ 24 million for the each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nDeferred Compensation Plans \n\nThe Corporation offers optional deferred compensation plans under which certain employees and non-employee directors (participants) may make an irrevocable election to defer incentive compensation and/or a portion of base salary until retirement or separation from the Corporation. The participant may direct deferred compensation into one or more deemed investment options. Although not required to do so, the Corporation invests actual funds into the deemed investments as directed by participants, resulting in a deferred compensation asset, recorded in other short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that offsets the liability to participants under the plan, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The earnings from the deferred compensation asset are recorded in interest on short-term investments and other noninterest income and the related change in the liability to participants under the plan is recorded in salaries and benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nNOTE 18 - INCOME TAXES AND TAX-RELATED ITEMS \n\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated as the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes. Income taxes due for the current year are computed by applying federal and state tax statutes to current year taxable income. Deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities. Tax-related interest and penalties and foreign taxes are then added to the tax provision. \n\nThe current and deferred components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; December 31 2022 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ 296 &#160; $ 212 &#160; $ 171 &#160; Foreign 6 &#160; 5 &#160; 5 &#160; State and local 50 &#160; 26 &#160; 30 &#160; Total current 352 &#160; 243 &#160; 206 &#160; Deferred: Federal ( 24 ) 62 &#160; ( 73 ) State and local ( 3 ) 17 &#160; ( 9 ) Total deferred ( 27 ) 79 &#160; ( 82 ) Total $ 325 &#160; $ 322 &#160; $ 124 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome before income taxes of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 included $ 48 million of foreign taxable income. \n\nF-86 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nThe provision for income taxes does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available-for-sale, hedging transactions or the change in defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. \n\nA reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the Corporation&#8217;s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Years Ended December 31 Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate Tax based on federal statutory rate $ 310 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 313 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % $ 130 &#160; 21.0 &#160; % State income taxes 36 &#160; 2.5 &#160; 35 &#160; 2.4 &#160; 18 &#160; 2.9 &#160; Affordable housing and historic credits ( 13 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 13 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 12 ) ( 1.9 ) Bank-owned life insurance ( 10 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 10 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 10 ) ( 1.6 ) FDIC insurance expense 6 &#160; 0.4 &#160; 5 &#160; 0.3 &#160; 7 &#160; 1.1 &#160; Employee stock transactions ( 3 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 3 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 1 ) ( 0.2 ) Tax-related interest and penalties &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) ( 0.3 ) Other ( 1 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 5 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 6 ) ( 1.0 ) Provision for income taxes $ 325 &#160; 22.0 &#160; % $ 322 &#160; 21.6 &#160; % $ 124 &#160; 20.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe liability for tax-related interest and penalties, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $ 5 million and $ 6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into certain transactions that have tax consequences. From time to time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may review and/or challenge specific interpretive tax positions taken by the Corporation with respect to those transactions. The Corporation believes that its tax returns were filed based upon applicable statutes, regulations and case law in effect at the time of the transactions. The IRS or other tax jurisdictions, an administrative authority or a court, if presented with the transactions, could disagree with the Corporation&#8217;s interpretation of the tax law. \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of net unrecognized tax benefits follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 $ 18 &#160; $ 19 &#160; $ 17 &#160; (Decrease) increase as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period ( 2 ) 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Increase as a result of tax positions taken during the current period 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 2 &#160; Decreases related to settlements with tax authorities ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 1 ) Reduction as a result of expiration of statute of limitations &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; Balance at December 31 $ 16 &#160; $ 18 &#160; $ 19 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAfter consideration of the effect of the federal tax benefit available on unrecognized state tax benefits, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the Corporation&#8217;s effective tax rate was approximately $ 13 million and $ 14 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe following tax years for significant jurisdictions remain subject to examination as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Jurisdiction Tax Years Federal 2019 - 2021 \n\nNew York 2018 - 2021 \n\nCalifornia 2006 - 2007 , 2018 - 2021 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Corporation expects to enter into a settlement agreement with the California Franchise Tax Board related to open years 2006 and 2007 that will result in a change in net unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. As a result of the agreement, the Corporation anticipates a favorable change of approximately $ 4 million in tax and $ 3 million in interest and penalties. \n\nBased on current knowledge and probability assessment of various potential outcomes, the Corporation believes current tax reserves are adequate, and the amount of any potential incremental liability arising is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary. \n\nF-87 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nDuring 2022, the Corporation received a favorable ruling from the Michigan Supreme Court in its petition to the state for its tax credit transfer regarding tax years 2008 through 2011. The Corporation has recorded a non-income tax benefit of $ 4 million, with the expectation of another $ 7 million to be recognized in the following year (amounts are not inclusive of interest.) \n\nThe principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) &#160; &#160; December 31 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Allowance for depreciation $ &#8212; &#160; $ 7 &#160; Allowance for loan losses 128 &#160; 124 &#160; Deferred compensation 84 &#160; 71 &#160; Deferred loan origination fees and costs 12 &#160; 17 &#160; Net hedging losses 290 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Net unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale 713 &#160; 30 &#160; Operating lease liabilities 85 &#160; 74 &#160; Other temporary differences, net 42 &#160; 21 &#160; Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 1,354 &#160; 344 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Total deferred tax assets 1,349 &#160; 339 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Lease financing transactions ( 31 ) ( 49 ) Defined benefit plans ( 123 ) ( 198 ) Allowance for depreciation ( 4 ) &#8212; &#160; Net hedging gains &#8212; &#160; ( 17 ) Leasing Right of Use assets ( 71 ) ( 66 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 229 ) ( 330 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,120 &#160; $ 9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDeferred tax assets included $ 4 million and $ 3 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, expiring between 2028 and 2031 . In addition, there were $ 2 million and $ 3 million of state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, expiring between 2023 and 2041 . The Corporation believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from federal foreign tax credits and certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized and, accordingly, maintains a federal valuation allowance of $ 4 million and a state valuation allowance of $ 1 million at December 31, 2022, compared to a federal valuation of $ 3 million and a state valuation allowance of $ 2 million in the comparable period in 2021. For further information on the Corporation&#8217;s valuation policy for deferred tax assets, refer to Note 1. \n\nNOTE 19 - TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries had, and expect to have in the future, transactions with the Corporation&#8217;s directors and executive officers, companies with which these individuals are associated and certain related individuals. Such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business and included extensions of credit, leases and professional services. With respect to extensions of credit, all were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with other customers and did not, in management&#8217;s opinion, involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount of loans attributable to persons who were related parties at December 31, 2022 totaled $ 74 million at the beginning of 2022 and $ 57 million at the end of 2022. During 2022, new loans to related parties aggregated $ 270 million and repayments totaled $ 287 million. \n\nNOTE 20 - REGULATORY CAPITAL \n\nBanking regulations limit the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans or advances from the bank subsidiaries to the parent company. Under the most restrictive of these regulations, the aggregate amount of dividends which can be paid to the parent company, with prior approval from bank regulatory agencies, approximated $ 506 million at January 1, 2023, plus 2023 net profits. Substantially all the assets of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are restricted from transfer to the parent company of the Corporation in the form of loans or advances. \n\nF-88 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks declared dividends of $ 1.0 billion, $ 852 million and $ 498 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies under the Basel III regulatory framework (Basel III). This regulatory framework establishes comprehensive methodologies for calculating regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets (RWA). Basel III also set minimum capital ratios as well as overall capital adequacy standards. \n\nUnder Basel III, regulatory capital comprises Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders' equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation and its Bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, of 2.5 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. \n\nThe Corporation computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors. \n\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital (as defined in the regulations) to average and/or risk-weighted assets. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Corporation&#8217;s financial statements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;. For U.S. banking subsidiaries, those requirements were total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, CET1 risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than 10 percent, 8 percent, 6.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the Corporation, requirements to be considered \"well capitalized\" were total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios greater than 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2022 that management believes have changed the capital adequacy classification of the Corporation or its U.S. banking subsidiaries. \n\nF-89 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nThe following is a summary of the capital position of the Corporation and Comerica Bank, its principal banking subsidiary. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) Comerica Incorporated (Consolidated) Comerica Bank December 31, 2022 CET1 capital (minimum $ 3.5 billion (Consolidated)) \n\n$ 7,884 &#160; $ 7,801 &#160; Tier 1 capital (minimum $ 4.7 billion (Consolidated)) \n\n8,278 &#160; 7,801 &#160; Total capital (minimum $ 6.3 billion (Consolidated)) \n\n9,817 &#160; 9,190 &#160; Risk-weighted assets 78,871 &#160; 78,781 &#160; Average assets (fourth quarter) 86,726 &#160; 86,608 &#160; CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum- 4.5 %) \n\n10.00 &#160; % 9.90 &#160; % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum- 6.0 %) \n\n10.50 &#160; 9.90 &#160; Total capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum- 8.0 %) \n\n12.45 &#160; 11.67 &#160; Tier 1 capital to average assets (minimum- 4.0 %) \n\n9.55 &#160; 9.01 &#160; Capital conservation buffer (minimum- 2.5 %) \n\n4.45 &#160; 3.67 &#160; December 31, 2021 CET1 capital (minimum $ 3.1 billion (Consolidated)) \n\n$ 7,064 &#160; $ 7,634 &#160; Tier 1 capital (minimum $ 4.2 billion (Consolidated)) \n\n7,458 &#160; 7,634 &#160; Total capital (minimum $ 5.6 billion (Consolidated)) \n\n8,608 &#160; 8,584 &#160; Risk-weighted assets 69,708 &#160; 69,542 &#160; Average assets (fourth quarter) 96,417 &#160; 96,216 &#160; CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum- 4.5 %) \n\n10.13 &#160; % 10.98 &#160; % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum- 6.0 %) \n\n10.70 &#160; 10.98 &#160; Total capital to risk-weighted assets (minimum- 8.0 %) \n\n12.35 &#160; 12.34 &#160; Tier 1 capital to average assets (minimum- 4.0 %) \n\n7.74 &#160; 7.93 &#160; Capital conservation buffer (minimum- 2.5 %) \n\n4.35 &#160; 4.34 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 21 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \n\nLegal Proceedings and Regulatory Matters \n\nThe Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various other pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations. The Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its other currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management&#8217;s judgment as to what is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. Settlement may result from the Corporation's determination that it may be more prudent financially to settle, rather than litigate, and should not be regarded as an admission of liability. \n\nFurther, from time to time, the Corporation is also subject to examinations, inquiries and investigations by regulatory authorities in areas including, but not limited to, compliance, risk management and consumer protection, which could lead to administrative or legal proceedings or settlements. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) is investigating certain of the Corporation's practices, and the Corporation has responded and continues to respond to the CFPB. We are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions at this time. Remedies in these proceedings or settlements may include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in the Corporation's business practices and may result in increased operating expenses or decreased revenues. \n\nOn at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its potential liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings and regulatory matters utilizing the latest information available. On a case-by-case basis, accruals are established for those legal claims and regulatory matters for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these claims and regulatory matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued. Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes current accruals are adequate, and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Legal fees of $ 17 million, $ 14 million and $ 17 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were included in other noninterest expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nFor matters where a loss is not probable, the Corporation has not established an accrual. The Corporation believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of established accruals, for all legal proceedings and \n\nF-90 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nregulatory matters in which it is involved is from zero to approximately $ 80 million at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters in which the Corporation is involved, taking into account the Corporation&#8217;s best estimate of such losses for those legal cases and regulatory matters for which such estimate can be made. For certain legal cases and regulatory matters, the Corporation does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Corporation&#8217;s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the legal proceedings and regulatory matters (including the fact many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in certain legal proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Corporation) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the legal proceedings and regulatory matters (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such legal proceedings and regulatory matters. Accordingly, the Corporation&#8217;s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. \n\nIn the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Corporation's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, refer to Note 18. \n\nNOTE 22 - STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS \n\nThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Commercial Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. Business segment results are produced by the Corporation&#8217;s internal management accounting system. This system measures financial results based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each business segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. From time to time, the Corporation may make reclassifications among the segments to more appropriately reflect management's current view of the segments, and methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on business unit structure and methodologies in effect at December 31, 2022. \n\nNet interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits and charges. The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. This credit or charge is based on matching stated or implied maturities for these assets and liabilities. The FTP crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturity. Due to the longer-term nature of implied maturities, FTP crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. As a result of applying matched funding, interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds, as well as the volume of deposits at the associated FTP crediting rates. Generally, in periods of rising interest rates, FTP charge rates for funding loans and FTP crediting rates on deposits will increase, with FTP crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than FTP charge rates for funding loans. \n\nFor acquired loans and deposits, matched maturity funding is determined based on origination date. Accordingly, the FTP process reflects the transfer of interest rate risk exposures to the Corporate Treasury department within the Finance segment, where such exposures are centrally managed. The allowance for credit losses is allocated to the business segments based on the methodology used to estimate the consolidated allowance for credit losses described in Note 1. The related provision for credit losses is assigned based on the amount necessary to maintain an allowance for credit losses appropriate for each business segment. Noninterest income and expenses directly attributable to a line of business are assigned to that business segment. Direct expenses incurred by areas whose services support the overall Corporation are allocated to the business segments as follows: product processing expenditures are allocated based on standard unit costs applied to actual volume measurements; administrative expenses are allocated based on estimated time expended; and corporate overhead is assigned 50 percent based on the ratio of the business segment&#8217;s noninterest expenses to total noninterest expenses incurred by all business \n\nF-91 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nsegments and 50 percent based on the ratio of the business segment&#8217;s attributed equity to total attributed equity of all business segments. Equity is attributed based on credit, operational and interest rate risks. Most of the equity attributed relates to credit risk, which is determined based on the credit score and expected remaining life of each loan, letter of credit and unused commitment recorded in the business segments. Operational risk is allocated based on loans and letters of credit, deposit balances, non-earning assets, trust assets under management, certain noninterest income items, and the nature and extent of expenses incurred by business units. Virtually all interest rate risk is assigned to Finance, as are the Corporation&#8217;s hedging activities. \n\nThe following discussion provides information about the activities of each business segment. A discussion of the financial results and the factors impacting 2022 performance can be found in \"Strategic Lines of Business\" section of the financial review. \n\nThe Commercial Bank meets the needs of small and middle market businesses, multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services including commercial loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, payment solutions, card services, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services. \n\nThe Retail Bank includes a full range of personal financial services, consisting of consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination. This business segment offers a variety of consumer products, including deposit accounts, installment loans, credit cards, student loans, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans. In addition, \n\nthis business segment offers a subset of commercial products and services to micro-businesses whose primary contact is through the branch network. \n\nWealth Management offers products and services consisting of fiduciary services, private banking, retirement services, securities-based lending, investment management and advisory services, investment banking and brokerage services. This business segment also offers the sale of annuity products, as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance products. \n\nThe Finance segment includes the Corporation&#8217;s securities portfolio and asset and liability management activities. This segment is responsible for managing the Corporation&#8217;s funding, liquidity and capital needs, performing interest sensitivity analysis and executing various strategies to manage the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to liquidity, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. \n\nThe Other category includes the income and expense impact of equity and cash, tax benefits not assigned to specific business segments, charges of an unusual or infrequent nature that are not reflective of the normal operations of the business segments and miscellaneous other expenses of a corporate nature. \n\nF-92 \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nComerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries \n\nBusiness segment financial results are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollar amounts in millions) Commercial Bank Retail Bank Wealth Management Finance Other Total Year Ended December 31, 2022 Earnings summary: Net interest income (expense) $ 1,753 &#160;

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts which of necessity are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgments and give due consideration to materiality. The other financial information herein is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the consolidated financial statements, management develops and maintains effective internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Corporation&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n\nManagement assessed, with participation of the Corporation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as of December 31, 2022. The assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on this assessment, management determined that internal control over financial reporting is effective as it relates to the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as of December 31, 2022. \n\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nThe Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report. \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors oversees management&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and financial reporting responsibilities through its Audit Committee as well as various other committees. The Audit Committee, which consists of directors who are not officers or employees of the Corporation, meets regularly with management, internal audit and the independent public accountants to assure that the Audit Committee, management, internal auditors and the independent public accountants are carrying out their responsibilities, and to review auditing, internal control and financial reporting matters. \n\n##TABLE_START Curtis C.

In our opinion, Comerica Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes of the Corporation and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Corporation&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nDallas, Texas \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nF-102 \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Comerica Incorporated \n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Comerica Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 14, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nF-103 \n\n##TABLE_START Allowance for loan losses Description of the Matter The Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses (ACL) were $53.4 billion and $ 661 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses includes credit loss estimates for loans evaluated on an individual basis, such as for certain nonaccrual loans and collective loss estimates for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The Corporation determines the allowance for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics by applying loss factors to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life. Loss factors are based on estimated probability of default, set to a default horizon based on contractual life, and loss given default. Through the use of various models, historical estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on economic variables that statistically correlate with each of the probability of default and loss given default pools. Qualitative adjustments are then made to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for in the quantitative analysis. Examples of these adjustments include 1) foresight risk, 2) input imprecision, and 3) model imprecision. \n\nAuditing management&#8217;s estimate of the allowance for credit losses involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the highly judgmental nature of the expected loss models and the qualitative adjustments included in the ACL. Management applies significant judgment when selecting the expected loss models to be used to determine the allowance and the inputs used in those models as well as in applying qualitative adjustments. These determinations could have a significant effect on the ACL. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding of the Corporation&#8217;s process for establishing the ACL, including selection of the models, inputs used in the models, monitoring of the models, and the qualitative adjustments made to the ACL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over 1) determining the appropriateness of the models used to estimate quantitative components of the ACL, 2) validating the models used to estimate quantitative components of the ACL, 3) selecting the appropriate inputs and assumptions within the models, 4) monitoring of the models including the assessment of the output, 5) determining the appropriateness of the qualitative reserve methodology, including the identification and the assessment for the need for qualitative adjustments, 6) validating the relevance and reliability of data used to estimate the various components of the qualitative reserves, and 7) management&#8217;s review and approval of qualitative adjustments and model output. To test the appropriateness of the models used by management to estimate quantitative components of the ACL, with the support of specialists, we evaluated the model methodology and model performance, and tested key modeling assumptions used within the models. To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the identification and measurement of the qualitative adjustments, including the basis for concluding an adjustment was warranted when considering the potential impact of foresight risk, input imprecision and model imprecision, evaluated the appropriateness of the data used by the Corporation to estimate the qualitative adjustments, recalculated the analyses used by management to determine the qualitative adjustments, and analyzed the changes in assumptions and components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. For example, we evaluated the data and information utilized by management to estimate the qualitative adjustments by independently obtaining and comparing to historical loan data, third-party macroeconomic data, and peer bank data to assess the appropriateness of the information and to consider whether new or contradictory information existed. We also evaluated if qualitative adjustments were based on a comprehensive framework, well-documented, and consistently applied ##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1992. \n\nDallas, TX \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nF-104 \n\nSIGNATURES \n\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized as of February 14, 2023. \n\n##TABLE_START COMERICA INCORPORATED By: &#160; /s/ Curtis C.
