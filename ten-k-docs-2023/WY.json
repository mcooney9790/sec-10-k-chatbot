      "text": " OUR BUS INESS \n\nWeyerhaeuser Company is one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands. We own or control 10.6 million acres of timberlands in the U.S. and manage an additional 14.1 million acres of timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. We manage these timberlands on a sustainable basis in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. Our objective is to maximize the long-term value of timberlands we own. We analyze each timberland acre comprehensively to understand its highest-value use. We realize this value in many ways, most notably through growing and harvesting the trees, but also by selling properties when we can create incremental value. In addition, we focus on opportunities to realize value through lease and royalty agreements for the surface and subsurface rights that exist in our ownership. \n\nWe are also one of the largest manufacturers of wood products in North America. We manufacture and distribute high-quality wood products, including structural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and other specialty products. These products are primarily supplied to the residential, multi-family, repair and remodel, industrial and light commercial markets. We operate 35 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada. \n\nSustainability and citizenship are part of our core values. Our sustainably managed forests and our wood products play a critical role in mitigating climate change, and our carbon record shows that our net impact is significantly carbon negative. In addition to practicing sustainable forestry, we focus on energy and resource efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources and offering sustainable products that meet our customers' needs. We operate with world-class safety results, actively support the communities in which we operate and communicate transparently with our investors and other stakeholders. We are recognized for our leading performance in the areas of ethics, citizenship and gender equality. \n\nThis portion of our Annual Report on Form 10-K provides detailed information about who we are and what we do. Unless otherwise specified, current information reported in this Form 10-K is as of or for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Throughout this Form 10-K, unless specified otherwise, references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;the company&#8221; refer to the consolidated company. We break out financial information such as revenues, earnings and assets by the business segments that comprise our company. We also discuss the geographic areas where we do business. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWE CAN TEL L YOU MORE \n\n&#160; \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\nWe meet the information reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by filing periodic reports (annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q), current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports and statements, which contain information about our company&#8217;s business, financial results, corporate governance and other matters, as well as amendments to these reports and statements, are available at: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nthe SEC website &#8212; www.sec.gov and \n\n&#61623; \n\nour website (free of charge) &#8212; www.weyerhaeuser.com. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWhen we file or furnish information electronically with the SEC, it is also posted to our website. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWHO W E ARE \n\n&#160; \n\nWe were incorporated as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company in the state of Washington in January 1900, when Frederick Weyerhaeuser and 15 partners bought 900 thousand acres of timberland. Today, we are working to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company for our shareholders, customers and employees. \n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) \n\nWeyerhaeuser Company is a REIT and REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. We also own timberland assets through a subsidiary, Weyerhaeuser Timber Holdings, Inc., which qualifies as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), for tax years beginning 2022. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from our timberlands, including gains from the sales of our standing timber and rent from recreational leases. We are required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (TRSs), which include our Wood Products segment and a portion of our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segments. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nOUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS \n\nIn our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) section you will find discussion of our overall performance results for our business segments, which are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nTimberlands; \n\n&#61623; \n\nReal Estate, Energy and Natural Resources (Real Estate &#38; ENR) and \n\n&#61623; \n\nWood Products. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nDetailed financial information about our business segments and our geographic locations is provided in Note 2: Business Segments and Note 21: Geographic Areas . \n\nEFFECT OF MARKET CONDITIONS \n\nThe health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects the performance of all our business segments. Our Wood Products segment primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products as well as export markets. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., generally characterized by a reduction in activity during the winter months, which in turn affects the demand for our logs and wood products. Our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the U.S., and the evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets. \n\nCOMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS \n\nWe operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets, with numerous companies selling similar products. Many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood products. We compete in our markets primarily through product quality, service levels and price. We are relentlessly focused on operational excellence, producing quality products customers want and are willing to pay for, at the lowest possible cost. \n\nOur business segments&#8217; competitive strategies are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nTimberlands &#8212; Capture maximum timber value from every acre we own or manage. \n\n&#61623; \n\nReal Estate &#38; ENR &#8212; Deliver premiums to timberland value by identifying and monetizing higher and better use lands and capturing the full value of surface and subsurface assets. \n\n&#61623; \n\nWood Products &#8212; Manufacture high-quality structural lumber, oriented strand board and engineered wood products, as well as deliver complementary building products for residential, multi-family, industrial and light commercial applications at competitive costs. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) PRACTICES \n\n&#160; \n\nSustainability is one of the core values of our company and has been for over 100 years. We have spent decades building a solid foundation characterized by excellence in environmental stewardship, social responsibility and corporate governance. Maintaining a strong ESG foundation is a key component of our ability to drive long-term shareholder value, and these principles guide us in how we conduct our business every day. We successfully integrated sustainability into our business roadmaps, enabling employees across business lines to identify key sustainability levers and clearly see how their day-to-day work impacts our overall performance. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP \n\nAs a pioneer in sustainable forestry, we have environmental stewardship deeply rooted in our business and very much at the core of our company. To operate successfully, we need our forests to provide a sustainable supply of wood fiber now and long into the future. To ensure our forests remain healthy and valuable for decades to come, we protect and enhance the many additional benefits they provide, such as clean water, clean air, and critical areas for biodiversity. We also minimize our environmental footprint in our wood products manufacturing business, including reducing air emissions, minimizing waste and maximizing wood recovery. These actions are smart for our business, good for the environment and essential to how we run our operations sustainably. \n\nPRACTICING SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY \n\nAs one of the world&#8217;s oldest and largest private timberland owners, we&#8217;ve been growing, harvesting and regrowing forests for more than a century. Our goal is to ensure a sustainable supply of wood for our customers, while protecting the other important benefits forests provide. We know forests can be managed on a sustainable basis indefinitely, and we have been proving it is possible for a very long time. We advocated for legislation in 1925 to encourage reforestation after harvest, which was an uncommon practice at the time. In 1937, we began research into sustainable yield forestry, which ensures harvesting does not diminish the forest&#8217;s ability to provide the same volume in the future. In 1938, we were one of the first companies to plant tree seedlings, and in 1941 we established the first certified tree farm in the U.S. We harvest, on \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 2 \n\n&#160; \n\naverage, only two percent of our forests each year, and 100 percent of our timberlands are reforested after harvesting. On average, we plant 130 to 150 million tree seedlings per year, which equates to about 250 trees planted per minute throughout the year. \n\nCARBON RECORD \n\nWe are dedicated to maintaining a leadership position within our sector in the area of climate-related disclosures. In 2021, we reached a significant milestone in publishing our inaugural carbon record, which provides details of the total carbon impact enabled by our forests and wood products. Our carbon record shows that our net impact is significantly carbon negative, meaning we remove substantially more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit each year. \n\nIn total, our carbon emissions in 2021 were 7.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO 2 e), 0.9 million mtCO 2 e scope 1 and scope 2 emissions primarily attributable to fuel usage and purchased electricity within our Wood Products mills and 6.5 million mtCO 2 e scope 3 emissions primarily generated by customers who purchase our wood fiber and emissions associated with the products and services we buy. Our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. In 2022, we obtained limited assurance for our 2020 and 2021 scope 1 and location-based scope 2 emissions from a third-party attestation provider. Our scope 3 emissions are calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. \n\nOur sustainably managed forests play a critical role in helping to mitigate climate change. As our millions of acres of forests grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their trunks, limbs and roots, as well as in the soil. In 2021, our carbon removals totaled approximately 35 million mtCO 2 e. This was comprised of 14 million mtCO 2 e of direct carbon removals from our U.S. timberlands (the increase in above-ground carbon attributable to forest growth and management practices after we account for harvest and mortality) and an additional 21 million mtCO 2 e of scope 3 removals across our value chain (primarily carbon stored in our own long-lived wood products and products that our customers make from our logs). \n\nIn 2021, our forests contained between 2.3 billion and 3.6 billion mtCO 2 e. Approximately 1.0 billion mtCO 2 e was stored in our trees and roots, and an additional 1.3 billion to 2.6 billion mtCO 2 e was stored in soil and other biomass. After our trees are harvested, much of their carbon remains stored in the long-lived wood products made from them for the life of those products. After harvest, we plant millions more trees, which immediately begin absorbing more CO 2 from the atmosphere, and the next round of wood products store more carbon yet again. Our managed forests also provide other climate benefits. They mature more quickly and are able to bank more carbon through faster, continuous rotations, all while maintaining the vast pool of carbon in the forest soil. In addition, using wood for construction requires less energy and results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared with other building materials, such as steel and concrete. \n\nWe have a science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction target that has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative at the most ambitious level, in alignment with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. Our target includes a commitment to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42 percent overall, and our scope 3 emissions by 25 percent per ton of production, both by 2030, measured against a 2020 baseline. In 2022, we also joined The Climate Pledge, committing to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across our value chain by 2040. We expect to achieve these targets primarily through energy efficiency projects, increased renewable energy usage and supplier engagement. As companies across our value chain work to reduce their emissions, which many of them are already doing or have committed to do, we expect our scope 3 emissions to decrease over time. \n\nMAKING BETTER ENERGY CHOICES \n\nIn 2022, we committed to the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Better Plants Program to improve energy efficiency at our manufacturing facilities by 10 percent between 2020 and 2030. This partnership requires us to adopt a company-wide goal to improve energy efficiency, annually report our progress to the DOE and develop an energy management plan. We developed a comprehensive wood products energy strategy and have begun implementation of this strategy by developing short-term action plans, evaluation tools and energy champions at all sites. We also fully integrated greenhouse gas and energy metrics into capital planning processes and conducted energy audits at multiple manufacturing sites. On average, we meet more than 70 percent of our energy needs in our manufacturing facilities from renewable biomass by using what would otherwise be wood waste from mill manufacturing residuals to create our own energy. This approach allows us to reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuels and purchased electricity. We also support other renewable energy solutions, such as wind and solar power, through our timberlands. In addition, we also supply other mills, companies and utilities with woody biomass that is used to produce renewable, carbon-neutral energy. \n\nPROTECTING BIODIVERSITY \n\nThe forests we manage host hundreds of native vertebrate species, including large mammals such as deer, elk, cougar, black bear and bobcat, as well as a tremendous diversity of birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, native fish and other aquatic species. Many of these species prefer different forest age classes and forest structures, or other habitat features on the landscape, such as riparian areas. Since our timberlands contain a matrix of forest stand ages, along with other special areas we protect around streams and wetlands, these forests support a high level of native biodiversity. To preserve and protect this balance, we regularly conduct biodiversity assessments across our forests as part of our ongoing stewardship and forest management operations. These assessments include analyzing species occurrence data and assessing the presence of threatened, endangered, critically imperiled, imperiled and other regionally significant species. Conducting biodiversity assessments across our land base gives us necessary insights to help design and implement best practices for habitat conservation and species protection throughout the course of our forest management activities. These practices include leaving buffers along riparian areas, surveying sites for \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 3 \n\n&#160; \n\nspecies occurrences prior to harvesting and thinning activities, managing for specific habitat using prescribed burns or thinning harvests, or refraining from harvesting during certain sensitive times. \n\nIMPROVING CONSERVATION OUTCOMES \n\nEnsuring our forests provide habitat features that support at-risk, sensitive or threatened and endangered species is a core component of our environmental stewardship. We pursue a number of programs to create and preserve critical habitat, including partnering on conservation easements and agreements, formal Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) with the U.S. federal government and mitigation banking. Conservation easements and other local agreements can assure sustainable forest practices and the long-term stewardship and protection of wildlife habitat, biodiversity and recreational access. These partnerships can be made with a variety of groups and organizations, and they allow natural resource management to continue, which helps protect the economic benefits of a working forest. HCPs are administered under the federal Endangered Species Act and help provide more specific guidance on the protection and enhancement of habitats for threatened and endangered species. We currently participate in HCPs and other conservation agreements in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington. Authorized through the U.S. Clean Water Act, mitigation banking allows us to set aside certain areas of our timberlands to preserve, enhance or restore a wetland, stream or habitat area to make up for development by another entity in a similar nearby ecosystem. Mitigation banks are regulated and approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and a consortium of federal, state and local agencies. We currently operate 14 mitigation banks and projects, primarily in the U.S. South. Several other projects are in various stages of evaluation and development. Overall, we currently have approximately 4 million acres invested in these various conservation programs in our Northern, Southern and Western Timberlands, and we are always looking for new opportunities and partnerships to expand our impact. \n\nCONTRIBUTING TO CLEAN WATER \n\nOur forests are critical for providing clean water to communities in our watersheds. The trees, plants and soil absorb rain and snowmelt, allowing our forests to capture and slowly release clean water into the many streams, rivers and groundwater systems on our lands. Our sustainable forestry practices help us maintain our forests' ability to capture and filter water, ensuring our harvesting methods safeguard water quality for people, fish and countless other organisms. Because our forests rely on rainwater to grow, our company&#8217;s measurable impact on water use is limited to our Wood Products manufacturing sites and offices, where water is either recycled or treated on-site, evaporated while products are drying or delivered to a local, publicly-owned treatment facility. \n\nMINIMIZING WASTE \n\nOn average, 95 percent of each log that enters our mills is turned into a useful product. The primary products we produce are solid lumber, wood panels and engineered wood products. Wood shavings, sawdust, chips and bark are sold or delivered to downstream customers who make other useful and essential products for society. Toilet paper, diapers, paper, cartons, boxes, bags, landscaping mulch and wood pellets are just a few of the countless products made from our wood fiber and forest and mill by-products. We are always looking for ways to reduce the amount of waste we generate, including finding responsible methods for reuse and recycling. On average, we reuse, recycle or repurpose 99 percent of potential waste in our operations. That is equal to approximately 12 billion pounds of material each year that otherwise would have found its way to a landfill. \n\nVERIFYING WITH CERTIFICATION \n\nTo prove our forest management and wood fiber procurement practices are sustainable, we participate in independent certification programs for forest management, fiber sourcing and chain of custody. Our entire timberland portfolio is certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative &#174; (SFI) Forest Management Standard. That compares with only 11 percent of the world's forests that are certified today (the vast majority of these certified forests are in the Northern Hemisphere). Internationally recognized forest certification standards, such as SFI, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC TM ), the American Tree Farm System &#174; (ATFS), and the Forest Stewardship Council &#174; , provide customers and stakeholders with an objective, third-party determination of whether companies are implementing sustainable forestry practices and making products that come from legal and well-managed sources. We are vocal supporters of the importance of these standards and the use of independent, third-party audits to verify compliance and promote sustainable forestry around the world. At Weyerhaeuser, we choose to certify our timberlands and operations to SFI&#8217;s standards because they are strong, science-based standards that have effectively pushed forestry in a more sustainable direction. These standards are designed specifically for operations in North America, and we value SFI&#8217;s collaborative approach, especially around logger training and the requirement to invest in and apply research back into our operations. In addition to our forests, we certify all of our manufacturing facilities to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard, and select sites are certified to the SFI and PEFC Chain of Custody standards. \n\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY \n\nThroughout our long history, social responsibility has been an integral part of how we do business. Our company needs diverse, talented workers to grow, innovate and thrive with us for decades to come. Because we depend so much on our people, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to create a safe, inclusive work environment where employees are proud to spend their entire careers. We also need strong communities around us, filled with people who trust and support our work. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 4 \n\n&#160; \n\nOUR PEOPLE BY THE NUMBERS \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed 9,264 employees, including 7,906 in the United States, 1,347 in Canada, and 11 in Japan. Of these employees, 2,366 are members of unions covered by multi-year collective-bargaining agreements. \n\nOur employees by business segment were as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START SEGMENT \n\nNUMBER OF EMPLOYEES \n\nTimberlands \n\n1,276 \n\nReal Estate &#38; ENR \n\nWood Products \n\n7,145 \n\nCorporate \n\nTotal \n\n9,264 \n\n##TABLE_END SAFETY \n\nSafety is a core value at Weyerhaeuser, which means safety comes first in everything we do. We are deeply committed to eliminating serious and fatal injuries, and to ultimately achieving an injury-free workplace. Our industry-leading safety results are driven by: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ncaring leadership with a safety-focused &#8220;tone at the top&#8221;; \n\n&#61623; \n\nrobust safety policies and practices; \n\n&#61623; \n\nengaged employees with regular safety training and education and \n\n&#61623; \n\na strong company-wide focus on identifying and reducing hazards and risks. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe regularly review safety incidents, risk-identification reports and &#8220;near-miss&#8221; incidents and apply key learnings across our organization. Our efforts have resulted in a significant and sustained reduction in the number and severity of recordable injuries. This includes a drop in our Recordable Incident Rate, which is the number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration-defined recordable injuries and illnesses that occur per 100 workers working in one year, from 10 in 1990 to 1.62 in 2022. \n\nPEOPLE DEVELOPMENT \n\nDeveloping people is a core component of our sustainable business model, and we focus a great deal of energy and resources on training, coaching and career planning. We also connect key human capital management priorities, such as succession planning, leadership development and critical role placement, with our executive compensation programs by including these and related priorities in our senior executives&#8217; annual cash bonus plan goals. To support our people development objectives we: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\npartner with our employees on individual development plans and provide a wide range of individual development tools; \n\n&#61623; \n\nannually enroll hundreds of our front-line, mid-level and executive leaders (future and current) in development programs; \n\n&#61623; \n\nengage in rigorous internal talent assessment and succession planning and \n\n&#61623; \n\nmonitor and regularly review our strategies and action plans to address any workforce gaps in our organization, including gender, race and other underrepresented groups. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe also believe in the 70-20-10 approach to professional growth. This model acknowledges that at least 70 percent of development occurs on the job through direct experience and skill building. Another 20 percent comes from focused relationship building and exposure to projects, processes and perspectives outside one&#8217;s normal expertise. The final 10 percent is focused on targeted training courses and development programs that help our employees achieve their own specific career goals. We offer three classroom-based leadership development programs that focus on helping current and future leaders build their skills. In 2022, about 275 of our leaders participated in these programs. In addition, we expanded our online training offerings, which are accessible to all employees to take in support of their career development, and we offered a variety of virtually facilitated trainings on a range of topics to multiple teams. In 2022, our employees logged over 38,400 hours of training in our online learning management system, which tracks both virtual and classroom courses delivered. \n\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION \n\nInclusion is a core value at Weyerhaeuser. Our senior management team and board of directors regularly review our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and goals, which are focused on creating an inclusive environment, ensuring our policies and practices are equitable, and improving representation where we have gaps. To achieve this, we are focused on three key areas: leadership, people and culture. We have in place an Inclusion Council of 25 diverse employees from across our company and a dedicated director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&#38;I) who works with our leaders to set annual goals, review our progress and adjust our approach to meet evolving best practices. The Council and our DE&#38;I director provide insights and ideas to our senior management team, and they are actively engaged in helping us build an inclusive culture at all levels of the company. Our practices for achieving and maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\n&#8220;no tolerance&#8221; policies regarding discrimination and harassment of employees, suppliers, customers and visitors; \n\n&#61623; \n\nrecurrent reviews of pay equity and addressing of gaps; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 5 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\npaid parental leave for all employees; \n\n&#61623; \n\nmasked names on resumes and diverse hiring teams; \n\n&#61623; \n\ntraining on unconscious bias and harassment prevention; \n\n&#61623; \n\ninclusive leadership training integrated into our development programs; \n\n&#61623; \n\nemployee-led resource groups; \n\n&#61623; \n\nongoing company-wide communication on the importance of inclusion and \n\n&#61623; \n\nregular company-wide surveys and other means of anonymously collecting candid feedback to assist us in evaluating our inclusive culture and addressing any identified gaps. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn response to feedback surveys conducted for 2022, 82 percent of all employees agreed their work environment is inclusive. We publish our Employment Information Report (EEO-1) summary data in the sustainability section of our website. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe will continue to closely monitor evolving best practices and will make adjustments to our approach as we think necessary and appropriate. \n\nCOMPANY CULTURE \n\nWe consider our strong company culture to be a competitive advantage. We are intentional in our efforts to preserve the key positives of our workplace environment, as well as continuously improve and evolve our culture. At the heart of our culture is an unwavering commitment to our core values &#8212; safety, integrity, citizenship, sustainability and inclusion. These values are cited often by our employees and are visible throughout our organization. We also embrace five key behaviors that shape our culture and guide how we work together &#8212; urgency, accountability, courage, simplicity and innovation. To assess the health of our culture, we conduct regular company-wide surveys to collect candid feedback from employees and assess overall engagement. In 2022, we conducted an engagement survey of all employees, and our response rate was 75 percent. Our overall engagement favorability score from this group was 86 percent and our average favorability score on questions about the strength of our values was 84 percent. Another indicator we monitor to assess the strength of our company culture is voluntary turnover, which was 14 percent in 2022. \n\nCOMPETITIVE PAY &#38; BENEFITS \n\nWe offer competitive compensation and benefits packages based on experience, knowledge and skill level that are designed to attract and retain talented employees and reward superior performance. Some of our benefits include paid parental leave for all employees, company match for retirement plans, comprehensive medical and dental coverage and paid time off. \n\nSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES \n\nWe operate in rural communities across North America, and we are proud to invest our time and money to help ensure they are thriving places to live and work. In 2022, we provided $5.6 million in charitable grants, in-kind donations and sponsorships in our communities, and our employees volunteered over 14,600 hours of their time to causes they care about. Through our company-wide employee giving platform, we provide an easy way for all employees to donate to charities using payroll deduction, and we offer company match programs for both employee donations and volunteerism hours. \n\nPROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION \n\nDrawing on more than a century of experience in sustainable forestry, we share our story and expertise through tours of our forests and facilities across North America, and we also operate two centers that are open to the public and provide a range of experiential opportunities to learn about forestry, ecology and environmental issues. In Washington, our Mount St. Helens Forest Learning Center is full of exhibits that tell the story of Mount St. Helens and the return of the forest through interactive, hands-on activities and visual displays. In North Carolina, our Cool Springs Environmental Education Center offers a 1,700-acre working forest and outdoor classroom for visitors to explore forestry working in harmony with wildlife habitat, air quality, water quality and recreational activities. \n\nSTRONG GOVERNANCE \n\nOur corporate governance practices and policies promote the long-term interests of our shareholders, strengthen the accountability of our board of directors and management and help build public trust in our company. Our governance framework is built on a foundation of written policies and guidelines that align with the principles set out in the corporate governance framework established by the Investor Stewardship Group, or ISG, for U.S.-listed companies. We modify and enhance our policies and guidelines on a continuous basis to reflect best practices and feedback from our shareholders. \n\nBOARD COMPOSITION AND INDEPENDENCE \n\nOur corporate governance guidelines and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange require that a majority of the board be comprised of independent directors. Our current board composition far exceeds this requirement, as eight of our nine directors are independent, with the one exception being our chief executive officer. Four of our board members are women, including one woman of color, and we have appointed seven new directors to our board since 2015. Our board has chosen to separate the positions of board chair and chief executive officer, which strengthens the board&#8217;s independent oversight of the company&#8217;s performance and governance standards. All of our directors stand for election annually, and we have a majority voting standard in uncontested elections. The board has regular executive sessions of independent \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 6 \n\n&#160; \n\ndirectors, and the Audit, Compensation, and Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committees are all composed solely of independent directors. \n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION \n\nOur compensation program is designed to reflect a strong pay-for-performance alignment that will result in superior financial results and create long-term value for shareholders. The Compensation Committee completes a risk assessment of the company&#8217;s compensation program on an annual basis and also reviews the program and considers feedback from shareholders to ensure that compensation is appropriately linked to performance against company strategy and is aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Some of our leading compensation practices include &#8220;double trigger&#8221; accelerated vesting of our long-term incentive equity awards upon a change in control, a &#8220;clawback&#8221; policy for recovery of incentive compensation in the event of a restatement of the financial or operating results of the company or one of our business segments, no executive perquisites other than limited relocation-related benefits and security services (when necessary), significant weighting of pay tied to performance-based compensation, significant portion of compensation in the form of equity awards with multi-year vesting, and balanced focus on both long-term strategic and financial objectives and shorter-term business objectives. \n\nSHARE OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS \n\nWe have share ownership requirements for our executive officers and directors that require each of them to hold a multiple of his or her base salary (or cash compensation) in shares of Weyerhaeuser stock. The minimum holding requirement is 6x base salary for our chief executive officer, 2x base salary for our senior vice presidents, and 5x annual cash retainer for our non-employee directors. Until the required ownership levels are achieved, executives must retain 75 percent of the net profit shares acquired when restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) vest. Net profit shares are shares remaining after payment of taxes upon vesting. A director may sell shares issuable upon vesting of RSUs only for purposes of paying the taxes due upon vesting but must otherwise hold 100 percent of the net shares granted to him or her until the ownership requirement has been satisfied. Our Compensation Committee monitors and confirms that our directors and officers are in compliance with these requirements. Additionally, we have an anti-hedging and trading policy which prohibits our directors, executive officers, and employees who report directly to our executive officers from hedging their ownership of the company&#8217;s stock. The policy also prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging company stock, engaging in any short sales of company stock or trading company stock on margin. \n\nCODE OF ETHICS \n\nIntegrity is a core value at Weyerhaeuser. We have a strong culture of ethics and integrity at every level of our company. Since our founding in 1900, we have consistently been recognized for our ethical business practices, compliance and high standards. In 2022, we were named for the 13 th time as one of the World&#8217;s Most Ethical Companies&#174; by Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. Our Code of Ethics applies to all employees and members of our board, and it is an expression of our commitment and shared responsibility to conduct our business affairs ethically with stakeholders, including employees, communities, customers, suppliers, contractors and shareholders. Our employees also participate in regular compliance and ethics training, role-model and promote ethical behavior, and are instructed on how to communicate concerns of unethical behavior. \n\nSHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT \n\nWe believe that maintaining regular and active dialogue with our shareholders is important for effective corporate governance as well as to our commitment to deliver sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders. We engage with our shareholders on a variety of topics throughout the year to ensure we are addressing questions and concerns, to seek input and to provide perspective on our policies and practices. Shareholder feedback is regularly reviewed and considered by the board and its committees and is reflected in adjustments and enhancements to our policies and practices. We remain committed to investing time with our shareholders to maintain transparency and to better understand their views on key issues. \n\nSHAREHOLDER RIGHTS \n\nShareholder Proxy Access \n\nOur company Bylaws allow eligible shareholders to nominate candidates to the board of directors who are included in the company&#8217;s proxy statement and ballot. This process for inclusion of shareholder nominees in the proxy statement is in addition to previously existing Bylaw provisions that allow shareholders to nominate directors to the board without access to the company&#8217;s proxy statement. \n\nPolicy on Shareholder Approval of Rights Plans \n\nOur board of directors maintains a shareholder rights plan policy that requires the board to obtain shareholder approval prior to adopting any shareholder rights plan. However, the board may act on its own to adopt a shareholder rights plan if a majority of the independent directors, \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nexercising their fiduciary duties under Washington law, determine that such submission to shareholders would not be in the best interests of shareholders under the circumstances. \n\nShareholders' Right to Call Meetings \n\nOur company Bylaws provide that special meetings of our shareholders may be called by shareholders representing at least 25 percent of the company&#8217;s outstanding shares if certain notice and other procedural requirements are followed and if the board determines that the matters of business to be brought before the meeting are appropriate for shareholder action under applicable law. \n\nDISCIPLINED RISK MANAGEMENT \n\nMaking the right decisions for our business requires understanding risk. We use disciplined processes to manage our risks, which include, among other areas, environmental, safety, social, legal, operational and public-policy risks so our leaders and employees can make safe and informed decisions.&#8239;Our enterprise risk management group evaluates the likelihood of various risks and determines the potential magnitude of impact to our company. The analysis is conducted under the guidance of our chief compliance officer, who reports to our senior vice president and general counsel and our Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee, with assistance from other members of the management team, and is reviewed by our board of directors. We also conduct internal audits regularly to ensure compliance with environmental, safety, financial, disclosure and other regulations; voluntary standards; and our own company policies. When noncompliance issues are identified, we develop, implement and track corrective action plans to ensure timely resolution.&#8239;An independent public accounting firm audits our accounting processes, financial reporting and internal controls on an ongoing basis.&#8239;We also focus on managing cybersecurity risk through a program that includes information security training, systems testing, testing and audit of our IT controls, and alignment of our program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (see further discussion in the Cybersecurity section below). We also maintain and regularly update other company policies that guide our business, inform our employees and help manage our identified risks, including the following: Anti-Bribery Policy; Anti-Discrimination, Anti-Harassment and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy; Chemical Management Policy; Code of Ethics; Environmental Policy; Health and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Product Stewardship Policy; Supplier Code of Ethics; Sustainable Forestry Policy; Threatened and Endangered Species Policy; and Wood Procurement Policy. \n\nCYBERSECURITY \n\nOur risk management program includes focused efforts on managing cybersecurity risk, including the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nA robust information security training program that requires all company employees with access to our networks to participate in regular and mandatory training on how to be aware of, and help defend against, cyber risks, combined with periodic testing to measure the efficacy of our training efforts. \n\n&#61623; \n\nAlignment of our program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks. \n\n&#61623; \n\nOngoing adoption of a &#8220;zero trust&#8221; cybersecurity model. \n\n&#61623; \n\nRegular and robust testing of our systems to assess our vulnerability to cyber risk, which includes targeted penetration testing, tabletop incident response exercises, periodic audits of our systems by outside industry experts and regular vulnerability scanning. \n\n&#61623; \n\nTesting and audits of our IT-related internal controls over financial reporting by our independent external auditors. \n\n&#61623; \n\nA formal vendor risk assessment process to ensure any vendors with information access have appropriate security measures and practices in place. \n\n&#61623; \n\nBusiness continuity plans and critical recovery backup systems. \n\n&#61623; \n\nInsurance for damage to property caused by a cyberattack. \n\n##TABLE_END Members of management, including our chief information officer and our chief information security officer, regularly report on the company&#8217;s cybersecurity matters to both the Audit Committee of the board of directors and the full board, which has primary oversight responsibility in this area, as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nOur cybersecurity program and risks are specifically discussed at least three times per year (including as part of our discussions regarding enterprise risk management). \n\n&#61623; \n\nOur internal audit function&#8217;s reviews of our information security programs and controls are included in quarterly reports to the Audit Committee. \n\n&#61623; \n\nCurrent information security issues that arise during the year are discussed throughout the year if potentially significant to the company and are discussed with our chairman and Audit Committee chair between board meetings as appropriate. \n\n##TABLE_END We also manage cybersecurity risk by limiting our threat landscape. For example, we do not store, transmit or process many of the types of data commonly targeted in cyberattacks, such as consumer credit card or financial information, nor do we store or maintain significant proprietary data on our systems. Moreover, our businesses do not involve or represent national infrastructure, the likes of which are common targets of cyber attackers (e.g., energy, oil &#38; gas, transportation, communications, banking and financial systems, etc.). We recognize that cyber threats are a permanent part of the risk landscape and that new threats are constantly evolving. For these and other reasons, cybersecurity is a top risk management priority at Weyerhaeuser. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 8 \n\n&#160; \n\nPARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC POLICY \n\nOur ethical and transparent involvement in public policy includes coalition and relationship building, advocacy, political contributions and grassroots activities. As active members of our communities, we participate in the political process to help shape policy and legislation affecting our company and industry and do so without regard to the private political preferences of executives. All political contributions are managed by our government affairs team. Public policy and legislative priorities are reviewed annually with senior business leaders, our board of directors and our Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. We follow both the letter and the spirit of the laws governing lobbying. Our managers receive regular training on current laws and practices, and we work fairly and honestly with public officials at all levels. Some states allow companies to contribute directly to campaigns for state and local offices and for ballot measures. We file these contributions as required at state and local levels. We also sponsor a U.S. Weyerhaeuser Political Action Committee (WPAC), which solicits voluntary contributions from eligible shareholders, employees and our board of directors. WPAC contribution reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission, and we provide a summary of our annual WPAC political donations in the sustainability section of our website. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWHAT WE DO \n\n&#160; \n\nThis section provides information about how we: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ngrow and harvest trees, \n\n&#61623; \n\nmaximize the value of every acre we own and \n\n&#61623; \n\nmanufacture and sell wood products. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor each of our business segments, we provide details about what we do, where we do it, how much we sell and where we are headed. \n\nTIMBERLANDS \n\nOur Timberlands segment manages 10.6 million acres of private commercial timberlands in the U.S. We own 9.8 million of those acres and control the remaining acres through long-term contracts. In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on 14.1 million acres of Canadian timberlands. \n\nWHAT WE DO \n\nForestry Management \n\nOur Timberlands segment: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nplants seedlings to reforest harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species (natural regeneration is employed and managed in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.); \n\n&#61623; \n\nmanages our timberlands as the trees grow to maturity; \n\n&#61623; \n\nharvests trees to be converted into wood products, such as lumber, pellets, pulp and paper; \n\n&#61623; \n\nmanages the health of our forests to sustainably maximize harvest volumes, minimize risks, and protect unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value and \n\n&#61623; \n\noffer recreational access. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe seek to maximize the returns from our timberlands by selling delivered logs and through stumpage sales to both internal and external customers. We leverage our expertise in forestry using research and planning systems to optimize log production and innovative planting and harvesting techniques across varying terrain. We use intensive, customized silviculture to increase forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis. We use our scale, infrastructure and supply chain expertise to deliver reliable and consistent supply to our customers. \n\nCompetitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to wood-consuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements. We compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of high-quality logs at scale volumes and competitive prices. Our customers also value our status as a SFI certified supplier. \n\nSustainable Forestry Practices \n\nWe manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of every acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers. At the same time, we are careful to protect biological diversity, water quality and other ecosystem values. Our working forests also provide unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value. We work hard to protect these and other qualities, while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber. We follow regulatory requirements, voluntary standards and certify 100 percent of our North American timberlands under the SFI Forest Management Standard. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 9 \n\n&#160; \n\nCanadian Forestry Operations \n\nIn Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that serve as the primary source of raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. When we harvest trees, we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government. We transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit from the harvest of timber from our licensed acres in Canada. \n\nTimberlands Products \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PRODUCTS \n\nHOW THEY&#8217;RE USED \n\nDelivered logs: \n\n&#149; Grade logs \n\n&#149; Fiber logs \n\nGrade logs are made into lumber, plywood, veneer and other products used in residential homes, commercial structures, furniture, industrial and decorative applications. Fiber logs are sold to pulp, paper and oriented strand board mills to make products used for printing, writing, packaging, homebuilding and consumer products, as well as into renewable energy and pellets. \n\nTimber \n\nStanding timber is sold to third parties through stumpage sales. \n\nRecreational leases \n\nTimberlands are leased or permitted for recreational purposes. \n\nOther products \n\nSeed and seedlings grown in the U.S. and wood chips. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nHOW WE MEASURE OUR PRODUCTS \n\nWe use multiple units of measure when transacting business including: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Thousand board feet (MBF) &#8212; used in the West to measure the expected lumber recovery from a tree or log and \n\n&#8226; Green tons (GT) &#8212; used in the South to measure weight; factors used for conversion to product volume can vary by species, size, location and season. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe report Timberlands volumes in ton equivalents. \n\nWHERE WE DO IT \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we sustainably managed timberlands in 17 states. This included owned or contracted acres in the following locations: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; 2.5 million acres in the western U.S. (Oregon and Washington); \n\n&#8226; 6.8 million acres in the southern U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia) and \n\n&#8226; 1.2 million acres in the northern U.S. (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia). \n\n&#160; \n\nIn Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities. These licenses are in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan. \n\nOur total timber inventory &#8212; including timber on owned and contracted land &#8212; is approximately 589 million tons. This timber inventory does not translate into a specific amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the age, species, size and quality of the timber and will change over time as these variables adjust. \n\nWe maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system (GIS). The resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods, including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization. The GIS component is based on GIS software that is viewed as the standard in our industry. \n\nTimber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies. The data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level. \n\nWe also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington. \n\n&#160;

We sell grade and fiber logs to manufacturers that produce a diverse range of products. We also sell standing timber to third parties and lease land for recreational purposes. Most of our timberlands are strategically located to take advantage of road, logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to customers. \n\nWestern United States \n\nOur Western timberlands are well situated to serve the wood products and pulp markets in Oregon and Washington. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 29 percent of our total Western log sales volume internally. Additionally, our location on the West Coast provides access to higher-value export markets for Douglas fir and whitewood logs to Japan, China and Korea. Our largest export market is Japan, where Douglas fir is the preferred species for higher-valued post and beam homebuilding. The size and quality of our Western timberlands, coupled with their proximity to several deep-water port facilities, competitively positions us to meet the needs of Pacific Rim log markets. \n\nOur holdings are composed primarily of Douglas fir, a species highly valued for its structural strength, stiffness and appearance. Most of our lands are located on the west side of the Cascade Mountain Range with soil and rainfall conditions considered favorable for growing this species. Our standing timber inventory is comprised of 81 percent Douglas fir, 12 percent whitewood and 7 percent hardwood. \n\nOur management systems and supply chain expertise provide us a competitive operating advantage in a number of areas including forestry and research, harvesting, marketing and logistics. Additionally, our scale, diversity of timberlands ownership and infrastructure on the West Coast allow us to consistently and reliably supply logs to our internal and external customers year-round. \n\nWe sell recreational use permits covering approximately 2 million acres of our owned Western timberlands. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 12 \n\n&#160; \n\n2022 Western U.S. Inventory by Species \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n2022 Western U.S. Inventory by Age / Species \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nThe average age of timber harvested from our Western timberlands in 2022 was 48 years, excluding salvage volumes. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest and replant an average of 2 percent of our Western acreage each year. \n\nSouthern United States \n\nOur Southern timberland ownership, covering 11 states, is well situated to serve domestic wood products and pulp markets, including third-party customers and our own mills. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 22 percent of our total Southern log sales volume internally. Additionally, our Atlantic and Gulf coastal locations position us to serve an emerging Asian log export market. Our standing timber inventory is comprised of 76 percent Southern yellow pine and 24 percent hardwoods. \n\nOperationally, we focus on efficiently harvesting and hauling logs from our ownership and capitalizing on our scale and supply chain expertise to consistently and reliably supply logs to our internal and external customers year-round. \n\nWe lease approximately 95 percent of our owned Southern acreage for recreational purposes. \n\n2022 Southern U.S. Inventory by Species \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 13 \n\n&#160; \n\n2022 Southern U.S. Inventory by Age / Species \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nThe average age of timber harvested from our Southern timberlands in 2022 was 29 years. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest and replant an average of 3 percent of our acreage each year in the South. \n\nNorthern United States \n\nOur Northern timberlands acres contain a diverse mix of temperate broadleaf hardwoods and mixed conifer species across timberlands located in four states. We grow over 40 species and market over 300 product grades to a diverse mix of customers. \n\nOur large-diameter cherry, red oak and hard maple sawlogs and veneer logs serve domestic and export furniture markets. Our maple and other appearance woods are used in furniture and high-value decorative applications. In addition to high-value hardwood sawlogs, our mix includes hardwood fiber logs for pulp and oriented strand board applications. Hardwood pulpwood is a significant market in the Northern region and we have long-term supply agreements, primarily at market rates, for nearly 95 percent of our hardwood pulp production. Our competitive advantages include a merchandising program to capture the value of the premium hardwood logs. \n\n2022 Northern U.S. Inventory by Species \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n2022 Northern U.S. Inventory by Age / Species \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 14 \n\n&#160; \n\nThe average age of timber harvested from our Northern timberlands in 2022 was 54 years. Timber harvested in the North is sold predominantly as delivered logs to domestic mills, including our manufacturing facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 6 percent of our total Northern log sales volume internally. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest an average of 1 percent of our acreage each year in the North. Regeneration is predominantly natural, augmented by planting where appropriate. \n\nCanada &#8212; Licensed Forestlands \n\nWe manage forestlands in Canada under long-term licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. The provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through Annual Allowable Cuts (AAC), which are updated every 10 years. As of December 31, 2022, our AAC by province was: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8226; Alberta &#8212; 2,221 thousand tons, \n\n&#8226; British Columbia &#8212; 547 thousand tons, \n\n&#8226; Ontario &#8212; 154 thousand tons and \n\n&#8226; Saskatchewan &#8212; 633 thousand tons. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhen the volume is harvested, we pay the province for that volume at stumpage rates set by the government. The harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost (stumpage plus harvest, haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties). Any profit from harvesting the log through converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our Wood Products segment. \n\nSummary of License Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTHOUSANDS OF \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nACRES AT \n\n&#160; \n\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA \n\n&#160; \n\nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTOTAL ACRES \n\n&#160; \n\nProvince: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAlberta \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,399 \n\n&#160; \n\nBritish Columbia \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,147 \n\n&#160; \n\nOntario (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,574 \n\n&#160; \n\nSaskatchewan (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,987 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Canada \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14,107 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) License is managed by partnership. \n\nHOW MUCH WE HARVEST \n\nOur fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of long-term economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets.

In 2021, we announced the launch of our new natural climate solutions business through which we intend to leverage our resources and expertise to help others meet their goals to reduce carbon emissions or mitigate environmental impacts. This involves an expansion of our current business activities in the areas of conservation and mitigation banking and leasing land for renewable energy projects. In addition, we are strategically positioned to participate in two emerging markets focused on the mitigation of carbon emissions: the forest carbon offset markets, where carbon credits are created through incremental carbon sequestration over a baseline and sold to buyers in need of offset credits, and carbon capture and storage, which involves leasing of surface and subsurface ownership to safely and permanently store transported carbon emissions from their source. As the largest private owner of timberlands in North America, the scale and geographic diversity of our assets create a unique opportunity for participation in each of these activities, all of which offer natural solutions for reducing carbon emissions and support climate change mitigation efforts. \n\nWHAT WE DO \n\nReal Estate \n\nProperties that exhibit higher use value than commercial timberlands are monetized by our Real Estate business over time. We analyze our existing U.S. timberland holdings using a process we call AVO. We start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market. The assessment includes demographics, infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland. Attributes can evolve over time, and accordingly, the assignment of value and opportunity can change. We continually revisit our AVO assessment for all our timberland acres. Recently, we have been focused on developing a next-generation process that enhances our ability to identify and capture value from various timber and non-timber attributes, including carbon, renewable energy and other natural climate solutions opportunities. This sophisticated technology-enabled approach, referred to as &#8220;AVO 2.0&#8221;, leverages remote sensing, satellite imagery, machine learning and other advanced data analytics, and has generated significant improvements in our ability to identify strategic growth opportunities and manage every acre in our portfolio to maximize value across the full suite of attributes and opportunities. \n\nWe expect to sell certain properties for recreational, conservation, commercial or residential purposes over time. We will also entitle a small amount of acres for real estate development. Development, outside of entitlement activities, is typically performed by third parties. Mitigation banking allows us to set aside certain areas of our timberlands to preserve, enhance or restore a wetland, stream or habitat area to make up for development by another entity in a similar nearby ecosystem. Activities within this business that contribute to natural climate solutions include conservation sales and mitigation banking. Some of our real estate activities are conducted through our TRSs. \n\nOccasionally, we sell a small amount of timberland acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands. These transactions will vary based on factors including the location and physical and operating characteristics of the timberlands. \n\nThe volume of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the ability of buyers to obtain financing, the number of competing properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales, the plans of adjacent landowners, our expectation of future price appreciation, the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and not-for-profit funding. In any period, the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold. \n\nEnergy and Natural Resources \n\nWe focus on maximizing potential opportunities for construction materials, industrial minerals, renewable energy (including wind and solar energy), natural gas, rights of way easements on our timberland portfolio and retained mineral interests. Activities within this business that contribute to natural climate solutions include leasing land for the production of renewable energy like wind and solar, as well as forest carbon and carbon capture and storage. \n\nAs the owner of mineral rights and interests, we typically do not invest in development or operations but, instead, enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore, develop and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties. We generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage. Some Energy and Natural Resources activities are conducted through our TRSs. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 19 \n\n&#160; \n\nReal Estate, Energy and Natural Resources Sources of Revenue \n\n&#160;

We also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality, including the protection of wildlife and water quality. Changes in law and regulation, or certification standards, can significantly affect our business. \n\nREGULATIONS AFFECTIN G FORESTRY PRACTICES \n\nIn the United States, regulations established by federal, state and local government agencies to protect, among other things, water quality, wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands. Forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nlimits on the size of clearcuts, \n\n&#61623; \n\nrequirements that some timber be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat, \n\n&#61623; \n\nregulations regarding construction and maintenance of forest roads, \n\n&#61623; \n\nrules requiring reforestation following timber harvest, \n\n&#61623; \n\nregulations on the use of pesticides and herbicides and \n\n&#61623; \n\nvarious related permit programs. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nEach state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices and regulations to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve water quality standards, protect fish and wildlife habitats, human health, or achieve other public policy objectives. \n\nIn Canada, our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces. All forest operations in Canada are subject to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nforest practices and environmental regulations and \n\n&#61623; \n\nlicense requirements established by contract between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental values and encourage other stewardship values. \n\n##TABLE_END In Canada, 21 member companies of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), including Weyerhaeuser &#8217; s Canadian subsidiary, announced in May 2010 the signing of a Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA) with nine environmental organizations. The CBFA applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to FPAC members and, when fully implemented, was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of Canada &#8217; s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk, in particular, woodland caribou. While the CBFA mandate came to an end in 2017, CBFA signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of indigenous and local communities in advancing the goals of the CBFA. \n\nENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS \n\nIn the United States, a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws, including but not limited to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nthe northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest; \n\n&#61623; \n\nseveral freshwater mussel and sturgeon species and \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, dusky gopher frog, American burying beetle and Northern long-eared bat in the South or Southeast. \n\n##TABLE_END Additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies. In addition, significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate &#34;critical habitat&#34; for ESA-listed species, and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time. Such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options. Restrictions on timber harvests can result from: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nfederal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species; \n\n&#61623; \n\nregulatory actions by federal or state agencies to protect these species and their habitat and \n\n&#61623; \n\ncitizen suits under the ESA. \n\n##TABLE_END Such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general. To date, we do not believe that these measures have had, and we do not believe that in 2023 they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of U.S. competitors. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 26 \n\n&#160; \n\nIn Canada: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nThe federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for their critical habitat. Pursuant to SARA, Environment Canada continues to identify and assess species deemed to be at risk and their critical habitat. \n\n&#61623; \n\nIn October 2012, the Canadian Minister of the Environment released a strategy for the recovery of the boreal population of woodland caribou under the SARA. The population and distribution objectives for boreal caribou across Canada are to (1) maintain the current status of existing, self-sustaining local caribou populations and (2) stabilize and achieve self-sustaining status for non-self-sustaining local caribou populations. Critical habitat for boreal caribou is identified for all boreal caribou ranges, except for northern Saskatchewan&#8217;s Boreal Shield range (SK1) where additional information is required for that population. Species assessment and recovery plans are developed in consultation with indigenous communities and stakeholders. \n\n&#61623; \n\nIn 2017, the provinces were required to update the federal government on any progress associated with their draft caribou range plans. The majority of these plans are now being developed under Species at Risk Conservation agreements, signed between the provinces and the Federal Ministry. These agreements set out goals, objectives and timelines for caribou management. \n\n##TABLE_END The identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may, over time, result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in Canada. To date, we do not believe that these Canadian measures have had, and we do not believe that in 2023 they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of Canadian competitors. \n\nFOREST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS \n\nWe operate in North America under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative &#174; (SFI). This is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values. SFI is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nconservation organizations, \n\n&#61623; \n\nacademia, \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe forest industry and \n\n&#61623; \n\nlarge and small forest landowners. \n\n##TABLE_END Ongoing compliance with SFI may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas. There is also competition from other private certification systems, primarily the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system. Certain features of the FSC system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management. Because of the considerable variation in FSC standards, and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied, if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to these or other non-SFI standards, we could incur substantial additional costs for operations or need to reduce harvest levels in order to comply with such standards. \n\nWHAT THESE REGULATIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS MEAN TO US \n\nThe regulatory and non-regulatory forest management programs described above have: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nincreased our operating costs; \n\n&#61623; \n\nresulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands; \n\n&#61623; \n\ncontributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand; \n\n&#61623; \n\nsometimes made it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances and \n\n&#61623; \n\npotentially encouraged further reductions in the use of, or substitution of other products for, lumber, oriented strand board, engineered \n\nwood products and plywood. \n\n##TABLE_END We believe that these regulations and programs have not had, and in 2023 will not have, a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the United States or Canada. However, these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. We also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods. \n\nCANADIAN INDIGENOUS RIGHTS \n\nMany of the Canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of indigenous peoples of Canada. Most of British Columbia (B.C.) is not covered by treaties, and as a result the claims of B.C.&#8217;s indigenous peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot&#8217;in Nation holds indigenous title to approximately 1,900 square kilometers in B.C., the first time the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by indigenous peoples. Many indigenous groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of B.C., other provinces and Canada. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 27 \n\n&#160; \n\nFinal or interim resolution of claims brought by indigenous groups can be expected to result in: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nadditional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber, \n\n&#61623; \n\npotential increase in operating costs and \n\n&#61623; \n\neffect on timber supply and prices in Canada. \n\n##TABLE_END We believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2023, although they may have such an effect in the future. \n\nPOLLUTION CONTROL REGULATIONS \n\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local pollution control laws and regulations. \n\nThese laws and regulations, as well as market demands, impose controls with regard to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nair, water and land; \n\n&#61623; \n\nsolid and hazardous waste management; \n\n&#61623; \n\nwaste disposal; \n\n&#61623; \n\nremediation of contaminated sites and \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe chemical content of some of our products. \n\n##TABLE_END Compliance with these laws, regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws, regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects. \n\nOur capital projects typically are designed to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nenhance safety; \n\n&#61623; \n\nextend the life of a facility; \n\n&#61623; \n\nlower costs and improve efficiency; \n\n&#61623; \n\nimprove reliability; \n\n&#61623; \n\nincrease capacity; \n\n&#61623; \n\nfacilitate raw material changes and handling requirements; \n\n&#61623; \n\nincrease the economic value of assets or products and \n\n&#61623; \n\ncomply with regulatory standards. \n\n##TABLE_END ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP \n\nWe are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites. Of these sites: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nwe may have the sole obligation to remediate; \n\n&#61623; \n\nwe may share that obligation with one or more parties; \n\n&#61623; \n\nseveral parties may have joint and several obligations to remediate and \n\n&#61623; \n\nwe may have been named as a potentially responsible party for contaminated sites, including those designated as U.S. Superfund sites. \n\n##TABLE_END Our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial. The amount of liability depends on the: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nquantity, toxicity and nature of materials at the site and \n\n&#61623; \n\nnumber and economic viability of the other responsible parties. \n\n##TABLE_END We spent approximately $5 million in 2022 and expect to spend approximately $5 million in 2023 on environmental remediation of these sites. \n\nIt is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ndetermine it is probable that such an obligation exists and \n\n&#61623; \n\ncan reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation. \n\n##TABLE_END Based on currently available information and analysis, we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of $64 million by up to $134 million. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue. The estimate of the upper range also relies on assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 28 \n\n&#160; \n\nREGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN THE U.S. \n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations for air emissions from: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nwood products facilities and \n\n&#61623; \n\nindustrial boilers. \n\n##TABLE_END These regulations cover: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nhazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) and \n\n&#61623; \n\ncontrols and/or monitoring for pollutants that contribute to smog, haze and more recently, greenhouse gases (GHG). \n\n##TABLE_END The EPA has issued several rules relating to MACT standards and GHG emissions from various energy-producing sources. Several court decisions have made the extent of applicability of these rules uncertain. Depending on the final outcomes of these decisions, these regulatory programs could affect our operations by increasing the cost of purchasing electricity or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate. The EPA is also expected to issue rules relating to biomass emissions, which is a significant source of energy at our mills. The effect of these existing and future emissions regulations, as well as related court decisions, on our operations remains uncertain. We continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory developments but are not able to predict whether the regulations, when complete and implemented, will have a material effect on our operations. To address concerns about GHG as a pollutant, we closely monitor legislative, regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change. For more information about the substantial progress we have made in reducing our GHG emissions, see our discussion in Improving Air Quality in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Practices &#8211; Environmental Stewardship section of this report. \n\nAdditional factors that could affect regulation of GHG emissions in the future include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\npolicy proposals by federal or state governments regarding regulation of GHG emissions, \n\n&#61623; \n\nCongressional legislation regulating or taxing GHG emissions within the next several years and \n\n&#61623; \n\nestablishment of a multistate or federal GHG emissions reduction trading system with potentially significant implications for all U.S. businesses. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe believe these developments have not had, and in 2023 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from physical climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not currently anticipate any near-term disruptions to our planned operations. \n\nREGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN CANADA \n\nOur wood products facilities are regulated in Canada under provincial air quality rules. The Canadian federal government has also proposed an air quality management system (AQMS) as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada to go along with existing provincial air quality regulations. The AQMS includes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nambient air quality standards for outdoor air quality management across the country; \n\n&#61623; \n\na framework for air zone air management within provinces and territories that targets specific sources of air emissions; \n\n&#61623; \n\nregional airsheds that facilitate coordinated action across borders; \n\n&#61623; \n\nindustrial sector-based emission requirements that set a national base level of performance for major industries in Canada and \n\n&#61623; \n\nimproved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn addition to these existing and proposed regulations, Environment and Climate Change Canada, a Canadian federal agency, released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, a &#34;Greenhouse Gas Emission Framework.&#34; The framework put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries, including ours. \n\nAll Canadian provincial governments: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nhave greenhouse gas reporting requirements; \n\n&#61623; \n\nare working on reduction strategies and \n\n&#61623; \n\ntogether with the Canadian federal government, are considering new or revised emission standards. \n\n##TABLE_END Along with clean air regulations, British Columbia, a province in which we operate, has adopted a carbon tax and Alberta, where we also have operations, has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation. \n\nAlthough these and related regulations and measures have not had, and we do not expect in 2023 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 29 \n\n&#160; \n\nREGULATION OF WATER IN THE U.S. \n\nOur operations are regulated under the Clean Water Act, which regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the U.S. This generally means obtaining permits for certain of our silviculture activities and our operating facilities and abiding by applicable restrictions. Federal agency rulemaking and related litigation under the act affects the definition of waterways subject to the act&#8217;s regulation. This, in turn, has increased the number of required federal and state permits in some areas of our operations as it relates to the application of pesticides and herbicides on timberlands, which has increased operating costs. \n\nState governments in the U.S. continue to promulgate total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or EPA water quality standards. State TMDL requirements may set: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nlimits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water; or \n\n&#61623; \n\nadditional requirements, such as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nMoreover, some states, including at least two in which we operate, have adopted or have introduced legislation to adopt human-health-based water quality standards. These requirements may alter or introduce restrictions on some of our silviculture activities, notably the application of pesticides and herbicides to our timberlands in some areas. In Canada, various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use, quality and management. Recent areas of focus include water allocation, regional watershed protection, protection of drinking water, water pricing and a national water quality index. \n\nPending and future federal and state rulemaking, and judicial challenges thereto, could make application of the Clean Water Act, as well as comparable state laws, more or less costly to Weyerhaeuser, and we are not able to predict the final resolution of these matters. Although this and related regulations have not had, and we do not expect in 2023 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future. \n\nREGULATION OF WATER IN CANADA \n\nChanges to the Canadian Federal Fisheries Act have moved the focus of that legislation from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties. We expect further changes to these regulations, but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect, if any, on our operations. Although this and related Canadian regulations have not had, and we do not expect in 2023 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThis report contains statements concerning our future results and performance that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business, our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flows and the price of our common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY \n\n&#160; \n\nMARKET AND OTHER EXTERNAL RISKS \n\nThe industries in which we operate are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and consequently are highly cyclical. \n\nThe overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture and distribute reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which consequently affect our sales and profitability. End-user demand depends in large part on general macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as on local economic conditions. The length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time, both by market and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volumes and reduced margins for our products. \n\nLow demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling can adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur business is particularly dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market, and specifically on demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling. Demand in these markets is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. Other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling, and hence demand for our products, include factors such as changes in consumer preferences, limited wage growth, increases in non-mortgage consumer debt, any weakening in consumer confidence, as well as any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses. \n\nCatastrophic events may adversely affect the markets for our products and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to the risk of various catastrophic events, including but not limited to the occurrence of significant fires or wide-spread insect or pest infestations on one or more of our properties, severe regional or local weather events or trends, flooding, major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, significant geopolitical conditions or developments such as significant international trade disputes, terrorist attacks, armed conflict, domestic or foreign political unrest and regional health epidemics or global health pandemics. Any one or more of these events or conditions, or other catastrophic events or developments, could significantly affect our ability to operate our businesses and adversely affect domestic and foreign general economic conditions and thus domestic or foreign market demand for our products. \n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) a global pandemic. In response, federal, state and local governments in the United States, as well as governments throughout the world, declared states of emergency and ordered preventative measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. These measures, which included stay-at-home and similar mandates for individuals and closure or significant curtailment of many businesses, adversely affected our and our contractors&#8217; ability to operate, significantly disrupted our supply chain and caused significant economic disruption and uncertainty, including increases in unemployment, elevated inflation and volatility in global capital markets. The extent to which COVID-19 or other disease outbreaks may further affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as our plans and decisions relating to various capital expenditures, other discretionary items and capital allocation priorities, including the timing and amount of our dividends to shareholders, are therefore highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with confidence. Such developments include, but are not limited to: the future rate of occurrence or further mutation of COVID-19 or the occurrence of another virulent disease outbreak; governmental response to and duration of disease outbreak and consequential restrictions and business disruptions; the effectiveness of responsive government actions to contain and manage disease outbreak; and the timing and effectiveness of treatment and testing options, including the ongoing efficacy and availability of necessary vaccines. \n\nThe impact of COVID-19 or occurrence of other virulent disease outbreak may also trigger the occurrence, or exacerbate, other risks discussed herein, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nHomebuyers&#8217; ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates, changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market. \n\nAccess to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the U.S. housing market. Generally, increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing, which could negatively affect demand for housing and, in turn, negatively affect demand for our wood products. After maintaining interest rates at historically low levels for an extended period of time, in the first quarter of 2022 the U.S. Federal Reserve began implementing a policy of incrementally raising rates. We cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. Federal Reserve's current policy will be maintained or the timing, number, extent or direction of future rate adjustments. \n\nAlong with prevailing interest rates, other significant factors affecting the demand for new homes relate to the ability of home buyers to obtain mortgage financing. During the last U.S. recession, credit requirements for home lending were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were thereby severely reduced. Although the availability of credit has improved since that time, the housing market could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason. \n\nAdditionally, the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, has been critical to the home lending market. Any political or other developments \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 32 \n\n&#160; \n\nthat would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing. Whether resulting from further direct increases in borrowing rates, tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry, a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our products. \n\nChanges in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings. \n\nSignificant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual&#8217;s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Recent federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct. These and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments, may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products. \n\nPRODUCT PRICING AND PROFITABILITY \n\nOur profitability is affected by market dynamics outside of our control. \n\nBecause commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based largely on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are also affected by many other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have little influence or control over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile in our industry. Moreover, our profit margins with respect to these products depend, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material, labor (including contract labor) and energy costs, which represent significant cost components that also fluctuate based upon market and other factors beyond our control. \n\nExcess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins. \n\nProducers in our industry have in the past put downward pressure on product pricing by selling excess supply into the market. Our industry may increase harvest levels, which could lead to an oversupply of logs. Wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity, which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products. Any such increases of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins. \n\nTHIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS \n\nWe depend heavily on third parties for logging and transportation services, and any increase in the cost or any disruption in the availability of these services could materially adversely affect our business and operations and our financial results. \n\nOur businesses depend heavily on the availability of third-party service providers for the harvest of our timber and the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber. We are therefore considerably affected by the availability and cost of these services. Any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers, including without limitation an increase in the cost of fuel or labor, could have a material negative effect on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us, as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether. \n\nOur third-party transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure, labor issues including shortages of commercial truck drivers, and natural disasters. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to timely deliver our products, including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills, could harm our supply chain, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our reputation. \n\nAs a result of weak business conditions in the timber industry that persisted for several years, there are fewer third-party service providers in certain markets to harvest and deliver our logs. This shortage has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and, in some cases, compromised the general availability of these contractors. Any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of third-party logging and hauling service providers. This, in turn, could increase the cost of log supply and delivery, or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market. \n\nMANAGING COMMERCIAL TIMBERLANDS RISKS \n\nOur ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur primary assets are our timberlands. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations, and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands. Other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect or pest infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, severe weather and other natural disasters. As discussed in more detail in the following risk factors, changes in global climate conditions could intensify the severity and rate of occurrence of any one or more of these risks that we currently face or introduce other risks that we currently cannot predict. Although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 33 \n\n&#160; \n\ntimberlands will in fact be limited. As is common in the forest products industry, we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands. Our revenues, net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels. Therefore, if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time, or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur, we could suffer materially adverse effects to our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nFuture timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas, which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires, pests, insects and other hazards, regulatory constraints, availability of contractors, U.S. immigration policies and other factors beyond our control. \n\nTimber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish, wildlife, water and other resources. Regulations, government agency policy and guidelines, and litigation, can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs. Examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened, endangered and &#8220;at-risk&#8221; species, harvesting and forestry road building activities that may be restricted under the U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, state forestry practices laws, laws protecting aboriginal rights, and other similar regulations. \n\nOur estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates, which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues. \n\nWhether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions, we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories. These include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested, timber growth rates and end-product yields. Timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property. These estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests, revenues and expected cash flows. While the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer them, future growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain and subject to many external variables that could further affect their accuracy. These external variables include, among other things, disease, insect or pest infestation, natural disasters and changes in weather patterns. If these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised, which may cause our results of operations, cash flows and our stock price to be adversely affected. \n\nOur operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber. \n\nA variety of factors affect prices for timber, including available supply, changes in economic conditions that affect demand, the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and insect or pest infestation, and other factors. These factors vary by region, by timber type (i.e., sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and by species. \n\nTimber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local, national and international level. The closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region, and therefore pricing. For example, as the demand for paper continues to decline, closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips. Additionally, some of our Asian log export markets, particularly China, have a history of significant volatility. Lower demand for our export logs could have a negative effect on timber prices, particularly in the western region. \n\nTimber prices are also affected by changes in timber supply and availability at the local, national and international level. Our timberland ownership is concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington. In some of these states, much of the timberland is privately owned. Increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands owned by others and not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that moderates such price increases. In western states such as Oregon and Washington, where a greater proportion of timberland is government-owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned land could significantly reduce timber prices. On a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as insect or pest infestations, fires or other natural disasters. Demand for timber in foreign markets can fluctuate due to a variety of factors as well, including but not limited to: changes in the fundamental economic conditions that affect demand for logs in a given export market country or region; any substantial increase in supply of logs from local or regional sources, including such sources that periodically supply large amounts of salvage timber as a result of disease or infestation, and other factors. \n\nTimberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio and we are therefore subject to real estate investment risks. \n\nOur real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future. As the owner and manager of approximately 11 million acres of timberlands, we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments. A downturn in the real estate industry generally, or the timber or forest products industries specifically, could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products, as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices. These risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 34 \n\n&#160; \n\nMANUFACTURING AND SELLING WOOD PRODUCTS RISKS \n\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nunscheduled maintenance outages; \n\n&#61623; \n\nprolonged power failures; \n\n&#61623; \n\nequipment failure; \n\n&#61623; \n\nchemical spill or release; \n\n&#61623; \n\nexplosion of a boiler; \n\n&#61623; \n\nfires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions or catastrophes, affecting the production of goods or the supply of raw materials (including fiber); \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe effect of drought or reduced rainfall on water supply; \n\n&#61623; \n\nlabor difficulties; \n\n&#61623; \n\ndisruptions in transportation or transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rail, tunnels, shipping and port facilities; \n\n&#61623; \n\nterrorism or threats of terrorism; \n\n&#61623; \n\ncyberattack; \n\n&#61623; \n\ngovernmental regulations; \n\n&#61623; \n\nother operational problems and \n\n&#61623; \n\neffects of viral or disease outbreaks and any resulting epidemic or global pandemic. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage. If one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Additionally, we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, other severe weather conditions, equipment failures and boiler explosions. Such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages. \n\nSome of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials. \n\nOur products compete with non-fiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. If use of these or other alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected. \n\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing. \n\nOur results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing. Some of our wood products, such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board, are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. If pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higher-priced, higher-value products, or if we are not successful in implementing price increases, or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higher-priced products, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins. \n\nWe face intense competition in our markets; any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe compete with North American producers and, for some of our product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do. The principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price. Our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nCompetition from lumber imports could vary significantly and have a material effect on U.S. lumber and timber prices. \n\nThe future amount and pricing of lumber imports entering U.S. markets remain uncertain. Historically, Canada has been the most significant source of lumber for the U.S. market, particularly in the new home construction market. We produce lumber in our Canadian mills, but the bulk of our lumber production is in the U.S. There have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between Canada and the U.S. The last agreement, which required Canadian softwood lumber facilities, including our mills, to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price, expired in October 2015. Since that time, the U.S. Department of Commerce has issued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber imports from Canada based on findings of injury to U.S. lumber producers. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 35 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are not able to predict when, or if, a new softwood lumber agreement will be reached or, if reached, what the terms of the agreement would be. Similarly, we are not able to predict if the current U.S. policy of imposing import duties on Canadian softwood lumber will continue. We could, therefore, experience significant downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by Canadian lumber imports. \n\nCustomer demand for certain brands of sustainably-produced products could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects. \n\nWe have adopted the Sustainable Forestry Initiative&#174; (SFI) &#174; standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities, both from our timberlands and from third-party suppliers. If customer preference for a sustainability standard other than SFI increases, or if the SFI standard falls into disfavor , there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards. If we seek to comply with such other standards, we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations, such as reducing harvest levels. FSC, in particular, employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands, most notably in the Pacific Northwest. \n\nOur business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy. \n\nWe rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements, cost-reduction programs or hedging arrangements. The U.S. has experienced significant inflation, which could continue or worsen and therefore negatively affect the cost or availability of raw materials and energy, which we may not be able to fully pass onto our customers. \n\nPHYSICAL RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE \n\nChanges in global or regional climate conditions could significantly harm our timberland assets and have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow and profitability of our operations. \n\nClimate change has the potential to cause significant disruptions to our business and results of operations, cash flow and profitability. There is increasing concern that increases in global average temperatures caused by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns, including changes to precipitation patterns and growing seasons. These changes could, in the long term and in some locations, lead to slower growth of our trees and, potentially, changes to the species mix that we manage in our timber assets. An increase in global temperature could also lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Thus, damage or access to our timberland assets by existing causes, such as fire, insect or pest infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, windstorms and other natural disasters, could be significantly worsened by climate change. Any one or more of these negative effects on commercial timberland operations from climate change, both our own and that of other commercial timberland operators, could also have a material adverse impact on our Wood Products business by significantly affecting the availability, cost and quality of the wood fiber used in our mill operations. \n\nWORKFORCE RISK \n\nOur business is dependent upon attracting, retaining and developing key personnel. \n\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract, retain and develop senior management, operations management and other key personnel. Our financial condition or results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit, retain, and develop such personnel, or if there were to occur any significant decrease in the availability of such personnel or any significant increase in the cost of providing such personnel with competitive total compensation and benefits. For the last few years, we have experienced a competitive and challenging labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, whether caused by any singular event such as the global pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased labor costs such as an increased need for overtime work by current employees to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. Further, if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, our operations could be disrupted. \n\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, a significant number of employees in our Western Timberlands and Wood Products businesses were covered by collective bargaining agreements. As discussed in our MD&#38;A, Weyerhaeuser employee members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union commenced a work stoppage in September 2022 affecting the company&#8217;s operations in Washington and Oregon, which was subsequently resolved in October 2022. The stoppage involved approximately 1,200 employees, affected our Wood Products and Timberlands operations and had a negative impact on our operations for the third and fourth quarter of 2022. If these workers were to engage in a protracted strike or other work stoppage, or if our non-unionized operations were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A significant customer, transportation provider or supplier strike or other work stoppage could also have similar effects on us. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 36 \n\n&#160; \n\nPENSION PLAN LIABILITY RISK \n\nVolatility in interest rates and lower than expected returns on our pension assets could reduce the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans. \n\nA portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans. Although the plans are not open to employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, current employees hired before that time continue to accrue benefits. Requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations. Fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements. It is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time. We cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future, or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions. See Note 9: Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans for additional information about these plans, including funding status. \n\nSTRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND EXECUTION RISK \n\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives. \n\nOur strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value. These initiatives include, among others, optimizing cash flow through operational excellence, reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure, innovating in higher-margin products and pursuing opportunities in emerging markets such as our recently announced initiative to participate in markets for carbon offsets and carbon storage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement any one or more of our important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. \n\nWe may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy. \n\nWe intend to strategically pursue acquisitions and strategic divestitures when market conditions warrant. As with any investment, our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. In addition, we anticipate financing such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from strategic asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all, could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute strategic acquisitions and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK \n\nWe will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. \n\nWe have manufacturing operations in Canada. We are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly relative to the Canadian dollar, euro, yuan and yen, and the strength of the euro relative to the yen. Changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volumes, margins and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKS \n\n&#160; \n\nENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS \n\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of, or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations. \n\nWe are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nair emissions, \n\n&#61623; \n\nwastewater discharges, \n\n&#61623; \n\nharvesting, \n\n&#61623; \n\nsilvicultural activities, including use of pesticides and herbicides, \n\n&#61623; \n\nforestry operations and endangered species habitat protection, \n\n&#61623; \n\nsurface water management, \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe storage, usage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe cleanup of contaminated sites, \n\n&#61623; \n\nlandfill operation and closure obligations, \n\n&#61623; \n\nbuilding codes and \n\n&#61623; \n\nhealth and safety matters. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 37 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations, and there can be no assurances that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. \n\nAs the owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our properties or operations. In addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs. \n\nWe also lease some of our properties to third-party operators for the purpose of exploring, extracting, developing and producing oil, gas, rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments. These activities are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. These operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other chemicals into the air, soil or water. Generally, these third-party operators indemnify us against any such liability, and we require that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them. However, if for any reason our third-party operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation, or if the required liability insurance were not in effect, then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with environmental liability caused by such third-party operators. \n\nAny material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition. \n\nWe also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. As discussed below, we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. These developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect homebuilding practices. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures. \n\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE \n\nGovernmental response to climate change at the international, federal and state levels may affect our results of operations, cash flows and profitability. \n\nThere continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S. and Canada, some of these proposals would regulate (and in some Canadian provinces do regulate) and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy. Climate change effects, if they occur, and governmental initiatives, laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns, could increase our costs and have a long-term adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time. \n\nHowever, climate change legislation or related government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound, greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could have significant adverse effects on our business and operations as well as our ability to achieve our recently announced business goals in emerging carbon offset and carbon storage markets. Any one or more of such new legal requirements and regulations could, for example, significantly increase the costs for our mills to comply with stricter air emissions regulations. They could also limit harvest levels for commercial timberland operators, which could in turn adversely affect our timberland operations as well as potentially lead to significant increases in the cost of energy, wood fiber and other raw materials for our wood products businesses. Any one or more of these developments, as well as other unforeseeable governmental responses to climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nLEGAL MATTERS \n\nWe are involved in various environmental, regulatory, product liability and other legal matters, disputes and proceedings that, if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. \n\nWe are, from time to time, involved in a number of legal matters, disputes and proceedings (legal matters), some of which involve ongoing litigation. These include, without limitation, legal matters involving environmental clean-up and remediation, warranty and non-warranty product liability claims, regulatory issues, contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters. In some cases, all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance; in other cases, any such losses will not be covered. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 38 \n\n&#160; \n\nThe outcome, costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved, and any related insurance recoveries, cannot be determined with certainty. Although the disclosures in Note 14: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 20: Income Taxes contain management &#8217; s current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected. It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us, and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages. Any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it. \n\nREIT STATUS AND TAX IMPLICATIONS \n\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders. \n\nIn any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the IRC: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nWe would not be allowed to deduct dividends to shareholders in computing our taxable income. \n\n&#61623; \n\nWe would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at applicable corporate rates. \n\n&#61623; \n\nWe also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the IRC to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. We closely monitor our compliance with all of the various requirements for maintaining our REIT status. For example, we regularly test our compliance with the general requirement that at least 75 percent of the market value of our total assets consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands) and certain other specified qualifying assets, and that no more than 25 percent of the market value of our total assets may consist of assets that are not REIT-qualifying assets. Although we operate in a manner consistent with these REIT qualification rules, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will remain qualified. \n\nCertain of our business activities are subject to corporate-level income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax. \n\nUnder the IRC, REITs generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate. For the company, this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber. Certain activities that generate non-qualifying REIT income could constitute &#8220;prohibited transactions.&#8221; Prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Accordingly, the harvesting and sale of logs, the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate, and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our wholly-owned TRSs, the net income of which is subject to corporate-level tax. By conducting our business in this manner, we believe that we satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the REIT constituted prohibited transactions, we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities. \n\nThe extent of our use of our TRSs may affect our REIT qualification and affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs. \n\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more TRSs. The use of our TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the harvesting and sale of logs, manufacture and sale of wood products, and the development and sale of certain higher and better use (HBU) property. Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level income tax. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs&#8217; operations. While we intend to monitor the value of our investments in the stock and securities of our TRSs to ensure compliance with the 20 percent limitation, we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to comply with the limitation so as to maintain REIT status. If we were to exceed the 20 percent limitation, we may be forced to sell or otherwise distribute assets of our TRSs in order to remain a qualified REIT. Furthermore, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs at all, or as extensively as we use them. \n\nThe failure of our subsidiary REIT to maintain its separate REIT qualification could affect the company&#8217;s own REIT qualification. \n\nA significant amount of our timberlands is held in a subsidiary that we operate to qualify as a REIT, and we may in the future invest in other timberlands and other real estate through one or more other subsidiary entities that are intended to qualify as REITs. While our ownership interest in the subsidiary REIT is a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the company&#8217;s 75 percent asset test described above, any failure of the subsidiary REIT to maintain its own separate REIT status would generally result in the subsidiary being subject to regular U.S. corporate income tax, as described above, and the company&#8217;s ownership interest in the subsidiary no longer qualifying as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75 percent asset test. If this were to occur, the company&#8217;s own REIT qualification could be affected. \n\nWe may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs. \n\nThe ability of the company to receive dividends from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income, and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 39 \n\n&#160; \n\ndividends from our TRSs and other non-real estate income. This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our TRSs may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed, and income of our TRSs that is not distributed to the company will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. \n\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT and to avoid an excise tax, we are generally required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders. \n\nGenerally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and (to avoid an excise tax) 95 percent of their net capital gains income. Capital gains may be retained by the REIT but would be subject to corporate income taxes. If capital gains were retained rather than distributed, our shareholders would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution (about which we would notify them), with a credit or refund for any federal income tax paid by the company. We believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. As previously discussed in these Risk Factors, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders. \n\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations. \n\nFederal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the United States Department of the Treasury, and state taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed. \n\nIMPORT/EXPORT TAXES AND DUTIES \n\nWe may be required to pay significant taxes or tariffs on our exported products or countervailing and anti-dumping duties or tariffs on our imported products. \n\nWe export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets, and our ability to do so profitably is affected by U.S. and foreign trade policy. International trade disputes occur frequently and can be taken to an International Trade Court for resolution of unfair trade practices between countries. \n\nU.S. international trade policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. We could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in any of our businesses that is adversely affected by international trade tariffs, duties, taxes, customs or dispute settlement terms. To the extent such trade policies increase prices, they could also reduce the demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any settlements of international trade disputes and their effect on our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nOTHER RISKS \n\n&#160; \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR STOCK \n\nOur cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. \n\nOur board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount and timing of our cash dividends to shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: our results of operations and cash flows; current and forecasted economic conditions; changes in the current or expected prices and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses; current and forecasted harvest levels; balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company&#8217;s capital requirements and debt repayment obligations; various finance considerations, including the company&#8217;s credit ratings, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations. Consequently, the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends, including our quarterly base dividend and annual supplemental dividend, may fluctuate. \n\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. \n\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results; \n\n&#61623; \n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments or initiatives; \n\n&#61623; \n\nour growth rate and our competitors&#8217; growth rates; \n\n&#61623; \n\ngeneral economic conditions; \n\n&#61623; \n\nconditions in the financial markets; \n\n&#61623; \n\nmarket interest rates and the relative yields on other financial instruments; \n\n&#61623; \n\ngeneral perceptions and expectations regarding housing markets, interest rates, commodity prices, and currencies; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 40 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock; \n\n&#61623; \n\nsales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders; \n\n&#61623; \n\nsales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock; \n\n&#61623; \n\nfluctuation in the market price of our products (see Product Pricing and Profitability above); \n\n&#61623; \n\nchanges in accounting principles and \n\n&#61623; \n\nchanges in tax laws and regulations. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies, including companies operating in the forest products industry, that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. Some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management&#8217;s attention and resources. \n\nCAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \n\nDeterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital. \n\nChallenging market conditions could impair the company &#8217; s ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other effects, reduce our ability to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. Moreover, our businesses require substantial capital for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. While we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, or at all, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. \n\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading our current rating, as well as placing the company on a &#34;watch list&#34; for possible future ratings actions. Any downgrade of our credit rating, or decision by a rating agency to place us on a &#34;watch list&#34; for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. \n\nINFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CYBERSECURITY \n\nWe face risks associated with the use of Information Technology (IT) systems including from security breaches or other significant disruptions, which could affect our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, affect our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation. \n\nWe use IT systems to carry out our operational activities, maintain our business records, and collect and store sensitive data, including but not limited to intellectual property and personally identifiable information. Some of our systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. Although we employ, and we believe our third-party service providers employ, what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures and controls, there can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective against the risks we face from cyber-attacks, including from: computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists; malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware); an intentional or unintentional personnel action; a natural disaster; a hardware or software corruption, failure or error; a telecommunications system failure; a service provider failure or error; or any one or more other causes of a security breach, failure or disruption. To date, no events of this nature have had a material adverse effect on our business. However, if in the future our IT systems are significantly disrupted, shut down or otherwise compromised, or if our data is destroyed, misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed, our financial results or our business operations, or both, could be negatively affected. Additionally, we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities, including without limitation damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals, business partners or regulators. \n\n"

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB) as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. The Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S. South has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. Our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the U.S., and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets. \n\nWhile underlying longer-term fundamentals remain favorable for construction of new housing in the U.S., home sales and building activity have slowed due in part to higher mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2022 averaged 1.4 million units, a 3.2 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. Single family starts averaged 0.9 million units, a 4.8 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. Multi-family starts averaged 541 thousand units in fourth quarter 2022, which was a 0.6 percent decrease from third quarter 2022. Sales of newly built, single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 605 thousand units for fourth quarter 2022, an increase of 4.4 percent from the prior quarter. Over the medium to long-term, we expect continued strength in the U.S. housing construction market, supported by strong demographics in the key homebuying age cohorts, a decade of underbuilding and an aging housing stock. \n\nRepair and remodeling expenditures decreased by 0.8 percent from third quarter 2022 to fourth quarter 2022 according to the Census Bureau Advance Retail Spending report. Do-it-yourself activity has been returning to more normalized levels while professionally contracted activities have benefited from larger projects and increases in home equity levels. Over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and a U.S. housing stock median age of 43 years. \n\nIn U.S. wood product markets, demand felt the effects of a slowing housing market and more uncertain economic environment over most of fourth quarter 2022. The Random Lengths Framing Lumber Composite price averaged $452/MBF and the OSB Composite averaged $360/MSF in fourth quarter 2022. Over the course of the fourth quarter, prices declined from $512/MBF to $380/MBF for lumber and from $402/MSF to $288/MSF for OSB. \n\nIn Western log markets, Douglas fir sawlog prices fell by 7.4 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared with third quarter 2022 as reported by RISI Log Lines based on Weyerhaeuser&#8217;s portfolio mix. Overall, domestic prices in the West fell moderately, as mills felt the effects of lower lumber prices, partially offset by continued constraints in log supply. In the South, delivered sawlog prices increased by 1.2 percent in fourth quarter 2022 compared to third quarter 2022 and 4.6 percent from fourth quarter 2021 as reported by Timber Mart-South, as mills are carrying higher inventories to mitigate log and haul capacity constraints. \n\nCurrency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. During fourth quarter 2022, end use demand softened in export markets, partially offset by continued disruptions in global log and lumber supply. In Japan, total housing starts increased 0.8 percent year to date through November compared to the same period in 2021, while the key Post and Beam segment saw a 4.0 percent decrease. An increase in lumber imports from Europe to Japan placed downward pressure on market conditions. China demand was held back by zero COVID-19 policies and general economic conditions, but constraints of supply sources from other countries, particularly Russia, supported demand from U.S. producers. \n\nInterest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy, and their influence on our capital management activities. Actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the overall condition of the economy, and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 6.7 percent at the end of third quarter 2022 to 6.4 percent at the end of the fourth quarter. While mortgage rates fell over the quarter and from a high of over 7 percent in November, the rapid increase in mortgage rates since the end of 2021 has had a negative impact on home affordability and reduced demand for homebuying. \n\nIncreased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. The Consumer Price Index increased 6.5 percent year over year in December 2022, primarily due to demand and supply for goods and services, fluctuations in labor markets, and monetary policy set by the U.S. Federal Reserve. While we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, our operational excellence initiatives and our procurement practices, not all of the costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer. \n\nThe condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. The unemployment rate of 3.5 percent in December 2022 remained near historically low levels and was unchanged from the end of the third quarter. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 44 \n\n&#160; \n\nLabor force participation has increased to 62.3 percent in December 2022, from 61.9 percent in December 2021, but this remains below pre-pandemic levels of over 63 percent. \n\nGovernments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration and carbon capture and storage activities. \n\nIn mid-September 2022, Weyerhaeuser employee members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union commenced a work stoppage affecting the company&#8217;s operations in Washington and Oregon. The stoppage involved approximately 1,200 employees and affected four lumber mills in our Wood Products segment and a portion of our Western Timberlands operations. This event had a negative impact on our operations for the third and fourth quarter, including reductions in fee harvest volumes and sale volumes for Western Timberlands, as well as reductions in production volumes and sales volumes for our lumber business. On October 28, 2022, the company announced the successful resolution of the work stoppage and resumed operations. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL PERFO RMANCE SUMMARY \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Sales by Segment \n\n&#160;

less than 1 percent &#8212; primarily due to a $263 million decrease in Wood Products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales volumes across most product lines and decreased realizations for structural lumber and oriented strand board. \n\nThis decrease was partially offset by a $222 million increase in Timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to increased sales realizations in the Western and Southern regions. \n\nCosts of Sales \n\nCosts of sales increased $461 million &#8212; 8 percent &#8212; primarily due to increased freight and raw material costs within our Wood Products segment, as well as increased logging and hauling costs and increased third party log purchase costs within our Timberlands segment. \n\nOperating Income \n\nOperating income decreased $563 million &#8212; 15 percent &#8212; primarily due to a $478 million decrease in consolidated gross margin (see discussion of components above). \n\nNet Earnings \n\nNet earnings decreased $727 million &#8212; 28 percent &#8212; primarily due to: \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nthe $563 million decrease in operating income discussed above; \n\n&#61623; \n\na $276 million pretax charge ($207 million after-tax) related to the early extinguishment of debt (refer to Note 12: Long-Term Debt, Net ) and \n\n&#61623;

Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies. \n\nIn accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nhistorical experience and \n\n&#61623; \n\nassumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances. \n\n##TABLE_END Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 54 \n\n&#160; \n\nOur most critical accounting policies relate to our: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ndiscount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans; \n\n&#61623; \n\npotential impairments of long-lived assets and \n\n&#61623; \n\ncontingent liabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nDetails about our other significant accounting policies &#8212; what we use and how we estimate &#8212; are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . \n\nDISCOUNT RATES FOR PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS \n\nDiscount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. These rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. The selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. These specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan. \n\nOur discount rates as of December 31, 2022 are: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\n5.4 percent for our U.S. pension plans &#8212; compared with 2.9 percent at December 31, 2021; \n\n&#61623; \n\n5.4 percent for our U.S. post-employment plans &#8212; compared with 2.6 percent at December 31, 2021; \n\n&#61623; \n\n5.3 percent for our Canadian pension plans &#8212; compared with 3.1 percent at December 31, 2021 and \n\n&#61623; \n\n5.3 percent for our Canadian post-employment plans &#8212; compared with 3.0 percent at December 31, 2021. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPension expenses for 2023 will be based on the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the U.S. pension plans and the Canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.4 percent and 5.3 percent assumed discount rates for the U.S. and Canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively. \n\nOur discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\n$10 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and \n\n&#61623; \n\n$1 million for our Canadian registered pension plans. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS \n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. \n\nIf we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. Key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales. \n\nAn impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset) . Key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes. \n\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES \n\nWe are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss. \n\nWe record contingent liabilities when: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nit becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and \n\n&#61623; \n\nthe amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nAssessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nhistorical experience, \n\n&#61623; \n\nevaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations, \n\n&#61623; \n\njudgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and \n\n&#61623; \n\nconsideration of potential environmental remediation methods. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 55 \n\n&#160; \n\nRecorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. See Note 14: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies for more information. \n\nPROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nA summary of prospective accounting pronouncements is in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPERFORMANC E MEASURES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. This measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdjusted EBITDA by Segment \n\n&#160;

      "text": " FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A ND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \n\n&#160; \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\n&#160; \n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors Weyerhaeuser Company: \n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nProjected benefit obligations for pensions \n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s projected benefit obligations for pensions were $2,278 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company estimates the liability related to their pension plans using actuarial models that include assumptions about the Company&#8217;s discount rates. \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s projected benefit obligations for pensions as a critical audit matter. This is due to the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in the discount rates used and the subjectivity in evaluating those rates. Additionally, the assessment of discount rates required specialized actuarial skills and knowledge. \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the pension obligation process. This included controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rates used in the valuation of projected benefit obligations for pensions. These procedures also included analyzing year-over-year changes to the projected cash flows associated with the obligations. Additionally, we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the Company&#8217;s discount rates by: \n\n&#8226; evaluating the selected yield curves used to determine the discount rates \n\n&#8226; assessing changes in the discount rates from the prior year against changes in published indices \n\n&#8226; evaluating the discount rates based on the projected cash flows compared with those of similar plans. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002. \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62;

\n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nour election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, \n\n&#61623; \n\nhow we report our results, \n\n&#61623; \n\nchanges in how we report our results and \n\n&#61623; \n\nhow we account for certain key items. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOUR ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT) \n\nOur company is a REIT and REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (TRSs), which include our Wood Products segment and portions of our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources (Real Estate &#38; ENR) segments. \n\nHOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS \n\nOur report includes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nconsolidated financial statements, \n\n&#61623; \n\nour business segments, \n\n&#61623; \n\nestimates, \n\n&#61623; \n\nfair value measurements and \n\n&#61623; \n\nforeign currency translation. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nConsolidated Financial Statements \n\nOur consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. They include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nmajority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and \n\n&#61623; \n\nvariable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThey do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated. \n\nThroughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , unless specified otherwise, references to &#8220;Weyerhaeuser,&#8221; &#34;the company,&#34; &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to the consolidated company. \n\nOur Business Segments \n\nReportable business segments are determined based on the company&#8217;s &#34;management approach,&#34; as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting . The management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance. \n\nWe are principally engaged in: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ngrowing and harvesting timber; \n\n&#61623; \n\nmaximizing the value of our acreage through the sale of higher and better use (HBU) properties and monetizing the value of surface and subsurface assets through leases and royalties and \n\n&#61623; \n\nmanufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOur business segments are organized based primarily on products and services. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START SEGMENT \n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES \n\nTimberlands \n\nLogs, timber, recreational leases and other products. \n\nReal Estate &#38; ENR \n\nReal Estate (sales of timberlands) and ENR (rights to explore for and extract hard minerals, construction materials, natural gas production, wind and solar). \n\nWood Products \n\nStructural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and building materials distribution. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 66 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. Because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values. \n\nUnallocated items are gains or charges not related to, or allocated to, an individual operating segment. They include all or a portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and post-employment costs, elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, interest income and other as well as legacy obligations such as environmental remediation and workers compensation. \n\nEstimates \n\nWe prepare our financial statements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). This requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. The estimates and assumptions affect our: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity; \n\n&#61623; \n\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and \n\n&#61623; \n\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWhile we do our best in preparing these estimates, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nWe use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nlong-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment; \n\n&#61623; \n\npension plan assets measured at fair value and \n\n&#61623; \n\nasset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity&#8217;s pricing based upon its own market assumptions. \n\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market. \n\n&#61623; \n\nLevel 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date. \n\n&#61623; \n\nLevel 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Currency Translation \n\nWe translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in two ways: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nassets and liabilities &#8212; at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date and \n\n&#61623; \n\nrevenues and expenses &#8212; at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nCHANGES IN HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS \n\nChanges in how we report our results come from: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nreclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and \n\n&#61623; \n\naccounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nReclassifications \n\nWe have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2022 reporting. This makes balances comparable from year to year. Our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity. \n\n&#160; \n\nHOW WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN KEY ITEMS \n\nThis section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ncapital investments, \n\n&#61623; \n\nfinancing our business and \n\n&#61623; \n\nour operations. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nITEMS RELATED TO CAPITAL INVESTMENTS \n\nKey items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands and impairment of long-lived assets. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 67 \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty and Equipment \n\nWe maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis and account for them as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nImprovements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized. \n\n&#61623; \n\nMaintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed. \n\n&#61623; \n\nDepreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives. \n\n&#61623; \n\nCosts associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year are capitalized. These roads are then amortized over an estimated service life. \n\n&#61623; \n\nCost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nTimber and Timberlands \n\nWe carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. Depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested or sold. \n\nKey activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nreforestation, \n\n&#61623; \n\ndepletion and \n\n&#61623; \n\nforest management in Canada. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nReforestation. Generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation and then expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. These expensed costs include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nfertilization, \n\n&#61623; \n\nvegetation and insect control, \n\n&#61623; \n\npruning and precommercial thinning and \n\n&#61623; \n\nproperty taxes. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nAccounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts. \n\nTimber Depletion. To determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. To determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nregulatory and environmental constraints, \n\n&#61623; \n\nour management strategies, \n\n&#61623; \n\ninventory data improvements, \n\n&#61623; \n\ngrowth rate revisions and recalibrations and \n\n&#61623; \n\nknown dispositions and inoperable acres. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber. \n\nDepletion rate calculations do not include estimates for: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nfuture silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands; \n\n&#61623; \n\nfuture reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest and \n\n&#61623; \n\nfuture volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWe include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. As these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in costs of sales. \n\nForest Management in Canada. We manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various Canadian provinces that are: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ngranted by the provincial governments; \n\n&#61623; \n\ngranted for initial periods of 15 to 25 years and \n\n&#61623; \n\nrenewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCalculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nvaries from province to province, \n\n&#61623; \n\nis tied to product market pricing and \n\n&#61623; \n\ndepends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 68 \n\n&#160; \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. Impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value, while impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value based on: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nappraisals, \n\n&#61623; \n\nmarket pricing of comparable assets, \n\n&#61623; \n\ndiscounted value of estimated future cash flows from the asset, \n\n&#61623; \n\nreplacement values of comparable assets and \n\n&#61623; \n\nagreed upon sale price or offer price. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nITEMS RELATED TO FINANCING OUR BUSINESS \n\nKey items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash equivalents and concentration of risk. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nWe estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. The assumptions we use &#8212; including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows &#8212; can significantly affect the fair value. These values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions. \n\nCash Equivalents \n\nCash equivalents are investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. We state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market. \n\nConcentration of Risk \n\nWe disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales. \n\nITEMS RELATED TO OPERATIONS \n\nKey items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefit plans and environmental remediation. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nRefer to Note 3: Revenue Recognition for details on how we account for revenue. \n\nInventories \n\nWe state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. LIFO applies to major inventory products held at our U.S. domestic locations. We began to use the LIFO method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. Subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the moving average cost or FIFO &#8212; the first-in, first-out &#8212; methods and those products continue to be recognized under those methods. The moving average cost or FIFO method applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories, all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories. \n\nShipping and Handling Costs \n\nWe classify shipping and handling costs in &#34;Costs of sales&#34; in our Consolidated Statement of Operations . \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. \n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nfuture tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and \n\n&#61623; \n\nnet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nTo measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ndetermine when the differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and \n\n&#61623; \n\nuse enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years. \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 69 \n\n&#160; \n\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans \n\nWe recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur. \n\nActuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. The net periodic benefit cost includes: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\ncost of benefits provided in exchange for employees&#8217; services rendered during the year; \n\n&#61623; \n\ninterest cost of the obligations; \n\n&#61623; \n\nexpected long-term return on plan assets; \n\n&#61623; \n\ngains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments; \n\n&#61623; \n\namortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive and \n\n&#61623; \n\namortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses &#8212; generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the combination of market-related and fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year &#8212; over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPension plans. We have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately half of our employees. Determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nSalaried employee benefits are based on each employee&#8217;s highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement. \n\n&#61623; \n\nHourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service. \n\n&#61623; \n\nUnion employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe contribute to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. The funding standards for the plans are: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nU.S. pension plans &#8212; according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and \n\n&#61623; \n\nCanadian pension plans &#8212; according to the applicable provincial pension act and the Income Tax Act. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPost-employment benefits other than pensions. We provide certain post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit. Note 9: Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans provides additional information about our post-employment benefit plans. \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimates for pension and other post-employment benefit plans. Estimates we use in accounting for our pension and other post-employment benefit plans include the: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nfair value of our plan assets; \n\n&#61623; \n\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets and \n\n&#61623; \n\ndiscount rates. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nAt the end of every year, we review our estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. We use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and post-employment expense for the following year. Actual experience that differs from our estimates and subsequent changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nFair value of plan assets. Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process. \n\nRefer to Note 9: Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans for information about the assets held within our pension plans and their related valuation methods. \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. This rate is used in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans. \n\nFactors we consider in determining our expected long-term rate of return include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nhistorical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and \n\n&#61623; \n\nexpected future performance of similar asset classes. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 70 \n\n&#160; \n\nThe actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity. \n\nDiscount rates. Discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. The discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnvironmental Remediation \n\nWe accrue losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.

We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . \n\nPERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS \n\nA performance obligation, as defined in ASC Topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied. \n\nPerformance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers&#8217; mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales. Performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. We have elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good; therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation. \n\nCustomers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. ASC Topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. Given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient. \n\nPerformance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied. \n\nCONTRACT ESTIMATES \n\nSubstantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. Therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above. \n\nThe transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period. For the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. For wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates. \n\nThere are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 72 \n\n&#160; \n\nCONTRACT BALANCES \n\nIn general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. We generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers.

For the years presented, our material related parties have consisted of variable interest entities. \n\nFrom 2002 through 2004, we sold certain nonstrategic timberlands. As a result of these sales, buyer-sponsored and monetization variable interest entities, or special purpose entities (SPEs), were formed. We were the primary beneficiary and consolidated the assets and liabilities of the SPEs involved in these transactions. \n\nThe assets of the buyer-sponsored SPEs were financial investments which consisted of bank guarantees. These bank guarantees were in turn backed by bank notes, which were the liabilities of the monetization SPEs. Interest earned from the financial investments within the buyer-sponsored SPEs was used to pay interest accrued on the corresponding monetization SPE&#8217;s note. \n\nWe had an equity interest in the monetization SPEs, but no ownership interest in the buyer-sponsored SPEs. The following disclosures refer to assets of buyer-sponsored SPEs and liabilities of monetization SPEs. However, because these SPEs were distinct legal entities: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nAssets of the SPEs were not available to satisfy our liabilities or obligations. \n\n&#61623; \n\nLiabilities of the SPEs were not our liabilities or obligations. \n\n##TABLE_END During first quarter 2020, we received $ 362 million in proceeds from our final buyer-sponsored SPE at maturity. The weighted average interest rate on our buyer-sponsored SPE was 5.5 percent during 2020. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTE 9: PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS \n\nThis note provides details about defined benefit and defined contribution plans we sponsor for our employees. The &#34;Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans&#34; section of Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies provides information about how we account for pension and other post-employment plans and benefits. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 76 \n\n&#160; \n\nDEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WE SPONSOR \n\nOVERVIEW OF PLANS \n\nThe defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the U.S. and Canada differ according to each country&#8217;s requirements. In the U.S., we have plans that qualify under the Internal Revenue Code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (nonqualified plans). In Canada, we have plans that are registered under the Income Tax Act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the Income Tax Act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). We also sponsor other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans in the U.S. and Canada, including retiree medical and life insurance plans. \n\nWe sponsor various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and Canadian salaried and hourly employees. Our contributions to these plans were $ 31 million, $ 27 million and $ 27 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nActions to Reduce Pension Plan Obligations \n\nAs part of our continued efforts to reduce pension plan obligations, we transferred approximately $ 420 million of Canadian registered assets and liabilities and approximately $ 790 million of U.S. qualified pension plan assets and liabilities to insurance companies through the purchase of group annuity contracts in December 2022 (2022 Retiree Annuity Purchase) and December 2020 (2020 Retiree Annuity Purchase), respectively. In connection with these transactions, we recorded noncash pretax settlement charges of $ 205 million and $ 253 million during 2022 and 2020, respectively. These settlement charges accelerated the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in &#34;Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss,&#34; that would have been recognized in subsequent periods. Given the timing of the 2022 and 2020 Retiree Annuity Purchases, the plan remeasurements triggered as a result of the transactions were conducted as part of our annual valuation process. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 77 \n\n&#160; \n\nFUNDED STATUS OF PLANS \n\nThe funded status of the plans we sponsor is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation with the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.

The differences are actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that are deferred and amortized into periodic benefit costs in future periods. Unamortized amounts are recorded in &#34;Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss&#34;, which is a component of total equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet . The &#34;Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss&#34; section of Note 15: Shareholders&#8217; Interest details changes in these amounts by component. \n\n(4) For pension plans with a projected benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 2.9 billion and $ 2.5 billion at December 31, 2021, respectively. For pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.8 billion at December 31, 2022, respectively, and $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.5 billion at December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 78 \n\n&#160; \n\n(5) For the U.S. defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.4 % and 2.9 % for 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the Canadian defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.3 % and 3.1 % for 2022 and 2021, respectively. For U.S. OPEB plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.4 % and 2.6 % for 2022 and 2021, respectively. For Canadian OPEB plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.3 % and 3.0 % for 2022 and 2021, respectively. For lump sum distributions (for U.S. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only), the discount rate assumption was based on the PPA Phased Table: Interest and mortality assumptions as mandated by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. \n\n(6) For the U.S. defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for both 2022 and 2021 was between 2.00 % - 13.00 % for salaried participants and was decreasing with participant age. For the Canadian defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for 2022 was 1.00 % - 2.75 % and 2.00 % - 2.75 % for salaried and hourly participants, respectively, and the rate of compensation increase assumption for 2021 was 3.25 % and 3.00 % for salaried and hourly participants, respectively. \n\n(7) U.S. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only. \n\n(8) For U.S. OPEB plans, the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for the next year for Pre-Medicare was 5.70 % and 6.20 % for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption for Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) was 4.50 % for both 2022 and 2021. The ultimate healthcare cost trend rate was 4.50 % and the assumption for the year the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate is reached was 2037 in both 2022 and 2021. For Canadian OPEB plans, the healthcare cost trend rate was 5.20 % for 2022 and 5.30 % for 2021. The ultimate healthcare cost trend rate was 4.00 % and the assumption for the year the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate is reached was 2040 for both 2022 and 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nPENSION ASSETS \n\nOur Investment Policies and Strategies \n\nOur investment policies and strategies guide and direct how the funds are managed for the benefit plans we sponsor. These funds include our: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nU.S. Pension Trust &#8212; funds our U.S. qualified pension plans; \n\n&#61623; \n\nCanadian Pension Trust &#8212; funds our Canadian registered pension plans and \n\n&#61623; \n\nRetirement Compensation Arrangements &#8212; fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nU.S. and Canadian Pension Trusts \n\nIn 2018, we began to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that more closely aligns with our pension plan liability profile. Our former investment strategy included investments primarily in hedge funds and private equity funds. These asset classes are now in redemption and run-off mode. However, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a portion of the plan assets for several years. We expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values (NAV). As these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our revised investment strategy. \n\nThe revised investment strategy targets a percentage allocation to growth assets and a percentage allocation to liability hedging assets based on each plan&#8217;s funded status. We expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plan improves. Growth assets include investments in global equities, hedge funds (which are in redemption) and private equity assets (which are in run-off mode). Liability hedging assets include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securities as well as treasury futures selected to align with the plan liabilities. \n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell certain private equity and hedge fund investments to a third party for $ 189 million (2021 Secondary Sale) in accordance with our investment strategy. A majority of the assets were transferred to the buyer by year-end 2021. The balance of the assets included in the sale were held at the purchase price as of year-end 2021 and subsequently transferred in 2022 in accordance with the agreement. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 79 \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets within our U.S. and Canadian pension trusts were invested as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDECEMBER 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDECEMBER 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nCash and short-term investments (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.1 % \n\n&#160; \n\nPublic equity investments (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nFixed income investments: (3) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n42.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nGovernment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nRepurchase agreements \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.6 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1.3 \n\n) \n\nHedge funds and related investments (4)(5) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nPrivate equity and related investments (5)(6) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n34.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nDerivative instruments, net (7) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nAccrued liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 0.8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1.1 \n\n) \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 % \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) Cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market. The increased cash holding at year-end 2021 was a result of the 2021 Secondary Sale transaction timing. Refer to &#8220;U.S. and Canadian Pension Trusts&#8221; above for further information. \n\n(2) Public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active markets. \n\n(3) Fixed income investments include publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. These bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities. Additionally, our fixed income portfolio includes repurchase agreements, which represent short-term borrowings to hedge against interest rate risk. We have an obligation to return the cash related to these borrowings in accordance with the agreements, which are collateralized by our government bonds. Fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs. \n\n(4) Hedge funds and related investments are privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. General members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio managers and are thus responsible for the fund&#8217;s underlying investment decisions. Underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. These funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity and redemption provisions. \n\n(5) These investments are primarily valued based on the NAVs of the funds. These values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. When NAVs as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported NAVs for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year. \n\n(6) Private equity and related investments include both investments in private equity and investments in mezzanine distressed, co-investments and other structures. Private equity funds generally participate in buyout and venture capital strategies through unlisted equity and debt instruments. These funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level. Mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options. \n\n(7) Derivative instruments have historically been comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. Consistent with our shift in asset strategy, our positions in derivative instruments have been significantly reduced. At December 31, 2022, only a small amount of futures remain in our portfolio. Derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative&#8217;s counterparty. \n\n&#160; \n\nRetirement Compensation Arrangements \n\nRetirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans. As required by Canadian tax rules, approximately 50 percent of these assets are invested into a non-interest bearing refundable tax account held by the Canada Revenue Agency. This portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. The remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities. \n\nManaging Risk \n\nInvestments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, interest rate, credit, currency and liquidity risks. We mitigate these risks to our pension plan asset portfolios through investment in diversified portfolios, inclusion of fixed income investments that align with plan liabilities and investment in assets designed to address both currency and liquidity considerations. In addition, we and our investment advisers perform regular monitoring with ongoing qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments and investment and operational due diligence. \n\nValuation of Our Plan Assets \n\nPension assets are stated at fair value or NAV. Fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability. \n\nWe value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. Refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for details on the fair value hierarchy. \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 80 \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe net pension plan assets, when categorized in accordance with this fair value hierarchy, are as follows. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;

We believe that our line of credit has a net carrying value that approximates its fair value within an insignificant difference. The inputs to the valuations of our long-term debt are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date. \n\nFAIR VALUE OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nWe believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts. \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTE 14: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nThis note provides details about our: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nlegal proceedings, \n\n&#61623; \n\nenvironmental matters and \n\n&#61623; \n\ncommitments and other contingencies. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\nWe are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheet , Consolidated Statement of Operations or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows . \n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS \n\nSite Remediation \n\nUnder the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) &#8211; commonly known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; &#8211; and similar state laws, we are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated. \n\nWe have received notification from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the Kalamazoo River Superfund site in southwest Michigan. Our involvement in the remediation site is based on our operation of the Plainwell, Michigan mill, located within the remediation site, from 1954 to 1970. Several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under CERCLA. \n\nWe cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the EPA on April 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the Otsego Township Dam Area. During third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia-Pacific LLC in an action seeking contribution under CERCLA for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for 5 percent of approximately $ 50 million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. The remaining 95 percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants. The opinion and order does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn 2022, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court opinion, finding that Georgia-Pacific&#8217;s claims for cost contributions were time barred by the statute of limitations. Georgia-Pacific has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 86 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have established accruals for estimated remediation costs on the active Superfund sites and other sites for which we are a potentially responsible party.

We believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing accruals by up to $ 134 million. This estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. The estimate: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nis much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and \n\n&#61623; \n\nuses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\nassumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site, \n\n&#61623; \n\ntook into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and \n\n&#61623; \n\nconsidered each party&#8217;s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nWe have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\nWe have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in Canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. Some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. We have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. In situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.

Generally, compensation expense would not be reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service period has been completed. \n\nWeighted Average Assumptions Used in Estimating the Value of PSUs \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2022 GRANTS \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2021 GRANTS \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2020 GRANTS \n\n&#160; \n\nPerformance period \n\n&#160; \n\n2/10/2022 &#160;- 12/31/2024 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2/11/2021 &#160;- 12/31/2023 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2/13/2020 &#160;- 12/31/2022 \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected dividends \n\n&#160; \n\n1.72 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.99 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.50 % \n\n&#160; \n\nRisk-free rate \n\n&#160; \n\n0.34 % - 1.84 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.02 % - 0.20 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.45 % - 1.62 % \n\n&#160; \n\nVolatility \n\n&#160; \n\n26.27 % - 41.01 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n32.87 % - 52.82 % \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n20.02 % - 22.40 % \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted average grant-date fair value \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n49.77 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38.50 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33.16 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nActivity \n\nThe following table shows our PSU activity for 2022: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGRANTS \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT-DATE \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(IN THOUSANDS) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFAIR VALUE \n\n&#160; \n\nNonvested at December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,104 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n33.56 \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted at target \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n49.77 \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 416 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29.66 \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 52 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n43.69 \n\n&#160; \n\nPerformance adjustment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n29.66 \n\n&#160; \n\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n39.77 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 116 thous and PSUs that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 92 \n\n&#160; \n\nThe total grant-date fair value of PSUs vested was: \n\n##TABLE_START &#61623; \n\n$ 12 million in 2022, \n\n&#61623; \n\n$ 8 million in 2021 and \n\n&#61623; \n\n$ 3 million in 2020. \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nAs PSUs vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover participant taxes.

Our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 1 year to 25 years . Options to renew, extend or terminate a lease are reflected in our lease terms when we believe it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. When our leases do not provide an implicit or an explicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. \n\nLease Expense \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS \n\n&#160;

This recovery was attributable to our Wood Products segment and was recorded within &#8220;Other operating costs, net&#8221; in our Consolidated Statement of Operations . \n\n&#160; \n\nTIMBER CASUALTY LOSS \n\nIn September 2020, forest fires in the state of Oregon, commonly referred to as the Holiday Farm, Beachie Creek, Riverside, and Archie Creek fires, spread from adjacent lands onto portions of our Oregon timberland properties. Based on interpretation of satellite imagery and aerial photography, as well as limited on-site assessments, we estimated that the fires affected approximately 125 thousand acres of our Oregon timberlands. Our assessments indicated that the extent of damage varied from tract to tract based on topographical conditions, rate of fire spread, age of the timber and other circumstances. Based on these assessments, we expected that the majority of merchantable timber, even if affected by the fires, was likely salvageable if harvested within a reasonable period of time. We believed the majority of pre-merchantable timber affected by the fires would not be able to be salvaged. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn third quarter 2020, we recorded a timber casualty loss of $ 80 million which represented the estimated book value of timber and related assets that could not be salvaged based on information available at that time. The loss was attributable to our Timberlands segment and was recorded within &#8220;Other operating costs, net&#8221; in our Consolidated Statement of Operations . As of December 31, 2022, all salvage volume has been harvested. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 96 \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTE 20: IN COME TAXES \n\nThis note provides details about income taxes applicable to our operations, including the following: \n\n&#160;

      "text": " CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nBased on their evaluation, the company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed complies with the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL \n\n&#160; \n\nNo changes occurred in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rules. Management, under our supervision, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 100 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\n&#160; \n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors Weyerhaeuser Company: \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 17, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY &#62; 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 101 \n\n&#160; \n\n"
