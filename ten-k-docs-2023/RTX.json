RIS and RMD together represent a significant portion of those sales. In addition, as a global company, all four of our business segments have substantial international sales. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nU.S. Government Sales. Our U.S. government sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 \n\nSales to the U.S. government (1) \n\n$ 30,317 &#160; $ 31,177 $ 25,962 \n\nSales to the U.S. government as a percentage of Total Net Sales (1) \n\n45 &#160; % 48 % 46 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See &#8220;Note 21: Segment Financial Data&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nInternational Sales. Our sales to international customers, based on customer end use location, were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 \n\nTotal international sales (1) \n\n$ 25,884 &#160; $ 24,377 $ 22,027 \n\nTotal international sales as a percentage of Total Net Sales (1) \n\n39 &#160; % 38 % 39 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See &#8220;Note 21: Segment Financial Data&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nBacklog. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). \n\nTotal backlog was $175 billion and $156 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2022, we expect approximately 25% will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. \n\nCompetition \n\nAll of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, product development, innovation and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company. In addition, the competitive landscape in the industry segments we serve continues to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs. \n\nOur aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government&#8217;s and other governments&#8217; policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. \n\nOur defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. \n\nPeople \n\nAs a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete. \n\nDue to macroeconomic, industry and labor market conditions, we have experienced and continue to experience a highly competitive environment with respect to hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience, particularly personnel with specialized engineering experience and security clearances, which has negatively impacted our operating and financial performance. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and are working to mitigate this issue through talent acquisition, partnership, sourcing and recruiting arrangements, workforce succession planning, talent identification, development and advancement, engagement and recognition programs, and initiatives to attract and rehire former \n\nTable of Contents \n\nemployees. However, we expect the current labor market conditions and highly competitive employee hiring and retention environment to continue. \n\nGovernance. The Human Capital &#38; Compensation Committee of the RTC Board of Directors oversees the Company&#8217;s human capital management. \n\nWorkforce Demographics. As of December 31, 2022, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 182,000 employees, including approximately 55,000 engineering professionals and approximately 31,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees are located in 52 countries, with 70% of our employees located in the U.S. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&#38;I). We strive to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. We believe a work environment where all individuals are respected, valued and supported enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry&#8217;s greatest challenges. We have a DE&#38;I advisory board of senior leaders. We review diversity in talent development and promotion, employee compensation practices and succession planning, and embed DE&#38;I training into our leadership development programs. We have published our U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity EEO-1 report data as part of our Environmental Social Governance Report. We have nine diverse global employee resource groups, which are volunteer-run organizations that are open to all employees and are intended to foster an inclusive culture. We also invest in a more diverse workforce by supporting science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives for women and people of color, and providing opportunities and support to military veterans, people with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 25% of our global workforce and 33% of our global executives, and people of color represented 32% of our U.S. employee population and 17% of our U.S. executives. In addition, based on those employees who self-identified, veterans represented 12% of our U.S. employee population. \n\nTalent Acquisition, Development and Retention; Employee Health and Safety. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance and retain the best talent in the industry. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTC&#8217;s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and satisfaction. \n\nWe have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits and support flexible work arrangements for our employees. \n\nAdditional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our &#8220;People&#8221; section of our Environmental Social Governance Report that can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our Environmental Social Governance Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. \n\nFor information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nResearch and Development and Operations \n\nOur innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development (R&#38;D) activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers&#8217; changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities. \n\nWe manufacture and service our products in over 229 manufacturing, production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. In addition, RTC has offices in approximately 10 other countries. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nWe maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection \n\nTable of Contents \n\nwith the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. \n\nSuppliers and Raw Materials \n\nWe are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel and titanium. We also have some foreign suppliers as single-source suppliers of components. Global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, including raw material, microelectronics and commodity shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution issues, energy cost increases and price increases. We and many of our suppliers and subcontractors have ceased operations in Russia due to sanctions and have ceased sourcing of components that are subject to sanctions. Other suppliers and subcontractors are located in areas experiencing supply impediments or are at risk of being subjected to trade restrictive actions, due to current geopolitical conditions. In addition, some suppliers and subcontractors have been, or may in the future be, impacted by credit market conditions, including higher interest rates and the availability of credit. Our supplier and subcontractor performance continues to be affected by these issues, and we have experienced difficulties receiving necessary raw materials, components, other supplies and third-party services on a timely basis or at all. Our business has been negatively impacted by the above factors, as well as price increases arising from these issues and ongoing inflation. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain issues through targeted activities as well as through our ongoing supply chain programs. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assess the causes of performance failures and delays. We are providing our suppliers with access to our contract labor networks to augment supplier workforces, providing suppliers with raw materials and technical support, and leveraging our raw materials contracts to apply our negotiated rates to purchases by our suppliers. We are also working to arrange second and third supply source alternatives and have increased our inventory of available materials and parts. We regularly pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchased parts, expanding use of long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers generally (except as described above for important supply alternatives), strategic sourcing in cost competitive regions, competitions among suppliers and other low-cost sourcing initiatives. We also have a number of ongoing programs to manage our dependence on foreign raw material supply and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. In addition, to help address the risk of supplier closings or bankruptcies, we monitor the liquidity of our significant supplier base. For additional information related to supply chain issues, see Item IA. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nOther Matters Relating to Our Business \n\nAs worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; in Item 1. &#8220;Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,&#8221; and in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate. Commercial air travel has been significantly disrupted by the pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response. Commercial air travel has not fully returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. For additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nRegulatory Matters \n\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the DoD, the FAA, and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business. \n\nU.S. Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for \n\nTable of Contents \n\nconvenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD&#8217;s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor&#8217;s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. \n\nFor further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and Item 3. &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; of this Form 10-K and &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nCommercial Aerospace Product Regulation. Our commercial aerospace products are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations. \n\nEnvironmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon the U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; and &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nMost of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. \n\nIn addition, we could be affected by future foreign or domestic laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, and we monitor developments in environmental and climate-related laws and regulations and their potential impact to our business and financial condition. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, and mandatory disclosure obligations could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. \n\nFor further discussion of risks related to environmental and climate matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nOther Applicable Regulations. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and \n\nTable of Contents \n\npractices, including regulations relating to import-export controls, tariffs, taxes, investment, sanctions, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. \n\nCautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results \n\nThis Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; under the securities laws.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. \n\nINDUSTRY RISKS \n\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic, capital market and political conditions. Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, international relations and geopolitical events and actions, including inflation, credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, trade policies, exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, the threat environment, political conditions, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. The current global supply chain and labor market challenges and inflationary pressures have negatively affected, and we expect will continue to negatively affect, our performance as well as the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. In addition, due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we may be unable to increase our contract value or pricing to offset cost increases, in particular on our fixed price contracts. Our operating profits and margins under our contracts could be adversely affected by these factors. Similarly, interest rate increases have created financial market volatility and could further negatively impact financial markets, lead to an economic downturn or recession, and tighten the availability of, and increase the cost of capital for, the Company, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Tightening of credit in financial markets also could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, could impact the ability of our customers to make payments, and could increase the risk of supplier financial distress. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. In addition, geopolitical risks could affect government priorities, budgets and policies, such as U.S. approvals of our foreign defense sales as well as sanctions and other trade-restrictive activities, which could impact sales of defense and other products and services. \n\nChanges in U.S. government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and overall business. U.S. government sales constitute a significant portion of our consolidated sales. Our U.S. government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. Changes in U.S. government defense spending for various reasons, including as a result of potential changes in policy or budgetary positions or priorities, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our programs are subject to U.S. government policies, budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including U.S. domestic and broader geopolitical events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, and the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both governmental shutdowns and continuing resolutions (CRs) providing only enough funds for U.S. government agencies to continue operating at prior-year levels. Further, if the U.S. government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its debts. As a result, U.S. government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nWe face risks relating to our U.S. government contracts and the mix of our U.S. government contracts and programs. The termination of one or more of our U.S. government contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns (due to inflation or otherwise), product failures, shortages in materials, components or labor, or contract definitization delays, could negatively impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government&#8217;s convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts, and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We may not be able to offset lost revenues resulting from contract termination. Moreover, because the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncongressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. The timing of contract definitization can be affected by factors specific to the U.S. government, including staffing limitations. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer&#8217;s desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result of untested or unproven technologies, or modified requirements or specifications, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties (including delays, setbacks, cost overruns, or product failures), our attention or resources may be diverted from other projects and our future sales opportunities may be impacted. Additionally, as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions, we may be required to invest in development prior to contract award with no guarantee of award. \n\nOur U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable, they can be FFP or FPI, which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracting during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing (e.g., one-third of program costs). They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. In addition, in order to support U.S. government priorities, we may begin performance prior to completing contract negotiations for an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability. Our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims. \n\nOur international business is subject to economic, regulatory, competition and other risks. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with political and economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition and other risks. A significant portion of our sales are international, including U.S. export sales. Our non-U.S. operations transactions may be denominated in local currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (including their impact on supplier prices) may negatively affect demand for our products and our reported profits, as well as our operating margins. The majority of our commercial aerospace sales are in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of their non-U.S. costs are incurred in the applicable local currency. Pratt &#38; Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason. In addition, because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars, currency fluctuations may cause translation gains or losses for non-U.S. operating unit financial statements. \n\nOur international sales and operations are also subject to risks associated with local government laws, regulations and policies, including with respect to investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings. Differing legal systems, customs and contract laws and regulations pose additional risk. International transactions may include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries. In addition, in certain foreign countries, we engage foreign non-employee representatives and consultants for \n\nTable of Contents \n\ninternational sales and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers for international programs. While we have robust policies and controls in place, these engagements expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local antibribery laws and regulations. From time to time, we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration. In addition, we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products. \n\nOur international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies or our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies. \n\nOur international contracts, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may include offset or industrial cooperation obligations requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay contract awards. Certain customers&#8217; demands are increasing for greater offset or ICIP commitment levels, higher-value content, including the transfer of technologies and capabilities, and local production and economic development. \n\nAs a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nGeopolitical factors and changes in policies and regulations could adversely affect our business. Our international sales and operations are sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, and regional and local political and economic factors, including volatility in energy prices or supply, political or civil unrest, changes in threat environments and political relations, geopolitical uncertainties, and changes in U.S. foreign policy. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls and other trade restrictions. Events such as increased trade restrictions or retaliatory trade policies, renegotiation of existing trade agreements, or regime change can affect demand for our products and services, the competitive position of our products, our supply chain, and our ability to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. Further, operations in emerging market countries are subject to additional risks, including volatility in gross domestic product and rates of economic growth, government instability, cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nIn addition, given the role of our defense businesses in the support of the national security interests of the U. S. and its allies, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to policies of the U.S. and its allies, as well as other countries, including those that are or become regarded as potential adversaries or threats. We engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in budgets and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions or other restrictions, as well as potential human rights issues associated with the use of our defense products. These risks and uncertainties may directly or indirectly impact our commercial businesses as well. \n\nOf note, China previously announced it may take measures against Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTC) in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan involving RTC products and services. In addition, China has indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes, in connection with another potential foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTC products and services. RTC is not aware of any specific sanctions against Mr. Hayes or RTC, or the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or countermeasures. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, affiliates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. From time to time, our businesses have sold, and are expected to sell in the future, additional defense products to Taiwan, and we are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, of any future sanctions or other actions by China in response to these sales. Moreover, the Chinese government has generally expanded its ability to restrict China-related import, export and investment activities, which may have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business or sell our commercial aerospace products in China. In addition, in response to the Russian military&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others, have \n\nTable of Contents \n\nimposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. \n\nOur financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry. Our aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results, and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines, lessors, other aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, bankruptcies and restructuring activities, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, tightening of credit in financial markets, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and remaining performance obligations levels. Any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery in the future, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts with customers, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service. A reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nWe design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. The design, development, production, sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense systems and products involves advanced technologies. We invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services aimed at meeting the ever-evolving product, program and service needs of our customers. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; receiving regulatory approvals; execution of internal and external performance plans; achieving cost and production efficiencies; availability and quality of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services; availability of test equipment; development of complex software; hiring and training of qualified personnel; identification of emerging technological trends for our target end-customers; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and technologies. For example, our customers manufacture or acquire end products and systems that incorporate certain of our products. These end products and systems may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and industry acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. In addition, many of our products must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards in a variety of jurisdictions. The evolving nature of these standards, along with the long duration of development, production and aftermarket support programs, creates uncertainty regarding program profitability, particularly with our aircraft engine products. Development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the industries for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers&#8217; products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns. Delays and/or \n\nTable of Contents \n\nsuspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nIn particular, Pratt &#38; Whitney is currently producing and delivering the Geared Turbofan engine to power various aircraft. The level of orders received for the Geared Turbofan family of engines, coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame, require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers&#8217; delivery schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. \n\nCompetition may reduce our revenues and limit our future opportunities. We operate in highly competitive industries and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing capabilities than we do. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based in part upon the cost to provide the products and services. If we fail to accurately estimate these costs, the profitability of our contracts may be adversely affected. In addition, we may face customer-directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if these targets are not achieved when required. We have also experienced highly competitive pricing, in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win the work. Moreover, bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are frequent with respect to DoD awards in particular. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements, in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products. Further, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products, or meet particular in-demand technological needs before us or with technology that is superior to our existing or new technologies. In addition, our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offerings. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. We also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors&#8217; capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration. We are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for space-related technologies and for information technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core businesses, we may experience declines in revenues and industry segment share which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic has affected our business, and we continue to face risks associated with it. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate. The pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response, including lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, remote working, facilities closures and reduced business and leisure travel, led to significant declines in demand for commercial air travel in 2020 and 2021 and, therefore, for our commercial aerospace products and services. While we have seen signs of ongoing recovery in the overall demand for commercial air travel and currently expect that recovery to continue, some commercial aviation segments have recovered less quickly than others, and it remains uncertain when commercial air traffic will fully return to and/or exceed pre-pandemic levels. The resulting financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. In addition, a resurgence of the pandemic (including COVID-19 variants), regional lockdowns or other negative developments associated with the pandemic could hinder or reverse the commercial air traffic recovery. Negative developments concerning the effect of the pandemic or additional variants, the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines, new or continued actions to contain the pandemic&#8217;s spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic (lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, remote working, facilities closures, and reduced business and leisure travel patterns and work environments) could create significant business disruption for us and our suppliers, subcontractors and customers, exacerbate existing supply chain and labor shortages, redirect government funds and decrease defense budgets, and negatively affect global economic conditions. These factors could hinder or delay our production capabilities, impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers, result in increased costs to us and decreased demand for our products and services, and could negatively affect our performance on our customer \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncontracts and our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The ultimate duration and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown at this time. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nWe depend on the availability of materials and performance of our suppliers, and the impacts of global supply chain and labor market disruptions on our supply chain have negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business. Our performance requires a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services, and we rely on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors and service providers) and commodity markets for these materials and services. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use. Our defense businesses also must require suppliers to comply with various DoD requirements, including cybersecurity requirements, any of which requirements may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize. Identifying and qualifying second- or third- source suppliers can be difficult, time-consuming and may result in increased costs. \n\nIn addition, global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution issues, energy cost increases and price increases. Current geopolitical conditions, including sanctions and other trade restrictive activities and strained intercountry relations, are contributing to these issues. Certain of our suppliers and subcontractors have been unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel for their performance. We and our suppliers and subcontractors have also experienced difficulties in procuring necessary raw materials and components, including microelectronics. All of the above have contributed to price increases. These issues have led to significant supplier and subcontractor performance failures and delays. As a result of these various problems, we have had difficulties receiving necessary materials, components, other supplies and third-party services timely or at all, which have negatively impacted production flow in our factories, hindered our ability to perform on our commitments to customers and negatively affected our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our supply costs have increased due to the above factors. Continuing high inflation has exacerbated these increases and increased our operating costs. In addition, we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel and titanium. Moreover, some of our single-source components are sourced from foreign countries. Some raw materials and components have been in the past sourced from areas now under sanctions, such as Russia, or are currently sourced from areas which are at risk of sanctions or other trade restrictive actions, such as China. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain issues and risks, including providing raw materials and technical support to our suppliers and subcontractors, as well as providing them with access to our contract labor networks to augment supplier and subcontractor workforces; seeking alternate supply sources; increasing our inventory of available materials and parts; pursuing various cost reductions such as long-term agreements; and leveraging our raw materials supply contracts to apply our negotiated rates to our suppliers&#8217; purchases. \n\nThe timing of the impacts of these supply chain risks and issues and our ability to mitigate them are uncertain and difficult to predict. However, we expect the current supply chain, labor availability and price issues, and their negative impacts on our business, to continue. In particular, we expect to experience prolonged delays for certain critical component parts and sub-systems. Furthermore, the existing supply chain and labor market issues could be compounded by other events, such as an economic downturn; supplier capacity constraints for other reasons; supplier quality issues (for example, defects or fraudulent parts); supplier closing, bankruptcy or financial difficulties; price increases for various reasons; worsening shortages of raw materials or commodities; and energy supply constraints, including as a result of war or other geopolitical actions, natural disaster (including the effects of climate change), health pandemic or other business continuity events, or transport and distribution issues, any of which could further negatively impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs and therefore incrementally affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nDue to the nature of our products and services, a product safety failure or other failure affecting our or our customers&#8217; or suppliers&#8217; products or systems could seriously harm our business. Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies, are often integrated with third-party products and services and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision, reliability and durability. Many of our products and services include both hardware and software that involve industrial machinery and intricate aviation and defense systems, including commercial and military jet engines, power and control systems and other aircraft parts, air and missile defense systems, and military sensors and command and control systems. Technical, mechanical and other failures may occur from time to time, whether as a result of manufacturing or design defect, operational process or production issue attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, third party integrators or others. In addition, our products could fail as a result of cyber-attacks, such as those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our products, or other intentional acts. The impact of a catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customers&#8217; or suppliers&#8217; products or services could be significant, and could result in injuries \n\nTable of Contents \n\nor death, property damage, loss of strategic capabilities, loss of intellectual property, loss of reputation, and other significant negative effects. A product or system failure could lead to negative publicity, a diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. It could also result in product recalls and product liability and warranty claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) and related expenses, other service, repair and maintenance costs, significant damages and other costs, including fines and other remedies and regulatory and environmental liabilities. We may also incur increased costs, delayed payments, reputational harm or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party&#8217;s product with which our products are integrated. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract, train and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business. Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers, and the hiring, development and retention of qualified technical, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. In addition, we experienced personnel reductions when the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant declines in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services, but current demand for our products and services across our businesses has created a significant need for us to hire additional and replacement personnel. Moreover, a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel in the future, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of knowledge. \n\nCurrent macroeconomic, industry and labor market conditions have exacerbated an already highly competitive market for hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience. There is an ongoing labor shortage, particularly for highly qualified personnel including engineers, skilled laborers and security clearance holders. Labor market trends also include high attrition and wage inflation, and some candidates and new personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce. As a result of the above factors, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel with relevant qualifications and experience, which has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nIn addition, certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. We also may not be successful in training or developing qualified personnel with the requisite relevant skills or security clearances. Loss of key employees, increased attrition for various reasons, failure to adequately train newly hired employees, delays in receiving required security clearances, or delays in hiring key personnel could also seriously harm our business. \n\nMoreover, we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract, train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration, diversity and inclusion, and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture, and a failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact us. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion. To the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting or people management, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results. In addition, failure or perceived failure to meet increasing stakeholder expectations on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters could harm our reputation and impact demand for our products and services. \n\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products. Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from, among other causes, cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security. We also encounter attempts to infiltrate our products and services and sabotage or disable their use by our customers. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely, both on premises and in the cloud, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. We are also exposed to the risk of insider threat attacks. Any such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties (including \n\nTable of Contents \n\nmission critical systems), impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. The threats we face are continuous and evolving, and vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that we are unable to defend against all cyber attacks, that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected and persist in the environment for an extended period, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, some products and services that we provide to customers, particularly those related to public security, may raise potential liabilities related to privacy and intellectual property. In some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Some of these risks may be heightened due to the Company and its suppliers and other third parties operating with a significant number of employees working remotely. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. \n\nExports and imports of certain of our products are subject to various export control, sanctions and import regulations and may require authorization from regulatory agencies of the U.S. or other countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the U.S. Department of State, embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice. Certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR, the Commerce Control List of the EAR or are otherwise subject to the EAR, and/or the U.S. Munitions Import List and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the appropriate U.S. government agencies before selling these products outside of the U.S. or importing these products into the U.S. U.S. foreign policy or foreign policy of other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. Any failure by us, our customers or our suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export or import our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Moreover, any changes in export control, sanctions or import regulations may further restrict the export or import of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Our ability to obtain required licenses and authorizations on a timely basis or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. government laws, regulations or foreign policies, delays in Congressional action, or geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be prevented or delayed, and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed. Any restrictions on the export or import of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by threats to our physical security and other events outside our control. We could encounter threats to our physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from, workplace violence, civil unrest, terrorism or similar acts, any of which could disrupt our business. In addition, our business, and the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors and service providers and customers, could be disrupted by public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), damaging weather or other acts of nature, cyber-attacks on IT infrastructure and products or other events outside of our control. Any such business disruption could subject us to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, financial losses from remedial actions, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources, or loss of business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain third party intellectual property; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property or access to third party intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, confidentiality obligations in contracts, IT security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in performance of government contracts. Governments may use or authorize others (including our competitors) to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. Governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights, which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. Intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. In addition, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. In other instances, our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants. Governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others, which may affect our ability to perform government contracts. Moreover, our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership of necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nLEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY RISKS \n\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are subject to U.S. government investigations relating to our U.S. government contracts. Such U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could fine and debar us from new U.S. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports&#8217; theories were to prevail in litigation, also have future impacts such as increasing the costs absorbed by our commercial businesses. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. We may be, and have been, required to make significant payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with interest. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has convened grand juries to \n\nTable of Contents \n\ninvestigate possible irregularities in our costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the U.S. government or must be refunded by us to the U.S. government if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. \n\nWe are subject to litigation, environmental, anti-corruption and other legal and compliance risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, export control, employment matters, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines as well as other harm to our business as discussed above. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. \n\nWe use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties&#8217; employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have been named as a defendant in related &#8220;toxic tort&#8221; claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations that: (1) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \n\nIn addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and -corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and -corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and -corruption laws, and could be subject to such investigations in the future, which could result in criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management attention and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCybersecurity and data security and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. \n\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by climate change, including changes in regulations, customer demand, technologies and extreme weather. Our business may be impacted by climate change and governmental and industry actions taken in response, which present short, medium and long-term risks to our business and financial condition. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, mandatory disclosure obligations and U.S. government procurement requirements, could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes, and lead to new or additional investments in product designs and facility upgrades. In addition, we continue to see ever-increasing demands for offerings focused on addressing climate change, transitioning to lower emission technologies, including low to no carbon products and services, the use of alternative energy sources and other sustainable aviation technologies, and climate adaptation products and services. Customers, shareholders and institutional investors continue to increase their focus on ESG, including our environmental sustainability practices and commitments with respect to our operations, products and suppliers. As a result, we anticipate that we will need to make additional investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing. We may not realize, on a timely basis or at all, the anticipated benefits of these investments and actions for a variety of reasons, including technological challenges, evolving government and customer requirements and our ability to anticipate them and develop in-demand technologies on a timely basis, and other risks related to the development of advanced technologies described above. In addition, certain technologies will be dependent upon government action, such as investments in infrastructure, creating appropriate market incentives and making certain raw materials available for development of certain technologies. Moreover, we rely on our suppliers to timely and effectively adapt and meet our evolving technological supply needs, and they may be unable to fully respond to our requirements in a timely manner or at all. We also face competition risks as our competitors also respond to advancing sustainable technologies. Our competitors may develop these in-demand technologies before we do, their new technologies may be deemed by our customers to be superior to technologies we may develop, and their technologies may otherwise gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. In addition, as we and our competitors develop increasingly sustainable technologies, demand for our older offerings may decrease or become nonexistent. Our reputation may also be damaged if we or our industry fail, or are perceived to fail, to achieve sustainability goals or commitments or to comply with evolving climate-related regulations. In addition, climate-related litigation and government investigations could be commenced against us, could be costly to defend and could adversely affect our business. Moreover, our business, the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors, service providers, distributors and customers, and the industries in which we operate could be negatively impacted by increasing frequency and severity of acute extreme weather events caused by climate change, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, snow and ice storms, fires, heat waves, and mud slides, and by chronic changes in weather patterns, such as temperature increases, drought and sea level rise. These events could damage our and our suppliers&#8217; facilities, products and other assets, and cause disruptions to our business and operations, supply chain and distribution networks, and the businesses of our customers, and require an increase in expenditures to improve climate resiliency of our operations. Any of the foregoing could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our costs and expenses. \n\nFINANCIAL, TAX AND INSURANCE RELATED RISKS \n\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Accounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among other variables. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or ICIP agreements, required under certain contracts. Because of the significance of management&#8217;s judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in \n\nTable of Contents \n\nunderlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. \n\nSignificant changes in key estimates and assumptions with respect to our retirement plans, such as discount rate, expected return on plan assets (EROA), and other actuarial factors, could affect our future earnings, equity and pension contributions. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plans&#8217; expense or income, which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate, EROA and other actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. They may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, regulatory, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense, the plans&#8217; funded status, and/or the required cash contributions to such plans, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions. \n\nAdditional tax expense or exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as our income tax expense and tax payments. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets, and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, primarily recorded as the result of historical acquisitions or investments in businesses. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. In the event of an impairment, any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination. Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or accelerated amortization of finite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe may be unable to obtain debt at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our business requirements. If we require additional funding in order to meet our business requirements, a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our business requirements. \n\nQuarterly cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to uncertainties and may affect our common stock price . Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow, borrowings and proceeds from divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company&#8217;s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and are based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings, the availability of domestic cash and overall business expectations. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or suspension or elimination of our share repurchase \n\nTable of Contents \n\nprogram could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program&#8217;s effectiveness. \n\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace, defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products and services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future. \n\nSTRATEGIC INITIATIVE AND TRANSACTION RISKS \n\nWe may be unable to realize expected benefits from strategic initiatives. In order to operate more effectively and efficiently, from time to time we undertake strategic and other operational initiatives. For example, we are undergoing a significant, multi-year digital transformation initiative to improve our business and reduce costs. Under this initiative, we are leveraging digital capabilities throughout the way in which we conduct our business and provide our products and services to customers, including how we design, build and maintain our products and services. We also continue to engage our Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating system to drive continuing improvement into our processes and facilities. In addition, we continue to invest in structural cost reduction in our facilities, including aligning work to more efficient manufacturing centers, implementing advanced manufacturing capabilities including automation, and closing facilities that are not required to meet future capacity and work needs. Other initiatives include the pursuit of advanced technologies and new business acquisitions and subsequent integrations. We also implement restructuring plans from time to time. For example, we recently announced our plans to reorganize our current business segment structure from four to three business segments in the second half of 2023. Restructuring activities include or may result in workforce reductions, global facility reductions, procurement cost reduction activities, legal entity and operational reorganizations and other cost reduction initiatives. These strategic activities are complex and require the investment of resources including in personnel and systems. If we do not successfully manage our current or future strategic initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, certain U.S. government contracts and programs have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capabilities, and our inability to achieve these capabilities with respect to these programs timely may result in loss of revenues. Risks associated with workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages. Any of the above factors may impair our ability to achieve anticipated benefits, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nWe may be unable to successfully complete the integration of the legacy businesses of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon Company and realize the anticipated benefits of the Raytheon merger. The ultimate success of the Raytheon merger continues to depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate UTC and Raytheon Company&#8217;s legacy businesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies from the Raytheon merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. We continue to be exposed to risks associated with our ability to identify and achieve revenue synergy opportunities among the legacy businesses. In addition, we may be unable to consolidate all of the corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminate all of the duplicative operations which we intend, and continue to be at risk for unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems. Any one of these challenges could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, reduced expected cash generation, and diversion of management&#8217;s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. \n\nIf we fail to manage potential future acquisitions, investments, divestitures, joint ventures and other transactions successfully, these activities could adversely affect our future financial results. In pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other teaming and \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncollaborative arrangements. We undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and business opportunities into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Further, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including: (1) the risks involved with entering new markets&#894; (2) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements&#894; (3) the complexity of separating a portion of our business to enable a divestiture; (4) challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments&#894; (5) unidentified issues not discovered in RTC&#8217;s due diligence&#894; (6) the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; (7) the potential impairment of acquired assets&#894; (8) the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies&#894; and (9) the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. In addition, future transactions may impact our deployment of capital, including dividends, stock repurchases, pension contributions, and investments. \n\nIf either distribution of the stock of Carrier or Otis, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock (including pursuant to the Raytheon merger), we could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the Separation Transactions. UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the Distributions) effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020.We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation Transactions and Distributions and (2) an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Distributions under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if such Distribution(s) were deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan (when aggregated with any pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable, such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to us. For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in us. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of certain Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely affect an investment in us. Further, under a tax matters agreement that we entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for certain taxes we may incur resulting from the Separation Transactions and/or the Distributions failing to qualify for the intended tax treatment. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses. \n\n"

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe following Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) is intended to provide information to the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements between select periods and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. In addition, we discuss certain accounting principles, policies and critical estimates that affect our financial statements. Our discussion also contains some additional context regarding our business, including industry considerations and the business environment, as well as certain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW \n\nWe are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. We operate in four principal business segmen ts: Collins Aerospace (Collins), Pratt &#38; Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense (RMD). The Company recently announced its intention to streamline the structure of its core businesses into three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt &#38; Whitney and Raytheon. The Company plans to determine the exact composition of each segment and implement the reorganization in the second half of 2023. All segment information included in this Form 10-K is reflective of the existing four segments of Collins, Pratt &#38; Whitney, RIS and RMD in accordance with the management structure in place as of December 31, 2022. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;Raytheon Technologies,&#8221; and &#8220;RTC&#8221; mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. \n\nIndustry Considerations \n\nOur worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business primarily at RIS, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. \n\nCollins and Pratt &#38; Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services. \n\nRIS, RMD, and the defense operations of Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political environment and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. In addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to U.S. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions or other restrictions. \n\nGovernment legislation, policies and regulations can impact our business and operations. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. In addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government-imposed travel restrictions and limitations, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. \n\nBusiness Environment \n\nGlobal economic and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, international and domestic tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nsupply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. \n\nGlobal Supply Chain and Labor Markets. Global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, including raw material, microelectronics and commodity shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution problems and price increases. Current geopolitical conditions, including sanctions and other trade restrictive activities and strained intercountry relations, are contributing to these issues. We have had difficulties procuring necessary materials, including raw materials, components and other supplies, and services on a timely basis or at all. We have also had difficulties hiring qualified personnel, particularly personnel with specialized engineering experience and security clearances. Our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by the same issues, as well as ongoing pandemic-related issues, compounding the shortages for us because we rely on them, sometimes as sole-source providers. In addition, as the ongoing recovery in commercial air travel continues, the anticipated increase in new aircraft deliveries and increased demand for our products and services will add to these supply chain and labor market challenges. \n\nWe work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain and labor constraints through targeted activities and ongoing programs. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assist in mitigation, arrange supply source alternatives, increase our inventory of available materials and parts, and regularly pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms. We also continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and work to mitigate constraints through talent acquisition, partnership, sourcing and recruiting arrangements, workforce succession planning, and initiatives to attract, retain and rehire former employees. \n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, uncertainty continues with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. The pace of the commercial aerospace recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation, an economic downturn, or government budget deficits, among other factors, and may also be impacted by a resurgence of the pandemic and corresponding travel restrictions and protocols. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. \n\nGeopolitical Matters. In response to the Russian military&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we reversed $1.3 billion of backlog, which would have been recognized over a span of approximately 10 years, and recorded certain impairment charges and increases to reserves related to operations at our Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins businesses, as discussed further in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These adverse impacts have been mitigated in part by the identification of alternative suppliers and an increase in the global demand for our products as a result of the current geopolitical environment. Based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n\nChina previously announced that it may take measures against RTC in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. In addition, China has indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes, in connection with another potential foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTC products and services. RTC is not aware of any specific sanctions against Mr. Hayes or RTC, or the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or countermeasures. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, affiliates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. \n\nWe have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval have been pending. The U.S. government&#8217;s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nLikewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. In particular, as of December 31, 2022, our Contract liabilities include approximately $385 million of advance payments received from a Middle East customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute or obtain required regulatory approvals. These advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. \n\nSee Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; within Part I of this Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nNew Legislation. In August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Sciences Act and the Inflation Reduction Act were signed into law, each effective as of January 1, 2023. These new pieces of legislation include the implementation of a new corporate alternative minimum tax, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. We are evaluating the legislation and currently do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY \n\nWe use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations: \n\n&#8226; Net Sales: a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year; \n\n&#8226; Operating Profit (Loss): a measure of our profit (loss) for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and income taxes; and \n\n&#8226; Operating Profit (Loss) Margin: a measure of our Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of Total Net Sales. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 67,074 &#160; $ 64,388 $ 56,587 Operating profit (loss) 5,414 &#160; 4,958 (1,889) Operating profit (loss) margins 8.1 &#160; % 7.7 % (3.3) % Operating cash flow from continuing operations $ 7,168 &#160; $ 7,142 $ 4,334 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn order to better assess the underlying performance of our business, we also focus on the change in organic net sales on both a consolidated basis and business segment basis, and the change in organic operating profit (loss) on a business segment basis, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. See Results of Operations below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss), which are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies. \n\nWe also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $175 billion and $156 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts. \n\nIn addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow, both of which are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. \n\nConsidered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. \n\nA discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Results of Operations, Segment Review, and Liquidity and Financial Condition. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nAs described in our &#8220;Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results&#8221; of this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. As such, the results of RIS and RMD for the second quarter of 2020 exclude results prior to the date of completion of the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRaytheon merger, the estimated impact of which is approximately $400 million of sales and approximately $45 million of operating profit. These amounts, in addition to the first quarter of 2021 results, have been excluded from the organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2021 disclosed throughout our Results of Operations discussion. In addition, as a result of the separation of United Technologies Corporation&#8217;s (UTC&#8217;s) business into three independent, publicly traded companies &#8211; UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (the Separation Transactions) and the Distributions, the historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. \n\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments. We believe that these non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales and Operating profit (loss) excludes Acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit (loss) excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment. \n\nNet Sales ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 67,074 &#160; $ 64,388 $ 56,587 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe factors contributing to the total change year-over-year in Total Net Sales are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 \n\nOrganic (1) \n\n$ 3,660 &#160; $ 724 Acquisitions and divestitures, net (676) 6,961 Other (298) 116 Total change $ 2,686 &#160; $ 7,801 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. \n\nNet sales increased $3.7 billion organically in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher organic sales of $2.5 billion at Pratt &#38; Whitney and $2.4 billion at Collins, partially offset by lower organic sales of $0.6 billion at RMD. The $0.7 billion decrease in net sales related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily driven by the sale of our global training and services business within our RIS segment in the fourth quarter of 2021 . The decrease in other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 represents the impact of foreign exchange. \n\nNet sales increased $0.7 billion organically in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher organic sales of $1.3 billion at Pratt &#38; Whitney, partially offset by lower organic sales of $0.6 billion at Collins. The $7.0 billion sales increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by the sale of the Collins military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021. \n\nSee &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below for further information by segment. \n\n##TABLE_START % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Net sales Products sales $ 50,773 &#160; $ 49,270 $ 43,319 76 &#160; % 77 % 77 % Services sales 16,301 &#160; 15,118 13,268 24 &#160; % 23 % 23 % Total net sales $ 67,074 &#160; $ 64,388 $ 56,587 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nRefer to &#8220;Note 21: Segment Financial Data&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the composition of external net sales by products and services by segment. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNet products sales increased $1.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in external products sales of $1.5 billion at Collins and $1.2 billion at Pratt &#38; Whitney, partially offset by decreases in external products sales of $0.7 billion at RMD and $0.5 billion at RIS. Net services sales increased $1.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in external services sales of $1.2 billion at Pratt &#38; Whitney and $0.5 billion at Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services sales of $0.5 billion at RIS primarily driven by the sale of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021 . \n\nNet products sales increased $6.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external products sales of $3.7 billion at RMD and $3.0 billion at RIS, both primarily due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external products sales of $1.0 billion at Pratt &#38; Whitney, partially offset by a decrease in external products sales of $1.3 billion at Collins. Net services sales grew $1.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of $0.8 billion at RIS and $0.4 billion at RMD, both primarily due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external services sales of $0.4 billion at Pratt &#38; Whitney and $0.3 billion at Collins. \n\nOur sales to major customers were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 \n\nSales to the U.S. government (1) \n\n$ 30,317 &#160; $ 31,177 $ 25,962 45 &#160; % 48 % 46 % Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 5,042 &#160; 5,546 4,585 8 &#160; % 9 % 8 % Foreign government direct commercial sales 4,327 &#160; 4,993 3,974 6 &#160; % 8 % 7 % Commercial aerospace and other commercial sales 27,388 &#160; 22,672 22,066 41 &#160; % 35 % 39 % Total net sales $ 67,074 &#160; $ 64,388 $ 56,587 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. \n\nCost of Sales ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total cost of sales $ 53,406 &#160; $ 51,897 $ 48,056 Percentage of net sales 80 &#160; % 81 % 85 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe factors contributing to the change year-over-year in total Cost of sales are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 \n\nOrganic (1) \n\n$ 2,368 &#160; $ (1,293) Acquisitions and divestitures, net (552) 5,829 Restructuring 3 &#160; (363) FAS/CAS operating adjustment 234 &#160; (643) Acquisition accounting adjustments (348) 345 Other (196) (34) Total change $ 1,509 &#160; $ 3,841 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. \n\nThe organic increase in total Cost of sales in 2022 compared to 2021 of $2.4 billion was primarily due to the organic sales increases at Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney noted above. The decrease related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by t he sale of our global training and services business within our RIS segment in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in other cost of sales of $0.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by charges recorded during the first quarter of 2022 at Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins related to impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, inventory reserves, purchase order obligations, and the impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nThe organic decrease in total Cost of sales in 2021 compared to 2020 of $1.3 billion was primarily due to an organic Cost of sales decrease at Collins and RMD. The Collins decrease was primarily due to the sales decrease noted above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments. The RMD decrease was primarily due to the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nrecognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts as further described in &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below. These decreases in Cost of sales were partially offset by an increase in organic Cost of sales at Pratt &#38; Whitney due to the organic sales increases noted above. The increase related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $5.8 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by the sale of the Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020, and the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 as further discussed in &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The $0.4 billion decrease in Restructuring is primarily due to the absence of 2020 severance and restructuring actions at Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins related to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing cost reduction efforts. \n\nFor further discussion on FAS/CAS operating adjustment see the &#8220;FAS/CAS operating adjustment&#8221; subsection under the &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; section below.

The changes at Collins, Pratt &#38; Whitney and RIS were related to the changes in products sales noted above. Net services cost of sales increased $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in external services cost of sales at Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services sales at RIS, all driven by the services sales changes noted above. \n\nNet products cost of sales increased $3.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in external products cost of sales at RIS and RMD principally due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external products cost of sales at Pratt &#38; Whitney, principally driven by the products sales increase noted above, partially offset by a decrease in external products cost of sales at Collins, principally driven by the products sales decrease noted above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments. Net services cost of sales grew $0.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales at RIS and RMD principally due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. \n\nResearch and Development ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Company-funded $ 2,711 &#160; $ 2,732 $ 2,582 Percentage of net sales 4.0 &#160; % 4.2 % 4.6 % \n\nCustomer-funded (1) \n\n$ 4,376 &#160; $ 4,485 $ 4,111 Percentage of net sales 6.5 &#160; % 7.0 % 7.3 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Included in Cost of sales in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nResearch and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year fluctuations in spending levels are expected. \n\nCompany-funded research and development in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. The increase in company-funded research and development of $0.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by $0.2 billion related to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. \n\nThe decrease in customer-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily driven by lower expenses on various programs at RMD, partially offset by an increase in expenses on the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program at RMD. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $0.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by lower expenses of $0.2 billion on various military and commercial programs at Pratt &#38; Whitney and lower expenses of $0.1 billion at Collins primarily related to the sale of the military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nSelling, General and Administrative ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,663 &#160; $ 5,224 $ 5,540 Percentage of net sales 8.4 &#160; % 8.1 % 9.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher information technology-related costs at Corporate, Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney, and higher combined expenses at Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney principally driven by higher employee-related costs and $0.1 billion of charges related to increased estimates for credit losses due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by the absence of $0.4 billion of prior year charges related to increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at our Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins segments, lower costs of $0.3 billion due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021, and lower general and administrative restructuring costs of $0.3 billion primarily related to 2020 severance and restructuring actions at Collins and Corporate related to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raytheon merger and ongoing cost reduction efforts, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $0.4 billion related to the Raytheon merger, and higher employee-related costs. \n\nOther Income, Net ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Other income, net $ 120 &#160; $ 423 $ 885 ##TABLE_END\n\nOther income, net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other ongoing and nonrecurring items. \n\nThe decrease in Other income, net of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the absence of a gain of $269 million on the sale of RIS&#8217;s global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021, as further discussed in &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, $69 million of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses at Collins in the second quarter of 2022, a $42 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core Naval Power business at RMD, and the absence of prior year foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19 at Pratt &#38; Whitney of $41 million, partially offset by the absence of an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD. \n\nThe decrease in Other income, net of $0.5 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily due to the absence of $595 million of gains on the sales of the Collins businesses, in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of $178 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19 at Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins and an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, partially offset by a gain of $269 million on the sale of RIS&#8217;s global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining change was spread across multiple items with no common or significant driver. \n\nOperating Profit (Loss) ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating profit (loss) $ 5,414 $ 4,958 $ (1,889) Operating profit (loss) margin 8.1 &#160; % 7.7 % (3.3) % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in Operating profit (loss) of $0.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in Acquisition accounting adjustments, the operating performance at our operating segments and a decrease in Corporate and Eliminations and other, partially offset by the change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment, all of which are described below in &#8220;Segment Review.&#8221; \n\nThe change in Operating profit (loss) of $6.8 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our operating segments, including the impact of the Raytheon merger, the absence of the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins reporting units, and an increase in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $690 million primarily as a result of the Raytheon merger. Included in the increase in Operating profit was a decrease in restructuring costs of $625 million primarily related to 2020 restructuring actions taken at our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney segments and the absence of 2020 unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract \n\nTable of Contents \n\nasset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; below. \n\nNon-service Pension Income ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Non-service pension (income) $ (1,889) $ (1,944) $ (902) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe change in Non-service pension income of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of an increase in discount rates, partially offset by prior years&#8217; pension asset returns exceeding our expected return on plan assets (EROA) assumption. \n\nThe change in Non-service pension income of $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in the discount rates at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period, the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plan amendment described below and prior years&#8217; pension asset returns exceeding our EROA assumption. \n\nIn December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee&#8217;s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants&#8217; historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. \n\nInterest Expense, Net ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 1,300 &#160; $ 1,330 $ 1,430 Interest income (70) (36) (42) \n\nOther non-operating expense (income) (1) \n\n46 &#160; 28 (22) Interest expense, net $ 1,276 &#160; $ 1,322 $ 1,366 Total average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year: 4.0 &#160; % 4.1 % 4.0 % Total average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31: 4.0 &#160; % 4.0 % 4.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Primarily consists of the gains or losses on assets associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans, as well as the gains or losses on liabilities associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. \n\nInterest expense, net in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. \n\nInterest expense, net in 2021 was relatively consistent with 2020.

The increase in the FDII benefit from 2021 is primarily attributable to the capitalization of research or experimental expenditures for tax-purposes, enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effective beginning January 1, 2022. \n\nThe 2021 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $244 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in 2021, $172 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $121 million associated with FDII, and tax charges of $73 million associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the increase in the United Kingdom (U.K.) corporate tax rate to 25% enacted in 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded $148 million of tax charges associated with the sale of the Forcepoint business, and subsequently recognized a $104 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of that tax benefit as a result of completing the divestiture of RIS&#8217;s global training and services business for a gain in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.4 billion. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment, most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $416 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets and the revaluation of certain international tax incentives, and incremental tax expense of $177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of businesses at Collins, the airborne tactical radios business at RIS and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint. Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $83 million associated with FDII. \n\nFor additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221;

Effective as of that date, the historical results of the Carrier and Otis segments were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. See &#8220;Note 3: Discontinued Operations&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nLoss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners and the related change in diluted loss per share from discontinued operations in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. \n\nThe change in Loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $377 million and the related change in diluted loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.28 in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses, including debt extinguishment costs of $611 million, net of tax, in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, partially offset by prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. \n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareowners ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 5,197 &#160; $ 3,864 $ (3,519) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from operations $ 3.50 &#160; $ 2.56 $ (2.59) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe changes in Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners and diluted EPS from operations for 2022 compared to 2021 and for 2021 compared to 2020 were driven by the changes in continuing operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners and the changes from discontinued operations, as discussed above in Loss from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners. \n\nSEGMENT REVIEW \n\nWe operate in four principal business segments: Collins, Pratt &#38; Whitney, RIS and RMD. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The Company recently announced its intention to streamline the structure of its core businesses into three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt &#38; Whitney and Raytheon. The Company plans to determine the exact composition of each segment and implement the reorganization in the second half of 2023. All segment information included in this Form 10-K is reflective of the existing four segments of Collins, Pratt &#38; Whitney, RIS and RMD in accordance with the management structure in place as of December 31, 2022. \n\nFor a detailed description of our businesses, see &#8220;Business&#8221; within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. \n\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis. \n\nSegments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products \n\nTable of Contents \n\nand services. Segment Total Net Sales and Operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. \n\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221;. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt &#38; Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt &#38; Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s overall operating results. \n\nGiven the nature of our business, we believe that Total Net Sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management&#8217;s view of our segment performance, as described below. \n\nTotal Net Sales. Total Net Sales by segment were as follows: ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace $ 20,597 &#160; $ 18,449 $ 19,288 Pratt &#38; Whitney 20,530 &#160; 18,150 16,799 Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space 14,312 &#160; 15,180 11,069 Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense 14,863 &#160; 15,539 11,396 Total segment 70,302 &#160; 67,318 58,552 \n\nEliminations and other (1) \n\n(3,228) (2,930) (1,965) Consolidated $ 67,074 &#160; $ 64,388 $ 56,587 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021. \n\nOperating Profit (Loss). Operating profit (loss) by segment was as follows: ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace $ 2,343 &#160; $ 1,759 $ 1,466 Pratt &#38; Whitney 1,075 &#160; 454 (564) Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space 1,342 &#160; 1,833 1,020 Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense 1,519 &#160; 2,004 880 Total segment 6,279 &#160; 6,050 2,802 \n\nEliminations and other (1) \n\n(174) (133) (107) \n\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items (2) \n\n(318) (552) (590) FAS/CAS operating adjustment 1,520 &#160; 1,796 1,106 \n\nAcquisition accounting adjustments (3) \n\n(1,893) (2,203) (5,100) Consolidated $ 5,414 &#160; $ 4,958 $ (1,889) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021. \n\n(2) Includes the net expenses related to the U.S. Army&#8217;s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) project. \n\n(3) 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins reporting units. Refer to &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nIncluded in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit (loss) and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross favorable $ 1,368 &#160; $ 1,286 $ 994 Gross unfavorable (1,405) (1,176) (1,637) Total net EAC adjustments $ (37) $ 110 $ (643) ##TABLE_END\n\nAs a result of the Raytheon merger, RIS&#8217;s and RMD&#8217;s long-term contracts that are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis, were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented an obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term period following the merger, most notably in 2020. \n\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $147 million in 2022 compared 2021 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments of $183 million at RMD and $108 million at RIS, including the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, both spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver, and includes the impact of continued supply chain and labor market constraints. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $119 million at Collins, spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver, and a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $26 million at Pratt &#38; Whitney primarily due to a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. \n\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $753 million in 2021 compared 2020 was primarily due to a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $635 million at Pratt &#38; Whitney, due to the absence of significant unfavorable contract adjustments in 2020, and a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $126 million at RIS and $40 million at RMD, primarily due to the Raytheon merger. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in net EAC adjustments of $48 million at Collins spread across numerous individual programs with no individual or common significant driver. \n\nSignificant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment&#8217;s discussion below. \n\nBacklog and Defense Bookings. Total backlog was approximately $175 billion and $156 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our backlog by segment, which does not include intercompany backlog, was as follows at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in billions) 2022 2021 Collins Aerospace $ 25 &#160; $ 24 Pratt &#38; Whitney 100 &#160; 85 Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space 16 &#160; 18 Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense 34 &#160; 29 Total backlog $ 175 &#160; $ 156 ##TABLE_END\n\nIncluded in total backlog is defense backlog of $69 billion and $63 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our defense operations consist primarily of our RIS and RMD businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $47 billion, $40 billion and $31 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we reversed $1.3 billion of total backlog related to our sales contracts in Russia at Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins as discussed further in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nBacklog, which is equivalent to our RPO for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations as discussed further below. \n\nWe believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations&#8217; Total Net Sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period. Defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. \n\nDefense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). We reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, \n\nTable of Contents \n\ndirectly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs. \n\nCollins Aerospace ##TABLE_START % Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 \n\n2021 compared with 2020 \n\nNet sales $ 20,597 &#160; $ 18,449 $ 19,288 12 &#160; % (4) % Operating profit 2,343 &#160; 1,759 1,466 33 &#160; % 20 % Operating profit margins 11.4 &#160; % 9.5 % 7.6 % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared with 2021 ##TABLE_START &#160; Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) \n\nAcquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 2,384 $ (49) $ &#8212; $ (187) $ 2,148 Operating profit 724 (12) 19 (147) 584 ##TABLE_END\n\n2021 Compared with 2020 ##TABLE_START &#160; Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) \n\nAcquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ (574) $ (333) $ &#8212; $ 68 $ (839) Operating profit 653 (91) 320 (589) 293 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. \n\n2022 Compared with 2021 \n\nThe organic sales increase of $2.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $1.7 billion, including increases across all aftermarket sales channels, and higher commercial aerospace OEM sales of $1.0 billion, both principally driven by the recovery of commercial air traffic which has resulted in an increase in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization and narrow-body commercial OEM volume growth. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower material receipts and decreased volume. \n\nThe organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $1.2 billion principally driven by the higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales discussed above, partially offset by the absence of a favorable $52 million impact from a contract-related matter in 2021. The increase in commercial aerospace operating profit was partially offset by lower military operating profit of $0.2 billion principally driven by the lower military sales discussed above, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion, which includes the benefits of cost reduction initiatives. \n\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the disposition of two non-core businesses in the second quarter of 2022. \n\nThe decrease in Other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to $141 million of pretax charges related to increased estimates for credit losses, inventory reserves, recognition of purchase order obligations and a loss resulting from the exit of our investment in a Russia-based joint venture, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we recognized $69 million of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses in the second quarter of 2022. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 \n\nThe organic sales decrease of $0.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.8 billion, predominantly due to wide body volume declines principally driven by lower 787 deliveries. This was partially offset by higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in flight hours and aircraft fleet utilization as commercial aerospace continued to recover from the unfavorable economic environment principally driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Military sales were down slightly in 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.5 billion and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The higher commercial aerospace operating profit was principally driven by the higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales discussed above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, the absence of $157 million of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments, and a $52 million favorable impact from a contract-related matter in 2021. The significant unfavorable adjustments in 2020 were primarily driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain aircraft type. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the absence of a $125 million charge for allowances for credit losses in 2020, primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in organic profit in 2020 was $72 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19. \n\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of our Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020, as further discussed in &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nThe decrease in other operating profit of $0.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of prior year gains of $595 million on the sales of the Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses. \n\nPratt &#38; Whitney ##TABLE_START % Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 Net sales $ 20,530 $ 18,150 $ 16,799 13 &#160; % 8 % Operating profit (loss) 1,075 454 (564) 137 &#160; % 180 % Operating profit (loss) margins 5.2 &#160; % 2.5 % (3.4) % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared with 2021 ##TABLE_START &#160; Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) \n\nAcquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 2,478 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ (98) $ 2,380 Operating profit (loss) 773 &#8212; (13) (139) 621 ##TABLE_END\n\n2021 Compared with 2020 ##TABLE_START &#160; Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) \n\nAcquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 1,255 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 96 $ 1,351 Operating profit (loss) 702 &#8212; 173 143 1,018 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. \n\n2022 Compared with 2021 \n\nThe organic sales increase of $2.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.8 billion primarily due to an increase in shop visits and related spare part sales as the commercial aerospace environment continues to recover. The increase also includes higher commercial OEM sales of $0.9 billion driven by favorable mix and higher volume on commercial engine shipments. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.2 billion primarily due to lower sales on F135 production volume and lower volume on legacy aftermarket programs, partially offset by higher F135 sustainment volume. \n\nThe organic profit increase of $0.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $1.1 billion principally due to the aftermarket sales volume increase discussed above and favorable OEM mix. The organic profit increase also includes slightly higher military operating profit primarily driven by favorable mix. These increases were partially offset by a combined increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs of $0.3 billion. The year over year increase in commercial aerospace operating profit includes a $50 million favorable contract adjustment on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. In 2021, our organic profit included approximately $50 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19. \n\nThe decrease in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to $155 million of pretax charges related to impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, increased estimates for credit losses, \n\nTable of Contents \n\ninventory reserves and recognition of purchase order obligations, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia in the first quarter of 2022. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 \n\nThe organic sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.2 billion, primarily due to an increase in shop visits and related spare part sales driven by the recovery from the unfavorable economic environment largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher commercial OEM sales of $0.1 billion. Prior year commercial aftermarket sales include unfavorable EAC adjustments of $0.4 billion, discussed further below. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nThe organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.7 billion principally due to favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The higher commercial aerospace operating profit also includes the impact of the aftermarket sales volume increase discussed above, which was partially offset by lower commercial OEM operating profit due to unfavorable mix on the increased sales volume. The lower year-over-year unfavorable commercial aerospace EAC adjustments were principally driven by prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments including a $334 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on a commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period, an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract, and $86 million related to an unfavorable EAC adjustment and increased allowances for warranty for legacy fleet related retrofits. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the absence of a $257 million charge in 2020 for allowances for credit losses, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. The change in organic operating profit was also impacted by $106 million of lower government wage subsidies, and the absence of prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments on certain commercial aftermarket and military programs . \n\nThe increase in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets and $43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement, both recorded in 2020. \n\nDefense Bookings &#8211; In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2022 Pratt &#38; Whitney booked $4.9 billion for F135 production Lots 15, 16 and 17, $1.4 billion for F135 sustainment, $251 million for tanker production Lots 7 and 8 and $210 million for F117 sustainment. \n\nRaytheon Intelligence &#38; Space ##TABLE_START % Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 Net sales $ 14,312 $ 15,180 $ 11,069 (6) % 37 % Operating profit 1,342 1,833 1,020 (27) % 80 % Operating profit margins 9.4 &#160; % 12.1 % 9.2 % Bookings $ 12,391 $ 14,019 $ 10,568 (12) % 33 % ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared with 2021 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Factors Contributing to Total Change in Net Sales (dollars in millions) Organic (1) \n\nAcquisitions / Divestitures, net Other Total Change Net sales $ (184) $ (627) $ (57) $ (868) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; above for definition of organic.

The lower Command, Control and Communications sales were primarily driven by an anticipated decrease in production volumes on certain tactical communications systems programs. The higher Cyber, Training and Services sales were driven by certain classified cyber programs. The higher Sensing and Effects sales were primarily driven by an increase in sales on classified programs and an increase due to certain electro-optical development programs transitioning into production, partially offset by a decrease in surveillance and targeting systems due to lower production volume on certain legacy programs. \n\nThe decrease in operating profit of $0.5 billion and the related decrease in operating profit margins in 2022 compared to 2021, were primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.3 billion driven by the absence of a prior year $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of the global training and services business, as further discussed in &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K and acquisition / divestitures, net of $0.1 billion described below. \n\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 \n\nOrganic sales in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020. The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. \n\nThe increase in operating profit of $0.8 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020, were primarily due to the change in acquisitions / divestitures, net of $399 million, primarily due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, a favorable change in mix and other performance of $292 million primarily due to a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of RIS&#8217;s global training and services business in December 2021, as further discussed in &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the net favorable change in EAC adjustments of $132 million, which was primarily driven by the absence of $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments in 2020 for loss reserves related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in a net loss position. \n\nBacklog and Bookings &#8211; Backlog was $16 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $18 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2022, RIS booked $5.0 billion on a number of classified contracts, and a major award for a prototype Missile Track Custody system for the U.S. Space Force. RIS also booked $311 million on the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) GEO missile warning and defense contract for the U.S. Space Force, $271 million to provide communications satellite payloads to a commercial customer, and $253 million on the Development, Operations and Maintenance (DOMino) cyber program for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). \n\nRaytheon Missiles &#38; Defense ##TABLE_START % Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 Net sales $ 14,863 $ 15,539 $ 11,396 (4) % 36 % Operating profit 1,519 2,004 880 (24) % 128 % Operating profit margins 10.2 &#160; % 12.9 % 7.7 % Bookings $ 20,048 $ 15,650 $ 9,716 28 &#160; % 61 % ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\n2022 Compared with 2021 \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Factors Contributing to Total Change in Net Sales (dollars in millions) Organic (1) \n\nAcquisitions / Divestitures, net Other Total Change Net sales $ (628) $ &#8212; $ (48) $ (676) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See &#8220;Segment Review&#8221; above for definition of organic.

These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $0.4 billion from our Strategic Missile Defense programs. The decrease in Land Warfare and Air Defense programs includes lower sales on certain international air and missile defense programs primarily driven by lower material receipts as a result of supply chain constraints and anticipated decreases in production. The decrease in Air Power programs includes lower net sales on the Paveway program and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) program. The lower net sales in Naval Power programs was driven by lower volume across multiple programs, partially offset by higher net sales from SPY-6 programs. The increased sales in Strategic Missile Defense programs included higher net sales from the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program. \n\nThe decrease in operating profit of $0.5 billion and the related decrease in operating profit margins in 2022 compared to 2021 were primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of $0.3 billion and a net unfavorable change in EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion. The change in mix and other performance includes unfavorable program mix and a $42 million charge associated with a divestiture of a small non-core Naval Power business. The net unfavorable change in EAC adjustments was spread across numerous programs and includes the impact of continued supply chain and labor market constraints. \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 \n\nOrganic sales in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020. The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net relates to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. \n\nThe increase in operating profit of $1.1 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of $0.6 billion, primarily driven by the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million in 2020 related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a change in acquisitions / divestitures, net of $0.5 billion due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. \n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, RMD reversed $119 million of sales for work performed subsequent to the date of the Raytheon merger through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit, on our direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. Due to the U.S. presidential and congressional elections and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it was no longer probable that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for these contracts. RMD also recognized an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to these contracts, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBacklog and Bookings &#8211; Backlog was $34 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $29 billion at December 31, 2021. In 2022, RMD booked $3.5 billion on a number of classified contracts, including a strategic competitive award. RMD also booked $1.1 billion for the SPY-6 Hardware Production and Sustainment contract for the U.S. Navy, $1.0 billion to provide Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T) for an international customer, $1.0 billion for the first Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) for the U.S. Air Force, $972 million for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force and Navy and international customers, $762 million for AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy and Air Force and international customers, $698 million to provide National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) for Ukraine, $662 million on Stinger for the U.S. Army, $648 million for Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), $415 million on Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international customers, $405 million on a Surveillance Radar Program (SRP) for an international customer, $384 million for Excalibur Rapid Demonstration Phase 2 for the U.S. Army, $353 million for the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) Pre-planned Product Improvement program for the U.S. Army, $247 million on MIR replenishment for an international customer through our consolidated Raytheon-Rafael joint venture, $218 million to provide Patriot engineering support services for the U.S. Army and international customers, $217 million on Tomahawk for the U.S. Navy, $209 million for Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) Coastal Defense System (CDS) for the U.S. Navy, and $207 million for integrated effectors and sensors for Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) defense system for the U.S. Army. \n\nCorporate and Eliminations and other \n\nEliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments, including Forcepoint, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon merger and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021, as further discussed in &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs and certain other unallowable corporate costs not considered part of management&#8217;s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance including restructuring and merger costs related to the Raytheon merger, net costs associated with corporate research and development, including the LTAMDS program and certain reserves. \n\n##TABLE_START Net Sales Operating Profit (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Eliminations and other $ (3,228) $ (2,930) $ (1,965) $ (174) $ (133) $ (107) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#8212; (318) (552) (590) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in eliminations and other sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins and RIS. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. \n\nThe increase in eliminations and other sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 and an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by RIS. The change in eliminations and other operating profit in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021. \n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $234 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS project and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in information technology-related costs. \n\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $38 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in merger-related costs related to the Raytheon merger of $148 million and lower restructuring costs of $112 million, partially offset by an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD and an increase in net expenses related to the LTAMDS project. \n\nFAS/CAS operating adjustment \n\nThe segment results of RIS and RMD include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in \n\nTable of Contents \n\nconsolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins Aerospace and Pratt &#38; Whitney generally include FAS service cost. \n\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost, as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. \n\nThe components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 FAS service cost (expense) $ (365) $ (405) $ (354) CAS expense 1,885 &#160; 2,201 1,460 FAS/CAS operating adjustment $ 1,520 &#160; $ 1,796 $ 1,106 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $276 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by a $316 million decrease in CAS expense, partially offset by a $40 million decrease in FAS service cost. The decrease in CAS expense was primarily due to an increase in applicable discount rates as a result of U.S. qualified pension plan funding relief included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). \n\nThe change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $690 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by a $741 million increase in CAS expense, partially offset by a $51 million increase in FAS service cost. The increase in our CAS expense was primarily due to the Raytheon merger. \n\nIn December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee&#8217;s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants&#8217; historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. \n\nAcquisition accounting adjustments \n\nAcquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment. These adjustments are not considered part of management&#8217;s evaluation of segment results. \n\nThe components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Goodwill impairment charge $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; $ (3,183) Amortization of acquired intangibles (1,912) (2,404) (2,142) Amortization of property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment (89) (111) (69) Amortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts 108 &#160; 312 294 Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (1,893) $ (2,203) $ (5,100) ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nAcquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace $ (800) $ (641) $ (3,926) Pratt &#38; Whitney (243) (160) (117) Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space (303) (563) (394) Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense (547) (838) (607) Total segment (1,893) (2,202) (5,044) Eliminations and other &#8212; &#160; (1) (56) Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (1,893) $ (2,203) $ (5,100) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, is primarily driven by a decrease in RIS and RMD intangibles amortization related to the Raytheon merger, partially offset by the absence of $116 million of amortization of customer contractual obligations due to the accelerated liquidation of below-market contract reserves at Collins in 2021 driven by the termination of two customer contracts. \n\nThe change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $2.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, is primarily driven by the absence of the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins reporting units partially offset by an increase of $0.4 billion for acquisition accounting adjustments related to the Raytheon merger, primarily due to the timing of the merger in 2020.

Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.2 billion, of which approximately 34% was held by RTC&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company&#8217;s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTC will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. \n\nHistorically, our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $7.0 billion, consisting of a $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which expires in April 2025, and a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which was renewed in September 2022 and expires in September 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. \n\nFrom time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had $0.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022, which is reflected in Short-term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds from these borrowings have primarily been used to \n\nTable of Contents \n\nfund payments related to the impact of a provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requiring the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes. At December 31, 2022, short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4%. \n\nWe have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the Securities and E xchange Commission (SEC) on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. \n\nThe Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers&#8217; participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier&#8217;s decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows or overall liquidity. \n\nWe believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate. \n\nCash Flow - Operating Activities \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 7,168 &#160; $ 7,142 $ 4,334 Net cash flows used in operating activities from discontinued operations &#8212; &#160; (71) (728) ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared with 2021 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations \n\nCash flows provided by operating activities in 2022 were relatively consistent with 2021 and benefited from an improvement in working capital, which was more than offset by the net increase in tax payments resulting from a change in tax law discussed below. Included in the change in working capital was a favorable impact from accounts receivable driven by higher collections resulting from increased sales volume and a related increase in factoring as discussed below. The change in working capital also included a favorable impact from contract assets compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of billings and collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily driven by higher inventory purchasing activity, deferred revenue and advanced payments. This impact was largely offset by an unfavorable impact from inventory principally due to current year increases to support sales volume growth. \n\nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Higher sales volume in the current year supported increased factoring activity that resulted in approximately $2.3 billion of increased cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 , compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of $0.2 billion during 2021 . Factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers&#8217; request for which we may be compensated by the customer. \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations \n\nCash generated from operating activities in 2021 was $2.8 billion higher than 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher net income of $4.1 billion after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit, the goodwill impairment charge and debt extinguishment cost s, as well as lower pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $1.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to activity at the RIS and RMD segments in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the Raytheon merger. This unfavorable change in working capital at RIS and RMD includes a cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued liabili ties due to the timing of incentive compensation payments. Also included in the total unfavorable change in working capital was an increase in contract assets principally driven by sales in excess of billings at Pratt &#38; Whitney and contractual billing terms on U.S. government and foreign military sales contracts at RMD, and growth in accounts payable and accounts receivable at Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney due to an increase in sales volume as commercial aerospace recovered. \n\nFactoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2021, compared to a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2020. The year over year \n\nTable of Contents \n\nfavorable impact from factoring activity was primarily due to the significant decline in sales volume in 2020 principally driven by the economic environment primarily due to COVID-19. \n\nOperating Activities - Continuing Operations \n\nWe made pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $94 million, $59 million, and $1,025 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The contributions in 2020 include discretionary contributions of $801 million. We make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based on the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year&#8217;s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions. We can contribute cash or RTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2022, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTC shares was less than 1% of total plan assets. \n\nIn response to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the ARPA in March 2021, which included pension funding relief provisions. These provisions extended and expanded upon existing pension funding relief, most notably by increasing the liability interest rates used to determine the required cash contributions for our U.S. qualified pension plans. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in November 2021 further extended the interest rate pension funding relief provisions included in ARPA. Global pension and PRB cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately $0.4 billion in 2023, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the company. \n\nWe made net tax payments of $2.4 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. As this provision was not deferred legislatively, we have made incremental tax payments of $1.6 billion in 2022. \n\nIncluded in cash flows from operating activities are payments related to our operating lease obligations. See &#8220;Note 12: Leases&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations. \n\nIn addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. We expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $27.6 billion, of which $19.4 billion is payable in 2023. Purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. Approximately 50% of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses. \n\nOperating Activities - Discontinued Operations \n\nCash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2022 and 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $657 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of prior year separation costs as the Separation Transactions occurred in 2020. \n\nCash Flow - Investing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations $ (2,829) $ (1,364) $ 3,343 Net cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations &#8212; &#160; &#8212; (241) ##TABLE_END\n\nOur investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments. \n\n2022 Compared with 2021 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations \n\nThe $1.5 billion change in cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to the absence of 2021 investments in and dispositions of businesses, as discussed below. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations \n\nThe $4.7 billion change in cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of cash acquired in the Raytheon merger in 2020 of $3.2 billion, and investments in and dispositions of businesses, as discussed below. \n\nInvesting Activities - Continuing Operations \n\nThere were no material acquisitions in 2022. Investments in businesses in 2021 of $1.1 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of FlightAware at Collins and SEAKR Engineering Inc. at RIS. Investments in businesses in 2020 of $0.4 billion primarily related to the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies at RIS. For additional detail, see &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nThere were no material dispositions of businesses in 2022. Dispositions of businesses in 2021 of $1.9 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our Forcepoint business and the sale of our global training and services business within RIS. Dispositions of businesses in 2020 of $2.6 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses. For additional detail, see &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nCapital expenditures were $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures increased $154 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to investments in production facilities at Pratt &#38; Whitney. Capital expenditures increased $339 million in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to increases at RIS and RMD principally driven by the Raytheon merger and increases at Pratt &#38; Whitney. \n\nPayments on customer financing assets were $150 million, $231 million, and $280 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in payments in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool. The decrease in payments in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool, partially offset by increased customer financing. Receipts from customer financing assets were $179 million, $389 million and $368 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in receipts in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of the prior year sale and leaseback transaction. Receipts in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020, as both periods included similar sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of equipment. Refer to &#8220;Note 12: Leases&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these transactions. \n\nIn 2022, 2021, and 2020 we increased other intangible assets by approximately $487 million, $308 million, $312 million, respectively, which primarily relates to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce&#8217;s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets that are amortized over the term of the underlying economic benefit. At December 31, 2022, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments, of approximately $15.3 billion, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners&#8217; share. Refer to &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments. \n\nAs discussed in &#8220;Note 14: Financial Instruments&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 we had net cash payments of $205 million, $16 million, and $32 million, respectively, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. \n\nInvesting Activities - Discontinued Operations \n\nCash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2022 and 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $241 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the fact that the Separation Transactions occurred in 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCash Flow - Financing Activities \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations $ (5,859) $ (6,756) $ (3,860) Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities from discontinued operations &#8212; &#160; 71 (1,414) ##TABLE_END\n\nOur financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. \n\n2022 Compared with 2021 Financing Activities- Continuing Operations \n\nThe $0.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of 2021 repayments of long-term debt, including debt extinguishment costs, net of issuances of $0.8 billion and an increase in commercial paper borrowings, net of $0.7 billion, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of $0.5 billion, as discussed below. \n\n2021 Compared with 2020 - Financing Activities- Continuing Operations \n\nThe $2.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to an increase in share repurchases of $2.3 billion, as discussed below. In addition, in 2021, we had debt repayments, including debt extinguishment costs, of $4.9 billion and long-term debt issuances of $4.1 billion. \n\nFinancing Activities- Continuing Operations \n\nIncluded in cash flows from financing activities are payments related to our long term debt, including both interest and principal payments. A summary of our long-term debt commitments as of December 31, 2022 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Long-term debt&#8212;principal $ 588 $ 1,270 $ 1,590 $ 27,801 Long-term debt&#8212;future interest 1,257 1,220 1,193 14,552 ##TABLE_END\n\nOur share repurchases were as follows for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions; shares in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 $ Shares $ Shares $ Shares \n\nShares of common stock repurchased (1) \n\n$ 2,803 &#160; 29,943 &#160; $ 2,327 28,003 $ 47 330 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Relates to share repurchases that were settled in cash during the period. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $6.0 billion of our common stock under the December 12, 2022 share repurchase program. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law. \n\nOur Board of Directors authorized the following cash dividends for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Dividends paid per share of common stock $ 2.160 &#160; $ 2.005 $ 2.160 Total dividends paid $ 3,128 &#160; $ 2,957 $ 2,732 ##TABLE_END\n\nOn February 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.55 per share payable March 23, 2023 to shareowners of record at the close of business on February 24, 2023. \n\nFinancing Activities - Discontinued Operations \n\nCash flows provided by financing activities from discontinued operations in 2022 and 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $1.5 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the fact that the Separation Transactions occurred in 2020. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nPreparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management&#8217;s estimates. \n\nLong-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management&#8217;s judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company&#8217;s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management&#8217;s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation&#8217;s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of and changes to loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. \n\nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 152 &#160; $ 296 $ (407) Operating profit (loss) (37) 110 (643) \n\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) \n\n(29) 87 (508) \n\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) \n\n$ (0.02) $ 0.06 $ (0.37) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. \n\nAs a result of the Raytheon merger, Raytheon Company&#8217;s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date, because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term period following the merger, most notably in 2020. For additional information related to the Raytheon merger, see &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCosts incurred for engineering and development of certain aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract costs, and margin, considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2020, we recognized impairment of $111 million related to contract fulfillment costs in conjunction with the related impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic. \n\nIncome Taxes. Management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. \n\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing, and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. Management assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts, circumstances, applicable tax laws, including regulations, case law, and other interpretive guidance, as well as any other relevant information. Adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the Separation Transactions. We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; and &#8220;Note 13: Income Taxes&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nManagement has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in future reporting periods. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. \n\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2022, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $2.6 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $6.2 billion. We regularly assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our \n\nTable of Contents \n\nassumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows. \n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we utilize a combination of discounted cash flows (DCF) and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method. These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. \n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. For those reporting units where we performed a quantitative test, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of DCF and market-based valuation methodologies. As noted above, these methodologies involve significant assumptions that are subject to variability. The key assumptions used in our quantitative analysis include our business projections, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins, the long-term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit, the discount rate, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. We consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods. \n\nBased on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2022, the reporting units that were closest to impairment were two previously combined Collins reporting units with fair values in excess of book values, including goodwill, of 15% and 17%. The combined value of goodwill allocated to these two reporting units is approximately $9.5 billion as of the date testing was performed. All other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. The Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the significant assumptions noted above, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company&#8217;s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. \n\nIn 2020, we recognized goodwill impairments of $3.2 billion related to two Collins reporting units. Refer to &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. \n\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods. \n\nContingent Liabilities. As described in &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts, performance and operating cost guarantees, employee benefit plans, legal, and environmental, health and safety matter s. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance e stimates. These impacts could be material to the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. \n\nEmployee Benefit Plans. We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. They are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. A change in any of these assumptions \n\nTable of Contents \n\nor actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAssumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. Major assumptions include the discount rate and EROA. Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections. \n\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds, which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. \n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and PRB plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost and service cost as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps Projected benefit obligation increase (decrease) $ (1,144) $ 1,194 &#160; Net periodic benefit income increase (decrease) (23) 28 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income. \n\nThe EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. As a result of this analysis at year end 2022, our weighted average pension EROA assumption for 2023 increased to 7.1%. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon. \n\nNet periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2022 net periodic benefit income by approximately $139 million. \n\nRefer to &#8220;Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of current and prior year discount rate and EROA assumptions. \n\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nRefer to &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies. \n\nGOVERNMENT MATTERS \n\nAs described above in &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8212;Contingent Liabilities,&#8221; our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. See &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other government matters. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nOur primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments, which are primarily cash, debt and derivative instruments. To quantify our market risk exposure, we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Refer to &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,&#8221; &#8220;Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit&#8221; and &#8220;Note 14: Financial Instruments&#8221; within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange, interest rates and financial instruments. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing. We actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi tted foreign currency purchases and sales, and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level. More than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. Foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $11.2 billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of $0.9 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. \n\nWithin our aerospace business, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt &#38; Whitney Canada (P&#38;WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which U.S. Dollars will be converted. The majority of this hedging activity occurs at P&#38;WC and Collins, and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of Pratt &#38; Whitney. At P&#38;WC and Collins, firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the U.S. Dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of U.S. Dollar sales over U.S. Dollar denominated purchases. Hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations. \n\nInterest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $3 billion and $4 billion i mpact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \n\nMANAGEMENT&#8217;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \n\nThe management of RTC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \n\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of RTC&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework , released in 2013 . Management concluded that based on its assessment, RTC&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of RTC&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. \n\n##TABLE_START /s/ GREGORY J. HAYES Gregory J. Hayes President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ NEIL G. MITCHILL, JR. Neil G. Mitchill, Jr. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer /s/ AMY L. JOHNSON Amy L. Johnson Corporate Vice President and Controller ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Shareowners and Board of Directors of Raytheon Technologies Corporation \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion \n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s revenues of $67.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. The timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across the Company&#8217;s businesses due to their diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s revenues from the Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space and Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense segments are recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The Company&#8217;s revenues from certain long-term aftermarket contracts within its Pratt &#38; Whitney segment are recognized over the contract period as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. For these performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company&#8217;s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. Within the Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space and Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense segments, the variables and significant judgments relate to key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities for the contracts relate to management&#8217;s ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels and related variable consideration. Management also makes judgments about variables related to estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by the Company&#8217;s subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and the estimated cost of satisfying the Company&#8217;s industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts. Within the Pratt &#38; Whitney segment, the variables and significant judgments relate to current and past maintenance cost and frequency experience. Management reviews contract estimates at completion on a periodic basis and no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing their estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion, including significant judgments and assumptions on a contract by contract basis, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management&#8217;s estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion for contracts. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion, including evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant judgments and variables considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion involved evaluating whether the significant judgments and assumptions used were reasonable considering: (i) management&#8217;s historical forecasting accuracy, (ii) evidence to support the relevant aforementioned variables, (iii) the consistent application of accounting policies, and (iv) the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to a previous estimate. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments \n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s consolidated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets balances were $53.8 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. A portion of the total goodwill balance relates to certain reporting units of the Collins Aerospace segment. A portion of the total indefinite-lived intangible assets balance relates to the Collins Aerospace segment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on market-based valuation methods, income-based methods using a discounted cash flow model, relief from royalty methods, or a combination of such. These assessments utilize significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry. The impairment testing compares carrying values to estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of certain reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Collins Aerospace segment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry, as applicable, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Collins Aerospace segment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the fair value estimates, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodologies used to estimate fair value, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in developing the estimates, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to sales growth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry, as applicable. Evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions related to sales growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the relevant businesses, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s discounted cash flow, market-based valuation, and relief from royalty methods, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry assumptions. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nBoston, Massachusetts \n\nFebruary 6, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1947. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nRAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_START (dollars in millions, except per share amounts;

Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nSeparation Transactions, Distributions and Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation) completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies &#8211; UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (the Separation Transactions). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Distributions). Immediately following the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the Raytheon merger), pursuant to which Raytheon Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC, and UTC was renamed &#8220;Raytheon Technologies Corporation.&#8221; The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a continuing operations basis. Refer to &#8220;Note 3: Discontinued Operations&#8221; below for further details. \n\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;Raytheon Technologies,&#8221; and &#8220;RTC&#8221; mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. UTC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Raytheon merger and, as a result, the financial statements of Raytheon Technologies for the year ended December 31, 2020 include Raytheon Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. \n\nRussia Sanctions. In response to the Russian military&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. As a result of these sanctions on Russia and export controls, in the first quarter of 2022, we recorded pretax charges of $ 290 million, $ 210 million net of tax and the impact of noncontrolling interest, within our Collins Aerospace (Collins) and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses primarily related to increased estimates for credit losses on both our accounts receivables and contract assets, inventory reserves and purchase order obligations, impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable, and a loss on the exit of our investment in a Russia-based joint venture. Additionally, we reversed approximately $ 1.3 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO) in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 related to our sales contracts in Russia at Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins. We continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. \n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate. As a result of COVID-19, commercial air travel demand experienced an unprecedented downturn as governments, businesses and individuals reacted to the pandemic in ways such as lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, the adoption of remote working and decreased leisure travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses. In addition, the border closings, lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from COVID-19 negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities. Decreases in the availability of supplies, increases in the cost of supplies and delivery issues have caused shortages and delays for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies required for our performance, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, uncertainty continues with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. The pace of the commercial aerospace recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation, an economic downturn, or government budget deficits, among other factors, and may also be impacted by a resurgence of the pandemic and corresponding travel restrictions and protocols. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. \n\nIn 2020, we recorded write-downs of assets and significant unfavorable Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments in our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses primarily related to: \n\n&#8226; goodwill impairment charges of $ 3.2 billion related to two of our Collins reporting units. Refer to &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional information; \n\n&#8226; increased estimated credit losses on both our receivables and contract assets of $ 387 million; \n\n&#8226; an unfavorable EAC adjustment on a Pratt &#38; Whitney commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period of $ 334 million; \n\n&#8226; contract asset and inventory impairments at Collins due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity resulting from the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain commercial aircraft type of $ 146 million; \n\n&#8226; an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $ 129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract at Pratt &#38; Whitney; \n\n&#8226; an $ 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at Pratt &#38; Whitney; \n\n&#8226; the impairment of a Collins trade name of $ 57 million; \n\n&#8226; net unfavorable EAC adjustments on commercial aftermarket contracts at Pratt &#38; Whitney based on a change in estimated future customer activity of $ 75 million; \n\n&#8226; an unfavorable EAC adjustment at Pratt &#38; Whitney related to a shift in overhead costs to military contracts of $ 44 million; and \n\n&#8226; reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement at Pratt &#38; Whitney of $ 43 million. \n\nSummary of Accounting Principles. The following represents the significant accounting principles of Raytheon Technologies Corporation. \n\nConsolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, and all wholly owned, majority-owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For our consolidated non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable to us. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, the duration of our contracts or programs is utilized to define our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. Included within our Current assets and liabilities are Contract assets and liabilities related to our aftermarket and development arrangements, which can generally span up to fifteen years. \n\nWe reclassified certain immaterial prior period amounts within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to conform to our current period presentation. \n\nUse of Estimates. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. The estimated fair value of Cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities. \n\nAccounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. We are exposed to credit losses primarily on our accounts receivable and contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers. The allowance for expected credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer creditworthiness, historical payment and loss experiences, current economic conditions, including geographic and political risk, and the age and status of outstanding receivables. In certain circumstances, we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss experience and information. \n\nWe determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis, or when events and circumstances warrant. A credit limit is established for each \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncustomer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factors discussed above. In certain cases, we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk. \n\nExpected credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible. \n\nUnbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes unbilled receivables of $ 298 million and $ 342 million, respectively, which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factors beyond just the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nContract Assets and Liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing. \n\nContract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. \n\nContract assets and Contract liabilities are generally classified as current as our operating cycle is generally longer than one year. See &#8220;Note 6: Contract Assets and Liabilities&#8221; for further discussion of Contract assets and liabilities. \n\nAs described in more detail above in &#8220;Accounts Receivable,&#8221; we are exposed to credit losses on our contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers and regularly assess our allowance for expected credit losses as it relates to our Contract assets. \n\nInventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. \n\nValuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventoriable cost. Other factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part, overall market conditions, and other inventory management initiatives. Manufacturing costs are allocated to current production contracts. In our commercial aerospace businesses, excess costs beyond standard manufacturing costs are expensed when they meet certain thresholds. \n\nEquity Investments. Investments in entities we do not control are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For investments where we have significant influence, we apply the equity method of accounting, and as such, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is recorded. For investments where we do not have significant influence, we record them at cost under the measurement alternative and record adjustments for observable price changes. Equity investment income and losses are included in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. We evaluate our equity investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Our sales to and purchases from unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, which are considered related parties, are not material. \n\nCustomer Financing Assets . Customer financing assets (CFA) relate to our commercial aerospace businesses in which we provide financing to airline customers. Our financing predominantly relates to products under lease, and to a lesser extent, notes and lease receivables. In certain limited circumstances, we pay deposits on behalf of our airline customers to secure production slots with the airframers, and such pre-delivery payments are included in Accounts receivable, net, if current, and Customer financing assets, if non-current, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any unfunded pre-delivery payments are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitments as further discussed in &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies.&#8221; Interest income from notes and financing leases and rental income from operating lease assets is generally included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while gains or losses on sales of operating lease assets are included in Products sales and Cost of sales. The current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in CFA in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increases and decreases in CFA from funding, receipts and certain other activity, are generally reflected as Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Leased assets are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Notes and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected. For notes and lease receivables, we determine a specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with \n\nTable of Contents \n\nthe evaluation of credit risk and collectability. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the reserves related to CFA were not material. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any significant balances that are considered to be delinquent, on non-accrual status, past due 90 days or more, or considered to be impaired. \n\nFixed Assets, Net. Fixed assets, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. For asset sales or retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts. Gains and losses on sales of our Fixed assets, net, are generally recorded in operating income. \n\nBusiness Combinations. Once a business is acquired, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill. As required, a preliminary fair value is determined once a business is acquired, with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition. \n\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Rockwell Collins in 2018 and Goodrich in 2012, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Raytheon Company in 2020, we recorded assumed liabilities related to customer contractual obligations on certain contracts with economic returns that were lower than what could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date. We measured these assumed liabilities based on the estimated cash flows of the programs plus a reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants. These liabilities are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligations, as reflected by the expenses incurred on the contracts. The balance of the contractual obligations was $ 818 million and $ 929 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total consumption of the contractual obligations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 111 million, $ 314 million and $ 295 million, respectively, with future consumption expected to be as follows: $ 104 million in 2023, $ 80 million in 2024, $ 68 million in 2025, $ 67 million in 2026, $ 65 million in 2027 and $ 434 million thereafter. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on market-based valuation methods, income-based methods using a discounted cash flow model, relief from royalty methods, or a combination of such. These assessments utilize significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flows. \n\nIntangible assets consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, customer relationships, exclusivity assets, developed technology and other intangible assets including collaboration assets. Acquired intangible assets are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses over the applicable useful lives. Exclusivity assets are commercial aerospace payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. We classify amortization of such payments as a reduction of sales. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce&#8217;s ownership and collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE), additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments are being capitalized as collaboration assets and amortized to cost of sales. \n\nUseful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and the industry in which the intangible asset is used. These intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as represented by the underlying cash flows, which may result in an amortization method other than straight-line. For both our commercial aerospace collaboration assets and exclusivity arrangements, the pattern of economic benefit generally results in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning as programs enter full rate production and aftermarket cycles. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined or if straight- \n\nTable of Contents \n\nline amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit, a straight-line amortization method may be used. The range of estimated useful lives is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Years Collaboration assets 30 \n\nCustomer relationships and related programs 3 to 30 \n\nDeveloped technology 3 to 25 \n\nPatents and trademarks 5 to 30 \n\nExclusivity assets 5 to 25 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nLeases. As a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nWe enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space, vehicles, information technology equipment, and certain other equipment under both operating and finance leases. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, and use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate through market sources including relevant industry rates. Our lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentives received at or before the commencement date. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. We exclude variable payments from lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, to the extent such payments are not considered fixed, and instead, expense variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contracts are not a material component of lease expense. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nIn limited instances we act as a lessor, primarily for commercial aerospace engines, the majority of which are classified as operating leases. These leases are not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nOther Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the potential impairment of other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of other long-lived assets held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. \n\nIncome Taxes. Future income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. These amounts consist of the tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting balance sheets and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax paying component of a particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. I n the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management&#8217;s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. State income tax amounts are generally included in income tax expense; however state income tax payments related to our Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense (RMD) segments are generally recoverable through the pricing of products and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nservices to the U.S. government, and, accordingly, we have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets, current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, these state income taxes are generally allocated to contracts and then classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses when paid (recovered) or otherwise agreed as allocable with the U.S. government. \n\nWe have elected to account for tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI) as a period cost, as incurred. \n\nRevenue Recognition. The vast majority of our revenues are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while RIS and RMD primarily provide products and services to government customers in the defense industry. \n\nWe account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily contracts that are directly with a foreign government, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract contains multiple distinct units (such as engines or certain aerospace components) or spans multiple phases of the product life-cycle such as production, maintenance and support. A contract&#8217;s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost plus a margin approach. \n\nWe consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, contract incentive payments, estimates of award fees, flight hours, aircraft landings or other customer usage activities on long term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. When reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not. \n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. \n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point in time sales. \n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over-time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. \n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our RIS and RMD segments, and to a lesser extent Pratt &#38; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors&#8217; costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncontract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance. \n\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification. \n\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery. \n\nWe review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company&#8217;s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management&#8217;s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. \n\nChanges in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation&#8217;s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or \n\nTable of Contents \n\nmore of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of and changes to loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. \n\nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 152 &#160; $ 296 &#160; $ ( 407 ) Operating profit (loss) ( 37 ) 110 &#160; ( 643 ) \n\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) \n\n( 29 ) 87 &#160; ( 508 ) \n\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) \n\n$ ( 0.02 ) $ 0.06 &#160; $ ( 0.37 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. \n\nFor additional discussion on significant unfavorable EAC adjustments in 2020, see the COVID-19 Pandemic discussion above. \n\nAs a result of the Raytheon merger, Raytheon Company&#8217;s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date, because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term period following the merger, most notably in 2020. For additional information related to the Raytheon merger, see &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.&#8221; \n\nIn our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses, we may offer customers incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers, which are treated as a reduction in sales. \n\nIn our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses, we incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of aerospace products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers. Such costs generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. We capitalize these costs as contract fulfillment costs to the extent the costs are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortize the costs as the related performance obligations are satisfied. In instances where intellectual property does not transfer to the customer, we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classified in Other assets, current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment and recognized $ 111 million of impairment for contract fulfillment costs in 2020 in conjunction with the related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Costs to obtain contracts are not material. \n\nIn view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines and the large up-front investments required that often require returns generated over the full estimated life of the engine, Pratt &#38; Whitney has entered into certain collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs and risks are shared. Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangements are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts attributable to our collaborators for their share of sales are recorded as cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements based upon the terms and nature of the arrangement. Costs associated with engine programs under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from collaborators of their share of program costs is recorded as a reduction of the related expense item at that time. As of December 31, 2022, the collaborators&#8217; interests in all commercial engine programs ranged from 13 % to 49 %, inclusive of a portion of Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s interests held by other participants. Pratt &#38; Whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangements, with the exception of the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which provides aftermarket support, spare parts, and service for the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. There are no individually significant collaborative arrangements, and none of the collaborators individually have more than a \n\nTable of Contents \n\n25 % share in an individual program. The following table illustrates the Consolidated Statement of Operations classification and amounts attributable to transactions arising from the collaborative arrangements between participants for each period presented. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collaborator share of sales: Cost of sales - products $ 2,058 &#160; $ 1,534 &#160; $ 1,183 &#160; Cost of sales - services 1,808 &#160; 1,428 &#160; 1,374 &#160; Collaborator share of program costs (reimbursement of expenses incurred): Cost of sales - products ( 154 ) ( 160 ) ( 147 ) Research and development ( 182 ) ( 135 ) ( 177 ) Selling, general and administrative ( 105 ) ( 85 ) ( 99 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO). RPO represents the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price that is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $ 175 billion as of December 31, 2022. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we reversed approximately $ 1.3 billion of RPO related to our sales contracts in Russia due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia, as further discussed above. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2022, we expect approximately 25 % will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. Approximately 45 % of our RPO relates to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt &#38; Whitney, which are generally expected to be realized over a span of up to 15 years. \n\nResearch and Development. Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company&#8217;s portion in connection with cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred and recovery on these cost-sharing arrangements is recorded as a reduction to research and development expense as earned. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue generating contracts. \n\nForeign Exchange. We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in Shareowners&#8217; equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activity. We use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools by us and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We limit counterparty exposure and concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties. While there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements with various counterparties. However, we have not elected to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position. \n\nDerivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency commitments or forecasted commodity purchases may be accounted for as cash flow hedges, as deemed appropriate. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings as a component of products sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transa ction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. \n\nTo the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the foreign currency forward contracts are utilized as economic hedges and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which they occur. Cash \n\nTable of Contents \n\nreceipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additional information pertaining to foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedging is included in &#8220;Note 14: Financial Instruments.&#8221; \n\nEnvironmental. Environmental investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, including existing technology, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets, current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accrued environmental liabilities are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursements or potential recoveries from pursuing other parties. We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional details on the environmental remediation activities. \n\nPension and Postretirement Obligations. U.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans&#8217; projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans&#8217; assets. \n\nChanges to our pension and PRB plans&#8217; funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions or changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense. \n\nA calculated &#8220;market-related value&#8221; of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense. \n\nThe Company has elected to use the &#8220;corridor&#8221; approach in the amortization of gains and losses, which limits the expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan. \n\nNet periodic benefit (income) expense is classified between operating and non-operating, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension (income) expense. \n\nProduct Performance Obligations. We extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies for extended periods on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. Liability under such guarantees is based upon future product performance and durability. We accrue for such costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the agreements, and require management to consider factors such as the extent of future maintenance requirements, interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services. These cost estimates are largely based upon historical experience. See &#8220;Note 17: Guarantees&#8221; for further discussion. \n\nGovernment Grants. We may receive grants from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction. Grants are often structured to encourage investment, job creation, job retention, employee training, and other related activities. We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants are recorded as a reduction to the related expense or \n\nTable of Contents \n\nasset to which the grant relates or recorded in Other income, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Government grant transactions are not material to our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nAccounting Pronouncements. In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Liabilities &#8211; Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs, the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of the reporting period that the entity has confirmed as valid to the finance provider, where these obligations are recorded in the balance sheet, and a roll forward of the obligations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, on a retrospective basis, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement. \n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which requires business entities to make specific annual disclosures about transactions with a government. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our disclosures. \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer to apply the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination, rather than using fair value. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2022, we elected to early adopt the requirements of the new standard on a prospective basis. The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. \n\nOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2022 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nNOTE 2: BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nBusiness Acquisitions. Our investments in businesses, net of cash acquired, in 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $ 66 million, $ 1.1 billion and $ 35.1 billion, respectively. Our investments in business in 2022 consisted of immaterial acquisitions. Our investments in business in 2021 and 2020 primarily consisted of the acquisitions discussed below. \n\nIn November 2021, we completed the acquisitions of FlightAware and SEAKR Engineering Inc., for a total of approximately $ 1.1 billion, net of cash received. FlightAware is a leading digital aviation company providing global flight tracking solutions, predictive technology, analytics and decision-making tools, and is reported in the Collins segment. SEAKR Engineering Inc. is a leading supplier of advanced space electronics and is reported in the RIS segment. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded $ 0.8 billion of goodwill and $ 0.3 billion of intangible assets. \n\nIn December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies, a leading provider of small satellites and spacecraft systems components for $ 425 million, net of cash received. Blue Canyon Technologies is reported in the RIS segment. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $ 281 million of goodwill and $ 149 million of intangible assets. \n\nPro forma financial information and revenue from the date of acquisition have not been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate. \n\nRaytheon Merger. As discussed in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221;, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed an all-stock merger of equals, following the completion by UTC of the Separation Transactions and Distributions. Raytheon Company (previously New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): RTN) shares ceased trading prior to the market open on April 3, 2020, and each share of Raytheon common stock was converted in the merger into the right to receive 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock, previously traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;UTX.&#8221; Upon closing of the Raytheon merger, UTC&#8217;s name was changed to &#8220;Raytheon Technologies Corporation,&#8221; and its shares of common stock began trading as of April 3, 2020 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;RTX.&#8221; \n\nTotal consideration is calculated as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Amount Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 &#160; Fair value attributable to pre-merger service for replacement equity awards 99 &#160; Total merger consideration $ 33,166 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards is calculated as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts and exchange ratio) Amount Number of Raytheon Company common shares outstanding as of April 3, 2020 277.3 \n\nNumber of Raytheon Company stock awards vested as a result of the Raytheon merger (1) \n\n0.4 Total outstanding shares of Raytheon Company common stock and equity awards entitled to merger consideration 277.7 \n\nExchange ratio (2) \n\n2.3348 Shares of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards 648.4 \n\nPrice per share of RTC common stock (3) \n\n$ 51.00 &#160; Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents Raytheon Company stock awards that vested as a result of the Raytheon merger, which is considered a &#8220;change in control&#8221; for purposes of the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan. Certain Raytheon Company restricted stock awards and Raytheon Company restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, issued under the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan vested on an accelerated basis as a result of the Raytheon merger. Such vested awards were converted into the right to receive RTC common stock determined as the product of (1) the number of vested awards, and (2) the exchange ratio. \n\n(2) The exchange ratio is equal to 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock for each share of Raytheon Company common stock in accordance with the Raytheon merger agreement. \n\n(3) The price per share of RTC common stock is based on the RTC opening stock price as of April 3, 2020. \n\nAllocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired. We accounted for the Raytheon merger under the acquisition method and are required to measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquiree (Raytheon Company) at the fair values on the closing date. During the first quarter of 2021, based on the finalization of our valuation and internal reviews, we completed the purchase price allocation which resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $ 61 million. \n\nThe final purchase price allocation, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,208 &#160; Accounts receivable 1,997 &#160; Contract assets 6,023 &#160; Inventory 705 &#160; Other assets, current 940 &#160; Fixed assets 4,745 &#160; Operating lease right-of-use assets 950 &#160; Intangible assets 19,130 &#160; Other assets 1,218 &#160; Total identifiable assets acquired 38,916 &#160; Accounts payable 1,477 &#160; Accrued employee compensation 1,492 &#160; Other accrued liabilities 1,921 &#160; Contract liabilities 3,002 &#160; Long-term debt, including current portion 4,700 &#160; Operating lease liabilities, non-current 738 &#160; Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations 11,607 &#160; Other long-term liabilities 2,368 &#160; Total liabilities acquired 27,305 &#160; Total identifiable net assets 11,611 &#160; Goodwill 21,589 &#160; Redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 34 ) Total consideration transferred $ 33,166 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFair value adjustments to Raytheon Company&#8217;s identified assets and liabilities included an increase in fixed assets of \n\nTable of Contents \n\n$ 1.1 billion and an increase to future pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $ 3.6 billion, primarily related to remeasurement of the liability based on market conditions on the Raytheon merger closing date. In determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a review was conducted for any significant contingent assets or liabilities existing as of the closing date. The assessment did not note any material contingencies related to existing legal or government action. \n\nThe Separation Transactions included the transfer of certain defined benefit plans from UTC to Carrier and Otis. The plans transferred were primarily international plans with the majority of the UTC defined benefit liability remaining with Raytheon Technologies. Upon separation, the pension participants within Carrier and Otis were effectively terminated from Raytheon Technologies. The terminations triggered a mid-year remeasurement of the UTC domestic plans. The remeasurement, which was calculated using discount rates and asset values as of April 3, 2020 (using March 31, 2020 as a practical expedient), resulted in a $ 2.4 billion increase to our pension liability, primarily due to a decrease in the fair market value of the plans&#8217; assets since December 31, 2019. All service cost previously associated with Carrier and Otis was reclassified to discontinued operations. For non-service pension (income) expense and pension liabilities, generally only the portions related to the defined benefit plans transferred to Carrier and Otis as part of the Separation Transactions were reclassified to discontinued operations. \n\nThe fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets were determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation method, which is a form of the income approach. Under this approach, the estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are adjusted to exclude the future cash flows that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as tradenames or fixed assets. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective. Our estimates of market participant future cash flows, which required significant management judgment, included forecasted revenue growth rates, remaining developmental effort, operational performance including company specific synergies, program life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors. Where appropriate, the net cash flows were probability-adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, including cancellation rates related to backlog, government demand for sole-source and recompete contracts and win rates for recompete contracts, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future cash flows were then discounted to present value, using an appropriate discount rate that required significant judgment by management. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits we expect to realize over the estimated economic life of the underlying programs. The fair value of the tradename intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method, which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value, using forecasted revenue growth rate projections and a discount rate, respectively, that required significant judgment by management. The tradename intangible assets were determined to have an indefinite life. The developed technology intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits. \n\nThe intangible assets included above consist of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Fair Value Useful Life Acquired customer relationships $ 12,900 &#160; 25 years Acquired tradenames 5,430 &#160; Indefinite Acquired developed technology 800 &#160; 5 to 7 years \n\nTotal identifiable intangible assets $ 19,130 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe also identified customer contractual obligations on loss making programs and recorded liabilities of $ 222 million related to these programs based on the difference between the actual expected operating loss and a normalized operating profit. These liabilities are being liquidated based on the expected pattern of expenses incurred on these contracts. \n\nWe recorded $ 21.6 billion of goodwill as a result of the Raytheon merger which primarily relates to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce. The goodwill generated as a result of the Raytheon merger is nondeductible for tax purposes. \n\nMerger-Related Costs. Merger-related costs have been expensed as incurred. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded $ 17 million and $ 142 million, respectively, of Raytheon merger transaction and integration costs. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nSupplemental Pro-Forma Data. Raytheon Company&#8217;s results of operations have been included in RTC&#8217;s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the Raytheon merger had been completed on January 1, 2019. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of Raytheon Technologies with the stand-alone results of Raytheon Company for the pre-acquisition periods, which were adjusted to account for certain costs that would have been incurred during \n\nTable of Contents \n\nthis pre-acquisition period. The results below reflect Raytheon Technologies on a continuing operations basis, in order to more accurately represent the structure of Raytheon Technologies after completion of the Separation Transactions, the Distributions and the Raytheon merger. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 Net sales $ 64,087 &#160; Loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners ( 2,167 ) Basic loss per share of common stock from continuing operations $ ( 1.43 ) Diluted loss per share of common stock from continuing operations ( 1.43 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe unaudited supplemental pro-forma data above includes the following significant adjustments made to account for certain costs which would have been incurred if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2019, as adjusted for the applicable tax impact. As the merger was completed on April 3, 2020, the pro-forma adjustments in the table below only include the required adjustments through April 3, 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2020 \n\nAmortization of acquired Raytheon Company intangible assets, net (1) \n\n$ ( 270 ) \n\nAmortization of fixed asset fair value adjustment (2) \n\n( 9 ) \n\nUtilization of contractual customer obligation (3) \n\n8 &#160; \n\nDeferred revenue fair value adjustment (4) \n\n( 4 ) \n\nAdjustment to non-service pension (income) expense (5) \n\n239 &#160; \n\nRTC/Raytheon fees for advisory, legal, accounting services (6) \n\n134 &#160; \n\nAdjustment to interest expense related to the Raytheon merger, net (7) \n\n9 &#160; \n\nElimination of deferred commission amortization (8) \n\n5 &#160; $ 112 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Reflects the additional amortization of the acquired Raytheon Company&#8217;s intangible assets recognized at fair value in purchase accounting and eliminates the historical Raytheon Company intangible asset amortization expense. \n\n(2) Reflects the amortization of the fixed asset fair value adjustment as of the acquisition date. \n\n(3) Reflects the additional amortization of liabilities recognized for certain acquired loss making contracts as of the acquisition date. \n\n(4) Reflects the difference between prepayments related to extended arrangements and the fair value of the assumed performance obligations as they are satisfied. \n\n(5) Represents the elimination of unamortized prior service costs and actuarial losses, as a result of fair value purchase accounting. \n\n(6) Reflects the elimination of transaction-related fees incurred by RTC and Raytheon Company in connection with the Raytheon merger and assumes all of the fees were incurred during the first quarter of 2019. \n\n(7) Reflects the amortization of the fair market value adjustment related to Raytheon Company. \n\n(8) Reflects the elimination of amortization recognized on deferred commissions that are eliminated in purchase accounting. \n\nThe unaudited supplemental pro-forma financial information does not reflect the potential realization of cost savings related to the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro-forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2019, nor are they indicative of future results. \n\nDispositions. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 cash inflows related to dispositions were $ 94 million, $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively. Our dispositions of businesses in 2022 were immaterial. Our dispositions of businesses in 2021 and 2020 consisted of the dispositions discussed below and other immaterial dispositions. \n\nIn December 2021, we divested our global training and services business within our RIS segment for approximately $ 0.9 billion in cash and other consideration, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 251 million ($ 135 million after tax), which includes a $ 12 million pre-tax gain recognized in Non-service pension income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nIn January 2021, we sold our Forcepoint business for proceeds of $ 1.1 billion, net of cash transferred. We did not recognize a pre-tax gain or loss within the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the sale of Forcepoint. The results of Forcepoint were included in Eliminations and other in our segment results. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, in accordance with conditions imposed for regulatory approval of the Raytheon merger, we completed the sale of our Collins military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses for $ 2.3 billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 580 million ($ 253 million after tax), of which $ 608 million was included in Other income, net partially offset by $ 20 million of aggregate transaction costs included in \n\nTable of Contents \n\nSelling, general and administrative costs and an $ 8 million expense included in Non-service pension income within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nIn May 2020, in order to meet the requirements for regulatory approval of the Raytheon merger, we completed the sale of our airborne tactical radios business within our RIS segment for $ 231 million in cash, net of transaction-related costs. As the transaction occurred subsequent to the Raytheon merger, the gain of $ 199 million was not recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, but rather was recorded as an adjustment to the fair value of net assets acquired in the allocation of consideration transferred to net assets acquired in the Raytheon merger. \n\nGoodwill. Changes in our goodwill balances for the year ended in 2022 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Balance as of January 1, 2022 Acquisitions and Divestitures Foreign currency translation and other Balance as of December 31, 2022 Collins Aerospace $ 31,384 &#160; $ ( 36 ) $ ( 629 ) $ 30,719 &#160; Pratt &#38; Whitney 1,563 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,563 &#160; Raytheon Intelligence &#38; Space 9,813 &#160; 26 &#160; 2 &#160; 9,841 &#160; Raytheon Missiles &#38; Defense 11,659 &#160; 41 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,700 &#160; Total Segment 54,419 &#160; 31 &#160; ( 627 ) 53,823 &#160; Eliminations and other 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 17 &#160; Total $ 54,436 &#160; $ 31 &#160; $ ( 627 ) $ 53,840 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. \n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. For those reporting units where we performed a quantitative test, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. As noted above, these methodologies involve significant assumptions that are subject to variability. The key assumptions used in our quantitative analysis include our business projections, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins, the long-term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit, the discount rate, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. We consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods. \n\nBased on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2022, the reporting units that were closest to impairment were two previously combined Collins reporting units with fair values in excess of book values, including goodwill, of 15 % and 17 %. The combined value of goodwill allocated to these two reporting units is approximately $ 9.5 billion as of the date testing was performed. All other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. \n\nWe considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, net and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced significant unfavorable EAC adjustments at our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. In the second quarter of 2020, we evaluated the Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney reporting units for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying values of two of the six Collins reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flows, resulting in goodwill impairments of $ 3.2 billion. Goodwill impairment was not indicated for any of the other reporting units evaluated for impairment in any of these scenarios. \n\nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the significant assumptions noted above, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company&#8217;s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIntangible Assets. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortized: Collaboration assets $ 5,536 &#160; $ ( 1,408 ) $ 5,319 &#160; $ ( 1,173 ) Exclusivity assets 2,911 &#160; ( 323 ) 2,673 &#160; ( 318 ) Developed technology and other 1,202 &#160; ( 544 ) 1,214 &#160; ( 466 ) Customer relationships 29,775 &#160; ( 8,967 ) 29,982 &#160; ( 7,411 ) &#160; 39,424 &#160; ( 11,242 ) 39,188 &#160; ( 9,368 ) Indefinite-lived: Trademarks and other 8,641 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8,696 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total $ 48,065 &#160; $ ( 11,242 ) $ 47,884 &#160; $ ( 9,368 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary.

The pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response, including lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, remote working, facilities closures and reduced business and leisure travel, led to significant declines in demand for commercial air travel. The decrease in commercial air travel decreased demand for our commercial aerospace products and services of our Collins and Pratt &#38; Whitney businesses. Refer to &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles&#8221; for further details. While we have seen indications that commercial air travel is recovering, we continue to closely monitor our commercial aerospace assets for \n\nTable of Contents \n\nrecoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures.

We sponsor various employee savings plans. Our contributions to employer sponsored defined contribution plans were $ 1,037 million, $ 962 million and $ 875 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nOur non-union domestic employee savings plan for legacy UTC employees uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for employer matching contributions. External borrowings were used by the ESOP to fund a portion of its purchase of ESOP stock from us. The external borrowings have been extinguished and only re-amortized loans remain between RTC and the ESOP Trust. As ESOP debt service payments are made, common stock is released from an unreleased shares account. ESOP debt may be prepaid or re-amortized to either increase or decrease the number of shares released so that the value of released shares equals the value of plan benefit. We may also, at our option, contribute additional common stock or cash to the ESOP. \n\nShares of common stock are allocated to employees&#8217; ESOP accounts at fair value on the date earned. Cash dividends on common stock held by the ESOP are used for debt service payments. Participants may choose to have their ESOP dividends reinvested or distributed in cash. Common stock allocated to ESOP participants is included in the average number of common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS. At December 31, 2022, 24.7 million common shares had been allocated to employees, leaving 5.1 million unallocated common shares in the ESOP Trust, with a fair value of $ 512 million. \n\nPension and Postretirement Plans. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans that cover a large number of our employees. Our largest plans are generally closed to new participants. We also sponsor both funded and unfunded PRB plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our plans use a December 31 measurement date consistent with our fiscal year. \n\nRaytheon Company has both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. As of the merger date, the Raytheon Company plans were remeasured at fair value using accounting policies consistent with the UTC plans. Refer to &#8220;Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional information. The deferred pension and PRB plan losses included in Raytheon Company&#8217;s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the merger date were eliminated and are no longer subject to amortization in net periodic benefit (income) expense. Amounts prior to the merger date of April 3, 2020 do not include the Raytheon Company pension plan results. \n\nIn December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee&#8217;s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants&#8217; historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. We utilized a practical expedient and measured the plan assets and pension benefit obligations for the effected pension plans as of the nearest month end, December 31, 2020, resulting in a prior service credit of $ 2.1 billion. \n\nFor non-union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans, benefits for service up to December 31, 2014 are generally based on the employee&#8217;s years of service and compensation. Benefits for service after December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2019 are based on the existing cash balance formula that was adopted in 2003 for newly hired non-union employees and for non-union employees who made a one-time voluntary election to have future benefit accruals determined under this formula. In September 2019, we amended the UTC domestic defined benefit pension plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective December 31, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, these participants began receiving additional contributions under the UTC domestic defined contribution \n\nTable of Contents \n\nplan. Benefits for union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans are generally based on a stated amount for each year of service. \n\nWe made the following contributions to our pension and PRB plans&#8217; trusts during the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. qualified defined benefit plans $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 885 &#160; International defined benefit plans 69 &#160; 42 &#160; 125 &#160; PRB plans 25 &#160; 17 &#160; 15 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in 2020 include a $ 750 million discretionary contribution to the Raytheon Company U.S. qualified pension plans&#8217; trust.

International plans comprise 10 % and 11 % of the pension PBO as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are considered defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. \n\nIn addition to the pension and PRB noncurrent liabilities shown above, Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes other immaterial pension and PRB-related liabilities. \n\nInformation for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 22,116 &#160;

The PBO discount rate is used for the service cost and interest cost measurements for non-significant plans. \n\nMajor assumptions used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are presented in the following table as weighted-averages: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Benefit Obligation Net Periodic Benefit (Income) Expense 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 5.5 &#160; % 2.8 &#160; % 2.8 &#160; % 2.4 &#160; % 3.1 &#160; % Expected return on assets N/A N/A 5.7 &#160; % 5.7 &#160; % 5.7 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 5.0 &#160; % 4.7 &#160; % Ultimate health care cost trend rate 4.2 &#160; % 4.2 &#160; % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate health care cost trend rate 2029 2026 ##TABLE_END\n\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. \n\nIn determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. As a result of this analysis at year end 2022, our weighted average pension EROA assumption for 2023 increased to 7.1 %. \n\nPlan Assets. The plans&#8217; investment management objectives include providing the liquidity and asset levels needed to meet current and future benefit payments, while maintaining a prudent degree of portfolio diversification considering interest rate risk and market volatility. Globally, investment strategies generally target a mix of 40 % to 45 % of growth seeking assets and 55 % to 60 % of income generating and hedging assets using a wide set of diversified asset types, fund strategies and investment managers. The growth seeking allocation consists of global public equities in developed and emerging countries, private equity, real estate and multi-asset class strategies. Growth assets include an enhanced alpha strategy that invests in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign currency. Investments in private equity are primarily via limited partnership interests in buy-out strategies with smaller allocations to distressed debt funds. The real estate strategy is principally concentrated in directly held U.S. core investments with some smaller investments in international, value-added and opportunistic strategies. Within the income generating assets, the fixed income portfolio consists of mainly government and broadly diversified high quality corporate bonds. \n\nThe plans have continued their pension risk management techniques designed to reduce their interest rate risk. Specifically, the plans have incorporated liability hedging programs that include the adoption of a risk reduction objective as part of the long-term investment strategy. Under this objective the interest rate hedge is intended to increase as funded status improves. The \n\nTable of Contents \n\nhedging programs incorporate a range of assets and investment tools, each with varying interest rate sensitivities. The investment portfolios are currently hedging approximately 40 % to 80 % of the interest rate sensitivity of the pension plan liabilities, depending on the funded status of the plan. \n\nThe fair values of pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 by asset category are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Not Subject to Leveling (8) \n\nTotal Asset Category: Public Equities Global Equities $ 6,194 &#160; $ 5 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 6,199 &#160; Global Equity Commingled Funds (1) \n\n20 &#160; 568 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 588 &#160; Enhanced Global Equities (2) \n\n( 53 ) 75 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 22 &#160; Other Public Equities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,771 &#160; 5,771 &#160; \n\nPrivate Equities (3) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,068 &#160; 4,068 &#160; Fixed Income Securities Governments 2,526 &#160; 1,426 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,952 &#160; Corporate Bonds 1 &#160; 12,638 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 12,639 &#160; Structured Products \n\n&#8212; &#160; 57 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 57 &#160; Other Fixed Income &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,975 &#160; 6,975 &#160; \n\nReal Estate (4) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,650 &#160; 1,761 &#160; 3,411 &#160; \n\nOther (5) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 84 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,071 &#160; 3,155 &#160; \n\nCash &#38; Cash Equivalents (6) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 150 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 164 &#160; 314 &#160; Subtotal $ 8,688 &#160; $ 15,003 &#160; $ 1,650 &#160; $ 21,810 &#160; $ 47,151 &#160; Other Assets &#38; Liabilities (7) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 809 &#160; \n\nTotal at December 31, 2022 \n\n$ 47,960 &#160; Public Equities Global Equities $ 9,411 &#160; $ 6 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9,417 &#160; Global Equity Commingled Funds (1) \n\n3 &#160; 929 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 932 &#160; Enhanced Global Equities (2) \n\n46 &#160; 163 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 209 &#160; Other Public Equities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8,495 &#160; 8,495 &#160; \n\nPrivate Equities (3) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,490 &#160; 4,490 &#160; Fixed Income Securities Governments 1,933 &#160; 1,172 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,105 &#160; Corporate Bonds 1 &#160; 18,681 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 18,682 &#160; Structured Products \n\n&#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25 &#160; Other Fixed Income &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7,367 &#160; 7,367 &#160; \n\nReal Estate (4) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,885 &#160; 1,743 &#160; 3,628 &#160; \n\nOther (5) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 91 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,351 &#160; 5,442 &#160; \n\nCash &#38; Cash Equivalents (6) \n\n&#8212; &#160; 111 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 220 &#160; 331 &#160; Subtotal $ 11,394 &#160; $ 21,178 &#160; $ 1,885 &#160; $ 27,666 &#160; $ 62,123 &#160; Other Assets &#38; Liabilities (7) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; 1,200 &#160; \n\nTotal at December 31, 2021 \n\n$ 63,323 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents commingled funds that invest primarily in common stocks. \n\n(2) Represents enhanced equity separate account and commingled fund portfolios.

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. \n\nDerivatives in the plan are primarily used to manage risk and gain asset class exposure while still maintaining liquidity. Derivative instruments mainly consist of equity futures, interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency forward contracts. The fair market value of the plans&#8217; derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately $( 79 ) million and $ 98 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nWe review our assets at least quarterly to ensure we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. We employ a broadly diversified investment manager structure that includes diversification by active and passive management, style, capitalization, country, sector, industry and number of investment managers. No individual investment represented more than 5 % of the plan assets as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed due to the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Corporate Bonds Real Estate Total \n\nBalance, December 31, 2020 \n\n$ 2 &#160; $ 1,647 &#160; $ 1,649 &#160; Realized gains &#8212; &#160; 212 &#160; 212 &#160; Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period &#8212; &#160; 50 &#160; 50 &#160; Purchases, sales, and settlements, net &#8212; &#160; ( 24 ) ( 24 ) Transfers in/out, net ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) \n\nBalance, December 31, 2021 \n\n&#8212; &#160; 1,885 &#160; 1,885 &#160; Realized gains &#8212; &#160; 76 &#160; 76 &#160; Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period &#8212; &#160; 64 &#160; 64 &#160; Purchases, sales, and settlements, net &#8212; &#160; ( 211 ) ( 211 ) Transfers in/out, net &#8212; &#160; ( 164 ) ( 164 ) \n\nBalance, December 31, 2022 \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,650 &#160; $ 1,650 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nQuoted market prices are used to value investments when available. Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the last reported bid prices. Fixed income securities are primarily measured using a market approach pricing methodology, where observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar investments. Investment contracts are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations. Real estate investments are valued on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on an annual basis. \n\nThe fair market value of assets related to our PRB benefits was $ 302 million and $ 389 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These assets include $ 105 million and $ 147 million of which are invested in our domestic qualified pension plan trust at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remaining PRB investments are held within Voluntary Employees&#8217; Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The VEBA assets are generally invested in mutual funds and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. \n\nWe have set aside assets in separate trusts, which we expect to be used to pay for certain nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations in excess of qualified plan limits. These assets are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of marketable securities held in trusts as of December 31 was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Marketable securities held in trusts $ 774 &#160; $ 965 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNOTE 12: LEASES \n\nOperating lease expense was $ 475 million, $ 525 million, and $ 497 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 $ 1,458 &#160; $ 1,225 &#160; $ 1,347 &#160; Additions for tax positions related to the current year 106 &#160; 110 &#160; 125 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 23 &#160; 282 &#160; 323 &#160; Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 56 ) ( 49 ) ( 83 ) Settlements ( 16 ) ( 110 ) ( 48 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 439 ) Balance at December 31 $ 1,515 &#160; $ 1,458 &#160; $ 1,225 &#160; Gross interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits $ 34 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 50 &#160; Total accrued interest balance at December 31 190 &#160; 165 &#160; 141 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe unrecognized tax benefit table includes discontinued operations activity in 2020. \n\nAs a result of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions in April 2020, we transferred unrecognized tax benefits to Carrier and Otis of $ 439 million and associated interest of approximately $ 165 million. Pursuant to the terms of the separation agreements, certain other unrecognized tax benefits retained by the Company are subject to indemnification. \n\nThe 2020 additions for tax positions of prior years in the table above include amounts related to the Raytheon merger . \n\nWe conduct business globally and, as a result, Raytheon Technologies or one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012. \n\nThe Examination Division of the IRS is currently auditing Raytheon Technologies tax years 2017 and 2018 and pre-merger Raytheon Company tax years 2017, 2018 and 2019 as well as certain refund claims of Raytheon Company for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016 filed prior to the Raytheon merger. The examination phase of the audits for each of these tax years is expected to close in 2023. \n\nThe Examination Division of the IRS is also auditing pre-acquisition Rockwell Collins fiscal tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The examination phase of the audit for each of these tax years is expected to close during 2023. \n\nIt is reasonably possible that a net reduction within the range of $ 25 million to $ 375 million of unrecognized tax benefits may occur over the next 12 months as a result of the revaluation of uncertain tax positions arising from developments in examinations, in appeals, or in the courts, or the closure of tax statutes. \n\nNOTE 14: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nWe enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. \n\nThe present value of aggregate notional principal of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $ 11.2 billion and $ 8.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, all derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges will mature b y February 2030. Additional information pertaining to foreign exchange and hedging activities is included in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.&#8221; \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for derivative instruments as of December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 67 &#160; $ 59 &#160; Other accrued liabilities 347 &#160; 202 &#160; Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 17 &#160; $ 11 &#160; Other accrued liabilities 39 &#160; 11 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe effect of cash flow hedging relationships on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2022 and 2021 are presented in &#8220;Note 19: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss&#8221;. The amounts of gain or (loss) are attributable to foreign exchange contract activity and are primarily recorded as a component of Products sales when reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nThe Company utilizes the critical terms match method in assessing derivatives for hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, the hedged items and derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have &#8364; 500 million of euro-denominated long-term debt outstanding, which qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses, which is deemed to be effective. \n\nThe effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included within Other income, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and is not material. \n\nNOTE 15: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nThe following tables provide the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheet: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; (dollars in millions) \n\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 774 &#160; $ 713 &#160; $ 61 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative assets 84 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 84 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivative liabilities 386 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 386 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; (dollars in millions) \n\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 965 &#160; $ 890 &#160; $ 75 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative assets 70 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 70 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Derivative liabilities 213 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 213 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nValuation Techniques. Our derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties&#8217; credit risks. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties&#8217; credit risks. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table provides carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Customer financing notes receivables $ 169 &#160; $ 161 &#160; $ 195 &#160; $ 192 &#160; Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) 31,201 &#160; 28,049 &#160; 31,250 &#160; 35,828 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table provides the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are not carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Customer financing notes receivables $ 161 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 161 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) 28,049 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 28,003 &#160; 46 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Customer financing notes receivables $ 192 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 192 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) 35,828 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 35,778 &#160; 50 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of our Short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to their short-term nature, with commercial paper classified as level 2 and other short-term borrowings classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nNOTE 16: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \n\nPratt &#38; Whitney holds a 61 % program share interest in the International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration with MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC) and a 49.5 % ownership interest in IAE. IAE&#8217;s business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support of the V2500 engine program through involvement with the collaborators. Additionally, Pratt &#38; Whitney, JAEC and MTU are participants in the International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) collaboration, whose business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support for the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. Pratt &#38; Whitney holds a 59 % program share interest and a 59 % ownership interest in IAE LLC. IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest entities with Pratt &#38; Whitney as the primary beneficiary. IAE and IAE LLC have, therefore, been consolidated. The carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities for variable interest entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Current assets $ 7,609 &#160; $ 7,081 &#160; Noncurrent assets 779 &#160; 825 &#160; Total assets $ 8,388 &#160; $ 7,906 &#160; Current liabilities $ 9,154 &#160; $ 7,965 &#160; Noncurrent liabilities 19 &#160; 54 &#160; Total liabilities $ 9,173 &#160; $ 8,019 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 17: GUARANTEES \n\nWe extend a variety of financial, market value and product performance guarantees to third parties. These instruments expire on various dates through 2028. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain \n\nTable of Contents \n\noutstanding. A portion of our third party guarantees are subject to indemnification for our benefit for any liabilities that could arise. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the following financial guarantees were outstanding: \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Commercial aerospace financing arrangements $ 304 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 309 &#160; $ 3 &#160; Third party guarantees 335 &#160; 1 &#160; 511 &#160; 5 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nWe have made residual value and other guarantees related to various commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements. The estimated fair market values of the guaranteed assets equal or exceed the value of the related guarantees, net of existing reserves. Collaboration partners&#8217; share of these financing guarantees is $ 140 million and $ 141 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nWe also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations was $ 97 million and $ 120 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These primarily relate to environmental liabilities, which are included in our total environmental liabilities as further discussed in &#8220;Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies.&#8221; \n\nWe accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. \n\nWe also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant. The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance as of January 1 $ 1,157 &#160; $ 1,057 &#160; $ 1,033 &#160; Warranties and performance guarantees issued 264 &#160; 380 &#160; 311 &#160; Settlements ( 284 ) ( 272 ) ( 292 ) Other ( 28 ) ( 8 ) 5 &#160; Balance as of December 31 $ 1,109 &#160; $ 1,157 &#160; $ 1,057 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 18: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nExcept as otherwise noted, while we are unable to predict the final outcome, based on information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of any of the following matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nEnvironmental. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 798 million and $ 834 million, respectively, reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in &#8220;Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.&#8221; \n\nCommercial Aerospace Financing and Other Commitments. We had commercial aerospace financing commitments and other contractual commitments of approximately $ 15.3 billion and $ 15.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners&#8217; share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other \n\nTable of Contents \n\nfinancing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, or pay deposits on behalf of our customers to secure production slots with the airframers (pre-delivery payments). Our financing commitments with customers are contingent upon maintenance of certain levels of financial condition by the customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral and the credit worthiness of the customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded. \n\nWe also have other contractual commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. The estimated amount and timing of these payments, which are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in &#8220;Other commercial aerospace commitments&#8221; in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration partners in these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce&#8217;s ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in &#8220;Other commercial aerospace commitments&#8221; below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made. \n\nThe following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Committed 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Commercial aerospace financing commitments $ 4,559 &#160; $ 1,559 &#160; $ 1,405 &#160; $ 980 &#160; $ 556 &#160; $ 59 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Other commercial aerospace commitments 10,710 &#160; 1,147 &#160; 883 &#160; 794 &#160; 695 &#160; 717 &#160; 6,474 &#160; Collaboration partners&#8217; share ( 5,905 ) ( 915 ) ( 863 ) ( 714 ) ( 535 ) ( 331 ) ( 2,547 ) Total commercial aerospace commitments $ 9,364 &#160; $ 1,791 &#160; $ 1,425 &#160; $ 1,060 &#160; $ 716 &#160; $ 445 &#160; $ 3,927 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOther Financing Arrangements. We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations for us or our affiliates. We enter into these agreements to assist certain affiliates in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. The stated values of these letters of credit agreements and surety bonds totaled $ 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. \n\nOffset Obligations. We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of our offset agreements, both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to, had an outstanding notional value of approximately $ 11.3 billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. Historically, we have not been required to pay any penalties of significance. \n\nGovernment Oversight. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, we are now, and believe that, in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment, we will continue to be the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other \n\nTable of Contents \n\ndepartments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Congressional Committees. Other areas of our business operations may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agencies. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and in some cases has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have, from time to time, resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DOJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited. In addition, we accrue for liabilities associated with those matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon a range of estimates. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, then we accrue the minimum amount. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. \n\nTax Treatment of Carrier and Otis Dispositions. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in future reporting periods. \n\nLegal Proceedings. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various contract pricing disputes, government investigations and litigation matters across jurisdictions, updates to certain of which are set forth below. \n\nCost Accounting Standards Claims \n\nAs previously disclosed, in April 2019, a Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) of the United States DCMA asserted a claim against Pratt &#38; Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $ 1.73 billion plus interest ($ 843 million at December 31, 2022). The claim is based on Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s alleged noncompliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2019, due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts. Pratt &#38; Whitney believes that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on June 7, 2019. \n\nAs previously disclosed, in December 2013, a DCMA DACO asserted a claim against Pratt &#38; Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $ 177 million plus interest ($ 132 million at December 31, 2022). The claim is based on Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s alleged noncompliance with CAS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, due to its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts used in the calculation of material overhead costs for government contracts. In 2014, Pratt &#38; Whitney filed an appeal to the ASBCA. An evidentiary hearing was held and completed in June 2019. On November 22, 2021, the ASBCA issued its written decision sustaining in part and denying in part Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s appeal. The ASBCA rejected the DCMA&#8217;s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts, and ruled substantially in Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s favor on other liability issues. The ASBCA remanded the appeal to the parties for resolution of damages issues, which could require further proceedings at the ASBCA. On December 23, 2021, the DCMA filed a motion with the ASBCA seeking partial reconsideration of the November 22, 2021 decision. The motion for reconsideration was denied on August 29, 2022. On December 23, 2022, the DCMA filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to believe that the \n\nTable of Contents \n\nASBCA&#8217;s rejection of the DCMA&#8217;s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts is well supported in fact and law and likely will be sustained. In December 2018, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt &#38; Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2013 through 2017. This second claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA&#8217;s recent decision, demands payment of $ 269 million plus interest ($ 96 million at December 31, 2022). Pratt &#38; Whitney appealed this second claim to the ASBCA in January 2019. Although subject to further litigation at the ASBCA and potentially further litigation at the ASBCA and potentially further appellate proceedings, we continue to believe that the November 22, 2021 decision in the first claim will apply with equal legal effect to the second claim. Accordingly, we believe that the amounts demanded by the DCMA as set forth in the two claims are without legal basis and that any damages owed to the U.S. government for the two claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nThales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters \n\nAs previously disclosed, in 2019, Raytheon Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking information in connection with an investigation into whether there were improper payments made by Raytheon Company, our joint venture known as Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) or anyone acting on their behalf in connection with TRS or Raytheon Company contracts in certain Middle East countries since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the DOJ advised Raytheon Company it had opened a parallel criminal investigation. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC, seeking information and documents as part of its ongoing investigation. The Company maintains a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program, and continues to cooperate fully with the SEC&#8217;s and DOJ&#8217;s inquiries and to examine through our own investigation whether there were any improper payments or any such conduct that was in violation of Raytheon Company policy. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the SEC&#8217;s or DOJ&#8217;s inquiries. Based on the information available to date, however, we cannot reasonably estimate the range of any potential loss or impact to the business that may result, but do not believe that the results of these inquiries will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nDOJ Investigation, Contract Pricing Disputes and Related Civil Litigation \n\nAs previously disclosed, on October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company&#8217;s Missiles &#38; Defense (RMD) business since 2009. The investigation involves multi-year contracts subject to governmental regulation, including potential civil defective pricing claims for three RMD contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013. As part of the same investigation, on March 24, 2021, the Company received a second criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking documents relating to a different RMD contract entered into in 2017. We are cooperating fully with, and will continue to review the issues raised by the DOJ&#8217;s ongoing investigation. We continue to make substantial progress in our internal review of the issues raised by the DOJ investigation. Although we believe we have defenses to the potential claims, the Company has determined that there is a probable risk of liability for damages, interest and potential penalties and has accrued approximately $ 290 million for this matter. We are currently unable to estimate an incremental loss, if any, which may result when the DOJ investigation is complete. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe the results of the DOJ investigation or of any pending or potential civil litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nFour shareholder lawsuits were filed against the Company after the DOJ investigation was first disclosed. A putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the Company and certain of its executives alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misstatements in regulatory filings regarding internal controls over financial reporting in RMD. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were also filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the former Raytheon Company Board of Directors, the Company and certain of its executives, each alleging that defendants violated federal securities laws and breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in improper accounting practices, failing to implement sufficient internal financial and compliance controls, and making a series of false and misleading statements in regulatory filings. We believe that each of these lawsuits lacks merit. \n\nDarnis, et al. and Related Matter \n\nAs previously disclosed, on August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Company, Otis, Carrier, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors, and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors (Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al.). The complaint challenged the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to Company, Otis, and Carrier equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly-traded companies on April 3, 2020. The complaint also claimed that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity \n\nTable of Contents \n\ncompensation plans and also asserted claims under certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). On September 13, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which supersedes the initial complaint and continues to assert claims for breach of the equity compensation plans against the Company, Otis and Carrier, but no longer asserts ERISA claims. Further, no claim is made in the amended complaint against any current or former director of any of the three companies. Plaintiffs seek money damages, attorneys&#8217; fees and other relief. On September 30, 2022, in response to motions to dismiss filed by the Company, Otis and Carrier, the Court dismissed the class action in its entirety with prejudice. On October 26, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We continue to believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. On December 6, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain current and former members of its Board of Directors, alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in May 2020 by amending the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to certain Company equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly-traded companies. We believe that the lawsuit lacks merit. \n\nDOJ Grand Jury Investigation and Related Civil Litigation \n\nThe Company received a grand jury subpoena in late 2019, as part of a DOJ criminal investigation into purported agreements not to solicit or hire employees in violation of the federal antitrust laws. While the investigation has focused on alleged hiring restrictions between and among Pratt &#38; Whitney and certain of its suppliers of outsourced engineering services, the subpoena also included requests regarding Collins. Since receipt of the subpoena, the Company has been cooperating with the DOJ investigation. On December 15, 2021, a criminal indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, against a former Pratt &#38; Whitney employee and other employees of certain outsourced engineering suppliers charging each of them with one count of violating the federal antitrust laws. No current or former Collins employees were named in the indictment. We have been advised that the Company is a target of the DOJ investigation, and we continue to cooperate with the investigation. No criminal charge has been filed against the Company or its affiliates. \n\nAfter the criminal charges against the individuals were filed, numerous civil class action antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Pratt &#38; Whitney and other corporate and individual defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The allegations in each of the civil lawsuits track the factual assertions in the criminal indictment and generally allege that Pratt &#38; Whitney and the other defendants agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineers and skilled laborers in a manner that violated federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs in each of the civil lawsuits seek to represent different purported classes of engineers and skilled laborers employed by Pratt &#38; Whitney and other supplier-defendants since 2011. Plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits seek treble damages in an undetermined amount, plus attorneys&#8217; fees and costs of suit. All of the lawsuits have been consolidated and a single amended class action complaint was filed. We believe that the claims asserted lack merit. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nWhere appropriate, we have recorded loss contingency accruals for the above-referenced matters, and the amounts individually, or in the aggregate, are not material. \n\nOther. As described in &#8220;Note 17: Guarantees,&#8221; we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. \n\nWe also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also routinely defendants in, parties to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nNOTE 19: ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS \n\nA summary of the changes in each component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax is provided below: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) Foreign Currency Translation Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans Unrealized Hedging (Losses) Gains Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 3,211 ) $ ( 6,772 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 10,149 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 609 &#160; 1,842 &#160; 181 &#160; 2,632 &#160; Amounts reclassified, pre-tax &#8212; &#160; 373 &#160; 82 &#160; 455 &#160; Tax benefit (expense) 25 &#160; ( 510 ) ( 62 ) ( 547 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis, net of tax 3,287 &#160; 584 &#160; 4 &#160; 3,875 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 710 &#160; $ ( 4,483 ) $ 39 &#160; $ ( 3,734 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net ( 647 ) 3,210 &#160; ( 226 ) 2,337 &#160; Amounts reclassified, pre-tax &#8212; &#160; 258 &#160; ( 28 ) 230 &#160; Tax benefit (expense) ( 14 ) ( 813 ) 79 &#160; ( 748 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 49 &#160; $ ( 1,828 ) $ ( 136 ) $ ( 1,915 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net ( 1,050 ) 1,225 &#160; ( 246 ) ( 71 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax 2 &#160; 129 &#160; 103 &#160; 234 &#160; Tax benefit (expense) ( 6 ) ( 308 ) 48 &#160; ( 266 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 1,005 ) $ ( 782 ) $ ( 231 ) $ ( 2,018 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nAmounts reclassified that relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans include the amortization of prior service costs and actuarial net gains or losses recognized during each period presented. These costs are recorded as components of net periodic pension income for each period presented. See &#8220;Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans&#8221; for additional details. \n\nAll noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control (redeemable noncontrolling interests) are reported in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, between liabilities and equity, at the greater of redemption value or initial carrying value. \n\nNOTE 20: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nRTC&#8217;s long-term incentive plans authorize various types of market and performance based incentive awards that may be granted to officers and key employees. Certain historic awards remain outstanding under predecessor plans. The Raytheon Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (2018 LTIP) was approved by shareowners on April 26, 2021. A total of 134.8 million shares have been authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2018 LTIP including shares assumed from predecessor plans. There is also an additional 21.5 million shares for future issuance due to adjustments related to the Separation Transactions. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 81.2 million shares remain available for awards under the 2018 LTIP. The 2018 LTIP does not contain aggregate annual award limits, however, it sets an annual award limit per participant. The 2018 LTIP will expire after all authorized shares have been awarded or April 26, 2031, whichever is sooner. \n\nUnder the 2018 LTIP, the exercise price of awards is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. Generally, stock appreciation rights and stock options have a term of ten years and a three-year vesting period, subject to limited exceptions. In the event of retirement, annual stock appreciation rights, stock options, and RSUs held for more than one year may become vested and exercisable, subject to certain terms and conditions. LTIP awards with performance-based vesting generally have a minimum three-year vesting period and vest based on actual performance against pre-established metrics. In the event of retirement, performance-based awards held for more than one year, remain eligible to vest based on actual performance relative to performance goals. We have historically repurchased shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements and will continue to evaluate this policy in conjunction with our overall share repurchase program. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, at fair value on the grant date and recognize this cost in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, net of expected forfeitures, as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total compensation cost recognized $ 420 &#160; $ 442 &#160; $ 330 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe associated future income tax benefit recognized was $ 91 million, $ 83 million and $ 63 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 20 million, $ 7 million and $ 15 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $ 32 million, $ 42 million and $ 48 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the associated tax benefit realized from the vesting of performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock awards and RSUs was $ 80 million, $ 44 million and $ 58 million, respectively. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, there was $ 329 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity awards granted under long-term incentive plans. This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. \n\nA summary of the transactions under our long-term incentive plans for the year ended December 31, 2022 follows. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Stock Options Stock Appreciation Rights Performance Share Units Restricted Stock and RSUs (shares and units in thousands) Shares Average Price (1) \n\nShares Average Price (1) \n\nUnits Average Price (2) \n\nUnits Average Price (1) \n\nOutstanding at: December 31, 2021 1,849 &#160; $ 78.36 &#160; 33,061 &#160; $ 78.62 &#160; 1,265 &#160; $ 73.75 &#160; 11,443 &#160; $ 66.18 &#160; Granted 102 &#160; 94.04 &#160; 3,225 &#160; 94.06 &#160; 990 &#160; 96.15 &#160; 3,441 &#160; 97.76 &#160; Exercised / earned ( 283 ) 70.20 &#160; ( 3,827 ) 70.53 &#160; ( 1 ) 80.53 &#160; ( 4,476 ) 62.03 &#160; Cancelled ( 11 ) 94.04 &#160; ( 427 ) 86.34 &#160; ( 104 ) 85.06 &#160; ( 651 ) 78.38 &#160; December 31, 2022 1,657 &#160; $ 80.67 &#160; 32,032 &#160; $ 81.04 &#160; 2,150 &#160; $ 83.52 &#160; 9,757 &#160; $ 78.40 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Weighted-average exercise price. \n\n(2) Weighted-average grant date fair value. \n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 21.80 , $ 15.60 and $ 23.37 , respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share units, which vest upon achieving certain performance metrics, granted during 2022 and 2021 was $ 96.15 and $ 73.75 , respectively. There were no performance share units granted in 2020. The total fair value of awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 346 million, $ 287 million and $ 284 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price on the date of exercise) of stock options and stock appreciation rights exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 110 million, $ 54 million and $ 206 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the stock price at vesting multiplied by the number of underlying shares) of performance share units and other restricted awards vested was $ 427 million, $ 256 million and $ 295 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe following table summarizes information about equity awards outstanding that are vested and expected to vest as well as equity awards outstanding that are exercisable at December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Equity Awards Vested and Expected to Vest Equity Awards That Are Exercisable (shares in thousands; aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Awards Average Price (1) \n\nAggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) \n\nAwards Average Price (1) \n\nAggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) \n\nStock Options 1,654 &#160; $ 80.61 &#160; $ 34 &#160; 5.36 1,182 &#160; $ 77.13 &#160; $ 28 &#160; 4.47 Stock Appreciation Rights 31,896 &#160; 81.01 &#160; 635 &#160; 5.56 22,118 &#160; 77.68 &#160; 514 &#160; 4.52 Performance Share Units 2,105 &#160; 83.41 &#160; 212 &#160; 1.48 Restricted Stock and RSUs 9,417 &#160; 78.02 &#160; 950 &#160; 1.54 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Weighted-average exercise price per share. \n\n(2) Weighted-average contractual remaining term in years. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The following table indicates the assumptions used in estimating fair value for awards granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020. Lattice-based option models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs; those ranges are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Expected volatility 27.9 % \n\n29.9 % \n\n18.8 % \n\nWeighted-average volatility 28 &#160; % 30 &#160; % 19 &#160; % Expected term (in years) 6.5 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.5 \n\nExpected dividend yield 2.2 &#160; % 2.6 &#160; % 1.9 &#160; % Risk-free rate 0.02 % - 2.1 % \n\n0.04 % - 1.2 % \n\n1.4 % - 1.6 % \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nExpected volatilities are based on the returns of our stock, including implied volatilities from traded options on our stock for the binomial lattice model. We use historical data to estimate equity award exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected term represents an estimate of the period of time equity awards are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of equity award grant. \n\nNOTE 21: SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA \n\nOur operations, for the periods presented herein, are classified into four principal segments: Collins, Pratt &#38; Whitney, RIS and RMD. The segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operating companies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The Company recently announced its intention to streamline the structure of its core businesses into three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt &#38; Whitney and Raytheon. The Company plans to determine the exact composition of each segment and implement the reorganization in the second half of 2023, at which time management will begin to manage its operations under its new segment structure. The changes will require the Company to revise its segment reporting. All segment information included in this Form 10-K is reflective of the existing four segments of Collins, Pratt &#38; Whitney, RIS and RMD in accordance with the management structure in place as of December 31, 2022. \n\nCollins Aerospace is a leading global provider of technologically advanced aerospace and defense products and aftermarket service solutions for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and regional, business and general aviation, as well as for defense and commercial space operations.

Total sales and operating profit by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales. \n\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different.

      "text": " ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Corporate Vice President and Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"

SARs and stock options are not full-value awards and will result in a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the Plan on a one-for-one basis. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"
