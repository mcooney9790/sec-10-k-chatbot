BUSINESS \n\nDescription of Business \n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $44.3 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $1.8 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2022. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784. \n\nWe divide our businesses into three principal business segments: Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth Management. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits. \n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon&#8217;s lines of business, products and services, see the &#8220;Overview,&#8221; &#8220;Summary of financial highlights,&#8221; &#8220;Fee and other revenue,&#8221; &#8220;Review of business segments&#8221; and &#8220;International operations&#8221; sections in the MD&#38;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the &#8220;Available Information&#8221; section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon. \n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are: \n\n&#8226; The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and \n\n&#8226; BNY Mellon, National Association (&#8220;BNY Mellon, N.A.&#8221;), a national bank, which houses \n\nour Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses. \n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon. \n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law. \n\nBNY Mellon&#8217;s banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). &#160; The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (&#8220;BNY Mellon SA/NV&#8221;) is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism and is also supervised by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for conduct of business rules. BNY Mellon SA/NV has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France. BNY Mellon SA/NV&#8217;s activities are in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management. For additional discussion, see the &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section in the Annual Report. \n\nPrimary Subsidiaries \n\nExhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K presents a list of BNY Mellon&#8217;s primary subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 2022. \n\nBNY Mellon 5 \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nOur enduring ambition is to build the best global team&#8212;one that is inclusive of varying perspectives, backgrounds and experiences, and represents the increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our core objective is to empower our teams to do their best work, make unique contributions and build purposeful careers in an equitable environment where they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is integral to who we are as a company, what our people experience as members of our global team, and how we serve all of our stakeholders. Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is not separate, but embedded in our business strategy, operating model, talent experience and client value proposition. \n\nTo increase the diversity of our talent pool, we work with professional associations, educational institutions, think tanks and nonprofits to deepen engagement with Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, LGBT+, neuro-diverse individuals, people with disabilities, and talent from other underrepresented backgrounds. We aim for fair inclusion by using diverse candidate slates, creating gender-neutral job descriptions and involving diverse interview panels. We embed diversity, equity and inclusion in our talent review processes, succession plans and development objectives to improve promotion readiness and advance and retain talent from all backgrounds. \n\nAt the most senior level, our Executive Committee sets diversity, equity and inclusion goals with specific targets to improve senior leader diversity and to increase female representation globally and diverse ethnic and/or racial representation in the U.S. Executive Committee members&#8217; variable compensation is informed by performance against these goals. \n\nAt the end of 2022, women were 40% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s global workforce and 43% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s U.S. workforce. Further, 38% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s U.S. workforce were from U.S. underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. \n\nAt the end of 2022, 35% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s Executive Committee were women and 20% of BNY Mellon&#8217;s \n\nExecutive Committee were from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. \n\nOur Board of Directors is committed to fostering and maintaining its diversity. At the end of 2022, 36% of our Board of Directors were women and 36% of our Board of Directors was composed of individuals from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. In addition, four of BNY Mellon&#8217;s six standing committees of its Board of Directors are chaired by a diverse director based on race or gender. \n\nRetention, Training and Development \n\nWe seek to attract and retain employees by providing a rewarding employee experience. We recognize that employees seek a supportive, safe and inclusive workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to meet those expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, and other defined contribution retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with market practice. We also maintain defined benefit plans for certain current and former employees, some of which are frozen (including in the U.S.). At Dec. 31, 2022, we had approximately 43,700 participants in our 401(k) plan, including former employees. In addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan covered approximately 8,100 U.S. participants and our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen) covered approximately 15,700 non-U.S. participants. \n\nIn December 2022, BNY Mellon announced that it would provide eligible employees an award of 10 restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) on Feb. 13, 2023. This equity grant will allow eligible employees to become equity owners and share in the Company&#8217;s success. \n\nAt key career transition points, from internship to executive management, we offer programs and development opportunities to help employees advance their careers and progress within our organization. Our extensive training and development opportunities are designed to enable employees to grow professionally and advance within our organization. \n\nWe engage with employees to encourage innovation, show appreciation for their contributions, and gather feedback on how we can build a more rewarding, inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly gather feedback through an all-employee survey. \n\n6 BNY Mellon \n\nEmployee Wellbeing, Health and Safety \n\nBNY Mellon&#8217;s holistic approach to employee wellbeing is designed to create a healthy, resilient and vibrant workforce. Our programs are designed to provide employees easy access to resources to help improve their physical health, emotional resilience, financial wellbeing and social connections. Further, we work to ensure the safety of our employees and clients in all of our facilities. \n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, we quickly transitioned the vast majority of our employees to working from home. We found new ways of working and collaborating to deliver on our commitments to clients and each other. Beginning in 2022, we transitioned to a new model which fosters flexibility. We endeavor to promote a collaborative and effective workplace for our people, while continuing to embrace the concept of flexibility and enhancing our culture and commercial impact. \n\nEmployees and International Operations \n\nGlobally, at Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries had approximately 51,700 full-time employees. \n\nWe pride ourselves on providing dedicated service through our multilingual sales, marketing and client service teams. At Dec. 31, 2022 , approximately 50% of our total employees (full-time and part-time employees) were based outside the U.S., with approximately 10,600 employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;), approximately 16,100 employees in the Asia-Pacific region (&#8220;APAC&#8221;) and approximately 900 employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil. \n\nSupervision and Regulation \n\nInformation on the supervision and regulation of BNY Mellon can be found in the &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\nCompetition \n\nBNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust \n\nservices, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. \n\nCompetition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, and as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. \n\nFor additional discussion regarding competition, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Strategic Risk &#8211; We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Operational Risk &#8211; Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees&#8221; in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with participation by the members of the Disclosure Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized and reported and that information required to be disclosed by BNY Mellon is accumulated and communicated to BNY Mellon&#8217;s management to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our ethics hotline can be used by employees and others for the anonymous communication of concerns about financial controls or reporting matters. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. \n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2022, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
