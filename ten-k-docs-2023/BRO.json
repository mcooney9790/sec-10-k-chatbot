B usiness. \n\nGeneral \n\nBrown &#38; Brown is a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and service organization with origins dating from 1939 and is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Company markets and sells insurance products and services, primarily in the property, casualty and employee benefits areas. We provide our customers with quality, non-investment insurance contracts, as well as other targeted, customized risk management products and services. We primarily operate as an agent or broker and therefore, with limited exceptions, do not assume underwriting risks. Within The Wright Insurance Group, LLC (&#8220;Wright&#8221;), we operate a write-your-own flood insurance carrier, Wright National Flood Insurance Company (&#8220;WNFIC&#8221;). WNFIC&#8217;s underwriting business consists of policies written pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program (&#8220;NFIP&#8221;), the program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;), excess flood and private flood policies which are fully reinsured, thereby substantially eliminating WNFIC&#8217;s exposure to underwriting risk, as these policies are backed by either FEMA or a reinsurance carrier with an AM Best Company rating of &#8220;A&#8221; or better. We also participate in capitalized captive insurance facilities (the &#34;Captives&#34;) for the purpose of providing additional capacity to place coverage, deliver revenues, and participate in underwriting results. The Company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. The Captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to underwriting claim costs. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain managing general agents. The Captives limit, but do not fully eliminate the Company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by only participating in limited tranches of the underwriting results. \n\nThe Company is compensated for its services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, by fees paid directly by customers for certain services. Commission revenues are generally a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and typically depend upon the type of insurance, the particular insurance company and the nature of the services provided by us. In some limited cases, we share commissions with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly with us in a transaction and we recognize commissions net of any commissions paid to other intermediaries. We may also receive from an insurance company a profit-sharing contingent commission, which is a supplemental commission based primarily on underwriting results. Fee revenues are generated by: (i) our Services segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and other claims adjusting services, (ii) our National Programs and Wholesale Brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers, and (iii) our Retail segment for fees received in lieu of commissions or for other services provided. The amount of our revenues from commissions and fees is a function of several factors, including continued new business production, retention of existing customers, acquisitions and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units, which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our activities were conducted in 345 domestic locations in 46 states, and 150 international locations in Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Cayman Islands, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. \n\nSegment Information \n\nOur business is divided into four reportable segments: (i) the Retail segment, (ii) the National Programs segment, (iii) the Wholesale Brokerage segment and (iv) the Services segment. The Retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public entities, and to professional and individual customers, as well as non-insurance warranty services and products through our F&#38;I businesses. The National Programs segment, which acts as a managing general agent (&#8220;MGA&#8221;), provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through a nationwide network of independent agents, including Brown &#38; Brown retail agents, as well as affinity groups, wholesale entities and sold direct to consumers. The Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through a nationwide network of independent agents and brokers, including Brown &#38; Brown retail agents. The Services segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and adjusting services, comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services and Social Security disability benefits advocacy services. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table summarizes (i) the commissions and fees generated by each of our reportable operating segments for 2022, 2021, and 2020 and (ii) the percentage of our total commissions and fees represented by each segment for each such period: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nRetail segment \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,081.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n58.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,766.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n58.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,471.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n56.5 \n\n% \n\nNational Programs segment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n858.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n701.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n23.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n609.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n23.4 \n\n% \n\nWholesale Brokerage segment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n452.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n402.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n352.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n13.5 \n\n% \n\nServices segment \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n171.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n178.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n174.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.7 \n\n% \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(&#8212; \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(0.1 \n\n)% \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,563.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,047.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,606.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe majority of our operations are in the United States. Outside of the United States we have retail operations based in Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, wholesale brokerage operations based in the Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom and a managing general agent operation in Canada and the United Kingdom. These operations generated $240.6 million, $78.0 million and $35.1 million of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not have any material foreign long-lived assets. \n\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for additional segment financial data relating to our business. \n\nRetail segment \n\nThe Retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public, professional and individual insured customers, and non-insurance services and products through our automobile dealer services F&#38;I businesses.

During 2022, commissions and fees from our largest single Retail segment customer represented 0.5% of the Retail segment&#8217;s total commissions and fees. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Retail segment employed 9,185 employees. Our Retail segment has physical locations in 42 states and Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In connection with selling and marketing of insurance coverages, we provide a broad range of related services to our customers, such as risk management strategies, loss control surveys and analysis, consultation in connection with placing insurance coverages and claims processing. \n\n&#160; \n\nNational Programs segment \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our National Programs segment employed 3,008 employees. The National Programs segment specializes in the development and management of insurance program business, often designed for niche, underserved markets and distributes these coverages to retail insurance agencies (including Brown &#38; Brown retail offices), as well as affinity groups, wholesale entities and sold direct to consumers. Our largest National Programs segment customer represented approximately 7.6% of the segment's total commissions and fees. We offer program management expertise for insurance carrier partners across numerous lines of business, which can be grouped into five broad categories as detailed below: \n\n&#160; \n\nProfessional programs. Professional liability and related package insurance products are tailored to the needs of professionals in the following areas: dentistry, legal, eyecare, insurance, financial, physicians and real estate title professionals. Professional liability programs also offer supplementary insurance-related products to include weddings, events, medical facilities and cyber liability. \n\n&#160; \n\nPersonal Lines programs. Personal lines programs offer a variety of insurance products to personal lines consumers including homeowners and personal property policies; residential earthquake; private passenger automobile and motorcycle coverage, which is currently in run-off. \n\n&#160; \n\nCommercial Lines programs. Specific industries and market niches are served by our commercial programs including automotive aftermarket, professional and amateur sports, special events and the entertainment industry; commercial transportation and trucking; forestry; manufactured housing; and workers&#8217; compensation. The Arrowhead Core Commercial program which covered a broad segment of industries is currently in run-off. \n\n&#160; \n\nPublic Entity programs. Public entity programs range from providing fully insured programs to establishing risk retention insurance pools, and excess and facultative specific coverages, including administration of various insurance trusts for cities, counties, municipalities, school boards, special taxing districts and quasi-governmental agencies. \n\n&#160; \n\nSpecialty programs. Specialty programs include flood insurance, commercial difference-in-conditions (earthquake), all-risk commercial property, limited exposure captives, coastal property programs including wind, lender-placed solutions, sovereign native-American nations and parcel insurance. \n\nWholesale Brokerage segment \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Wholesale Brokerage segment employed 1,687 employees. Our Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance products and services to retail insurance agencies (including Brown &#38; Brown retail offices). The Wholesale Brokerage segment represent various U.S., U.K., and European surplus lines insurance companies. Additionally, certain offices are also Lloyd&#8217;s of London correspondents. The Wholesale Brokerage segment also represents admitted insurance companies for purposes of affording access to such companies for smaller agencies that otherwise do not have access to large insurance company representation. Excess and surplus insurance products encompass many insurance coverages, including personal lines, homeowners, yachts, jewelry, commercial property and casualty, commercial automobile, garage, restaurant, builder&#8217;s risk and inland marine lines. Difficult-to-insure general liability and products liability coverages are a specialty, as is excess workers&#8217; compensation coverage. During 2022, commissions and fees from our largest Wholesale Brokerage segment customer represented approximately 1.4% of the Wholesale Brokerage segment&#8217;s total commissions and fees. \n\nServices segment \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Services segment employed 991 employees and provided a wide range of insurance-related services. \n\nBelow are brief descriptions of the capabilities within the Services segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nSocial Security Advocacy and Advisory. Social Security advocacy assists individuals throughout the United States who are seeking to establish eligibility for coverage under the federal Social Security Disability program and provides health plan selection and enrollment assistance for Medicare beneficiaries. We work closely with employer sponsored group life, disability and health plan participants to assist disabled individuals in receiving the education, advocacy and benefit coordination assistance necessary to achieve the fastest possible benefit approvals. In addition, we provide second injury fund recovery services to the workers&#8217; compensation insurance market. \n\n&#160; \n\nClaims Administration. Claims administration provides third-party administration (&#8220;TPA&#8221;) services for commercial and personal property and casualty, medical, vocational, and professional liability insurance markets on a nationwide basis, providing claims adjusting, administration, subrogation, litigation and data management, claims investigations services, claim investigations, and audit services to insurance companies, self-insureds, public municipalities, insurance brokers and corporate entities. We source claims activity from various Arrowhead programs in our National Programs segment, as well as from third parties. \n\n&#160; \n\nMedicare Secondary Payer compliance and Medicare Set-Aside. Medicare secondary payer compliance and Medicare Set-aside provides statutory compliance services, conditional payment negotiation and resolution, structured settlements/annuity funding, professional administration and a post-settlement durable medical equipment and pharmacy program administration. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSelf-Insured Trust Administration. Self-insured trust administration provides TPA services for government entities and self-funded or fully-insured workers&#8217; compensation and liability plans and trusts including claims administration and a dedicated subrogation recovery department. \n\n&#160; \n\nWorkers&#8217; Compensation and Liability Plan Administration. Workers&#8217; compensation and liability plan administration provides claims administration, cost containment consulting services for secondary disability and subrogation recoveries, certified and non-certified medical management programs, access to medical networks, case management, utilization review services and risk management services such as loss control. \n\nIn 2022, our five largest contracts represented approximately 22.4% of fees revenues in our Services segment. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive, and numerous firms actively compete with us for customers and insurance markets. Competition in the insurance business is largely based upon innovation, knowledge, understanding of terms and conditions of coverage, quality of service and price. A number of firms with substantially greater resources and market presence compete with us. \n\nA number of insurance companies directly sell insurance, primarily to individuals or small enterprises, and as a result do not pay commissions to third-party agents and brokers. In addition, internet and startup technology companies continue to be a source for direct placement of personal lines or small business insurance. We have our own technology capabilities to also serve personal lines and small businesses. While it is difficult to quantify the impact on our business from individuals or small businesses purchasing insurance over the internet, we believe this risk would generally be isolated to personal lines customers with single-line coverage, or small businesses that do not have a complex insurance program, which represent a small portion of our overall Retail or National Programs segments. \n\nRegulation, Licensing and Agency Contracts \n\nWe and/or our designated employees must be licensed to act as agents, brokers, intermediaries or third-party administrators by regulatory authorities in the locations in which we conduct business. Regulations and licensing laws vary by individual state and international location and are often complex. \n\nThe applicable licensing laws and regulations in all states and international jurisdictions are subject to amendment or reinterpretation by regulatory authorities, which in most cases have broad discretion as to the granting, revocation, suspension and renewal of licenses. We endeavor to monitor the licensing status of our employees, but the possibility exists that we and/or our employees could be excluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities in a particular jurisdiction in addition to being subjected to fines. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had 15,201 employees globally. We have agreements with our sales employees and certain other employees that include provisions that (i) protect our confidential information and trade secrets, (ii) restrict their ability post-employment to solicit the business of our customers, and (iii) prevent them from hiring of our employees for a period of time after separation from employment with us. The enforceability of such agreements varies from state to state depending upon applicable law and factual circumstances. The majority of our employment relationships are at-will and terminable by either party at any time; however, the covenants regarding confidential information and non-solicitation of our customers and employees generally extend for a period of at least two years after cessation of employment. \n\nNone of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. \n\nOur Guiding Principles \n\nThe cornerstones of our organization's guiding principles are people, performance, service and innovation. We view ourselves as a team and refer to our employees as &#8220;teammates.&#8221; We believe in always doing what is best for our customers, communities, teammates, carrier partners and shareholders. We understand that every successful team thrives on the diversity of talent, thought, experience, character and work ethic. Our ability to continue to serve our customers and communities is dependent on the effective recruitment and enhancement of the most qualified teammates. We are an equal opportunity employer built on meritocracy, meaning our teammates have the opportunity to rise according to their merits and individual initiative. \n\nCulture \n\nAt Brown &#38; Brown, we have a culture built on integrity, innovation, superior capabilities, discipline and meritocracy. Our commitment to doing what is best for our customers drives our sales culture and is a crucial component in our Company's strategy. We operate as a lean, highly competitive, decentralized growth and profit-oriented sales and service organization. Our teammates are our greatest resource, and by challenging, empowering and rewarding them, our teams are driven to achieve extraordinary results. \n\n&#160; \n\nOver 20% of our Company is owned by teammates, which we believe cultivates a unique ownership culture. We strive to provide multiple opportunities for teammates to share in the ownership of Brown &#38; Brown and to help create personal wealth, including through our employee stock purchase program, our 401(k) plan, and long-term equity grants. With more than 60% of our teammates owning stock in our Company, we operate with an ownership mindset that influences how we invest in our business and the work we do for our customers. \n\nOur Team \n\nOur goal is to provide our teammates with long-term careers, which is why a vast majority of our teammates are full-time teammates. In addition, we also employ regular part-time teammates and seasonal/temporary teammates. \n\nFull-time teammates work at least a 30-hours per week for an indefinite period of time and are generally eligible for all employment benefits provided by the Company. Part-time teammates work less than 30 hours per week for an indefinite period of time, and depending on the average hours worked per week, they may be eligible for limited employment benefits as specified in terms of the particular benefit plan or policy. Seasonal/temporary teammates are hired as an interim replacement to temporarily supplement our workforce or assist in completing a specific project, other than those supplied under contract by an outside agency; employment assignments in this category are typically of limited duration. \n\nTeammate Recruitment, Education and Development \n\nOur Company focuses on recruiting and developing the most capable teammates with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We actively recruit at all offices and levels of our organization. We have seen good success over time by building our diverse team with recent college graduates, mid-level professionals with experience outside the insurance industry and seasoned insurance professionals who desire to elevate their careers. Leveraging our strong relationships with several key colleges and universities, we are also committed to recruiting and developing talent through our college intern program. In addition to individual recruitment, we focus on building our team by completing high-quality acquisitions. In 2022, we grew our team by almost 2,800 new teammates through the acquisition of 30 companies. \n\nWe believe that supporting and encouraging continued education will help to ensure we remain at the forefront of developing trends in an ever-changing industry. We are committed to investing heavily in our teammate education and development through Brown &#38; Brown University (&#34;BBU&#34;), the Brown &#38; Brown Education Assistance Program and our Peer Partnership Program. \n\nTeammate Benefits \n\nBrown &#38; Brown offers a wide variety of benefits, including medical and dental coverage, short-term and long-term disability, life insurance and a 401(k) plan. We strive to have comprehensive benefit offerings, as we believe the overall well-being of our teammates and their families comes first, and having competitive benefits helps set us apart in recruiting and retaining high-quality talent. \n\nIn 2022, there were no widespread layoffs or pay reductions as a result of external factors, such as the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters. Instead, our Company's leadership remains committed to developing our talented teammates and focusing on engagement, which we believe over time supports strong financial results. Our Company has encouraged flexible work arrangements to accommodate the evolving future of the work landscape and the needs of our teammates. Additionally, teammates affected in 2022 by the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters, including Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole, had the opportunity to apply for financial assistance through our Brown &#38; Brown Disaster Relief Foundation. \n\nTeammate Engagement \n\nTo better understand our Company's strengths and growth opportunities, we gather anonymous feedback from our entire team on at least an annual basis. We are committed to actively listening and amplifying our teammates' well-being, satisfaction and engagement at work, and are proud that in 2022, 93% of our teammates say Brown &#38; Brown is a Great Place to Work&#174;. By instilling A Meritocracy culture, we want teammates to have the opportunity to rise according to their merits. \n\nWe believe a driver of our Company&#8217;s results stem from our commitment to putting the health and well-being of our teammates and their families first. By valuing and supporting these priorities as an organization, we believe our Company will continue to be driven by positive, engaged and productive teams, and will retain the most talented teammates. \n\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging \n\nWe believe having a team that is diverse in thought, experience, skills and work ethic, results in teammate empowerment and high performance. An empowered team helps to positively impact our customer service and community involvement. As part of our strategy, we continue to evolve and augment our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (&#34;DIB&#34;) task force, which was established in 2020. The DIB team is composed of numerous teammates and leaders with different backgrounds, work experiences and skill sets. The mission of the task force is to provide an environment to foster the collection of ideas, thoughts and stories that help further develop a strategic framework of promoting diversity, inclusion and belonging. The task force is overseen and guided by our chief people officer. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur DIB task force spent the past several years evaluating our Company's current strengths and opportunities for development by initiating teammate surveys, listening sessions, group focus sessions and training modalities, including a course for all teammates focused on understanding and managing unconscious bias. In 2022, the task force established four Teammate Resource Groups (&#34;TRG&#34;s) that are each founded around one identity. Each TRG meets internally, empowers one another, host events, and is expected to make recommendations on how our Company can improve policies, impact recruitment and continue to be a strong part of the community. As a way to offer teammates flexibility to observe any day during the year to recognize their culture or heritage, in 2021, our task force introduced an additional floating holiday known as Culture Day. \n\nBrown &#38; Brown does not tolerate discrimination in any form concerning any aspect of employment. The Company has an established a policy that recruitment, hiring, transfers, promotions, terminations, compensation and benefits practices be without regard to race, color, religion, absence of religious affiliation, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, perception of disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, gender orientation, marital status, service in our armed forces, veteran status in our armed forces, political activity or political party affiliation. In addition, the Company monitors the representation of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities, because we believe diversity helps us build better teams, facilitate innovation and improve our customer experience. We discuss our gender and minority profile periodically with our board of directors. We are proud of our efforts in this area and continue to strive to further diversify our workforce and strengthen our culture. \n\nTeammate Health and Well-being \n\nThe safety and well-being of all Brown &#38; Brown teammates and customers are of utmost importance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we navigated the pandemic by carefully executing our business continuity plan. We prioritized the health and well-being of our teammates to support the welfare of our customers, carrier partners and shareholders. The Brown &#38; Brown team demonstrated resiliency in a time of uncertainty, and through &#8220;The Power of WE,&#8221; navigated this uncharted territory with minimal interruption to our business. We know we must remain prepared to deal with future pandemics. Our response has formed the basis for preparedness if another dangerous and contagious disease should arise. \n\nBeginning in March 2020, the Company implemented a telecommuting protocol in response to COVID-19. Since then, remote work has provided an important layer of safety and flexibility. Hybrid workforce models have now been embraced by most of our teams, as they offer flexibility within our workforce and enable the Company to attract more geographically diverse talent. \n\nBrown &#38; Brown's top priority is the total well-being of our teammates, which means physical, emotional, social and financial health and wellness. We know that healthy teammates provide better support to their families, their communities and our customers, which results in our continued success as a Company. We encourage teammates to stay active, maintain a healthy work-life balance, volunteer in their local communities and prioritize their mental and physical health. This includes regular communication with teammates about the importance of physical, mental and financial wellness. In addition, our chief executive officer shares biweekly video updates to connect with our teammates and encourage the importance of health and well-being. \n\nOur Company encourages individuals to engage in activities that promote good mental health and, when needed, to seek out help from friends, teammates, family and medical professionals. \n\nMany of the services readily available to Brown &#38; Brown teammates are bundled under the Company&#8217;s Teammate Assistance Program. These include no-cost, confidential support services such as access to mental health counselors, a 24/7 crisis hotline, coaching, wellness activities, a library of videos and webinars on demand and more. The Company provides a crisis hotline &#8220; Advocate for Me ,&#8221; a service that provides one-on-one consultation with mental well-being case navigators, therapists and psychiatrists, alongside other programs. \n\nIn 2021, we announced the creation of a Mental Health Allies group, which consists of a group of teammate volunteers that are ready to serve as points of contact for our mental health resources, as well as a support system for our teammates. Mental Health Allies complete mental health first aid training offered by the National Council for Behavioral Health. These teammates are available to listen impartially and support teammates, while also raising awareness regarding the importance of mental health and wellness. Mental Health Allies are not diagnosticians or emergency providers, but rather conduits who may assist teammates find the appropriate resources in a time of need. \n\nIn addition, our new campus in Daytona Beach, Florida, completed in 2021, was designed with teammates in mind. Open floorplans encourage regular movement and interaction among our teammates, promoting a productive, collaborative work environment. Offices and workstations are equipped with ergonomic furniture and sit-stand desks, intentionally selected to support teammates' physical health. Many of our other offices are also embracing open floorplans as they enter into new leases or refresh their office space. \n\nWe continue to engage our team of employed health care professionals to provide critical and timely guidance on the physiological and psychological implications of COVID-19. We also provide access to public COVID-19 resources through our website portal to benefit individuals and businesses coping with challenges resulting from the pandemic. \n\nTo assist those who have found themselves in financial hardships, we provide discounted services and products through our Brown &#38; Brown $avings Center to both teammates and the public. \n\nWorkplace Safety \n\n&#160; \n\nAcross all Brown &#38; Brown locations, our goal is to provide a safe environment for teammates and office visitors. The Company has formal workplace safety guidelines that apply to our teammates and facilities, with some offices establishing even more specific procedures for conduct. These guidelines cover, among other things, hazardous and unsafe work areas and conditions, cellphone usage, travel, attire, communication protocols for closures and emergencies and our workers' compensation benefits. \n\nAdditionally, the Company has a formal policy against violence in the workplace. This policy prohibits any form of weapon from being carried or maintained in our Company's offices and prohibits teammates from making threats or engaging in violent activities. Under our policy, any teammate who believes they have been a victim of violence, threats of violence, intimidating conduct or has heard jokes or offensive comments about a violent occurrence must report such actions immediately to their team leader or another member of our Company's leadership team. In addition, any teammate who believes they or another teammate may be in imminent danger of violence must notify local law enforcement officials immediately. \n\nIn 2022, the Company had no work-related fatalities and 24 injuries or occupational diseases, as determined based on the number of claims made under our workers&#8217; compensation policy, excluding claims that were closed and for which no payment was made. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and its rules and regulations.

      "section": "1A",
      "text": " ITEM 1A. Ri sk Factors. \n\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results. We present these risk factors grouped by category, and the risks factors contained in each respective category are presented in order of their relative priority to us. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\nOUR INABILITY TO RETAIN OR HIRE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING BUSINESS AND GENERATE NEW BUSINESS. \n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. There is significant competition from within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for exceptional employees, especially in key positions. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nLosing employees who manage or support substantial customer relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete customer engagements, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Also, if any of our key employees were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. While our key employees are generally prohibited by contract from soliciting our employees and customers for a two-year period following separation from employment with us, they are not prohibited from competing with us. Similarly, if an employee joins us from a competitor and is subject to enforceable restrictive covenants, we may be delayed in optimizing the employee's potential. \n\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior leaders and key executives. The succession plans and employment arrangements we have in place with certain key executives do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. The loss of our senior leaders or other key employees, or our inability to continue to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOUR GROWTH STRATEGY DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE ACQUISITION OF OTHER INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE OR WHICH, IF CONSUMMATED, MAY NOT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO US. \n\nOur growth strategy partially includes the acquisition of other insurance intermediaries. Our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations, and expand into new markets requires us to implement and continuously improve our operations and our financial and management information systems. Integrated, acquired businesses may not achieve levels of revenues or profitability comparable to our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected. In addition, we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with firms and banks that may have substantially greater resources than we do. Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, such as diversion of management&#8217;s attention; difficulties in the integration of acquired operations and retention of employees; increase in expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; entry into unfamiliar markets or lines of business; unanticipated problems or legal liabilities; estimation of the acquisition earn-out payables; and tax and accounting issues, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Post-acquisition deterioration of operating performance could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges. \n\nA CYBERSECURITY ATTACK, OR ANY OTHER INTERRUPTION IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND/OR DATA SECURITY THAT MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS OR THE OPERATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES THAT SUPPORT US, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND REPUTATION. \n\nWe rely on information technology and third-party vendors to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, process claims, and timely and accurately report information to carriers and which often involves secure processing of confidential sensitive, proprietary and other types of information. Cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, &#8220;phishing&#8221; attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, any of which could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs. An interruption of our access to, or an inability to access, our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as malware infections, phishing campaigns and vulnerability exploit attempts, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. \n\nAdditionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets&#8217; information systems, which could \n\n&#160; \n\nexpose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. In the future, any material breaches of cybersecurity, or media reports of the same, even if untrue, could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, loss of proprietary data, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard customers&#8217; information or financial losses. Such losses may not be insured against or not fully covered through insurance we maintain. \n\nWe cannot entirely eliminate all risk of improper access to private information, and the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further system protections measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase. As these threats evolve, cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect, defend against and remediate. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation. \n\nWE HAVE OPERATIONS INTERNATIONALLY, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RISKS OR REQUIRE MORE MANAGEMENT TIME AND EXPENSE THAN OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS TO ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY. \n\nWe have substantial operations in the United Kingdom, as well as operations in Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Cayman Islands, Ireland, Italy and Northern Ireland. In the future, we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities. Our international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including: \n\n&#8226; Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; \n\n&#8226; Less flexible employee relationships, which may make it difficult and expensive to terminate employees and which limits our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment ceases; \n\n&#8226; Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war); \n\n&#8226; Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones; \n\n&#8226; Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws; \n\n&#8226; Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; \n\n&#8226; Adverse changes in tax rates; \n\n&#8226; Variations in foreign currency exchange rates; \n\n&#8226; Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices; \n\n&#8226; Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from us, including to or from our operations outside the United States; \n\n&#8226; Burdens of complying with, and the risk of employees or third parties acting on our behalf violating, anti-corruption laws in foreign countries; and \n\n&#8226; Burdens of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues. \n\nSIGNIFICANT INFLATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. \n\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including salary costs. Significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. Any significant increases in inflation, such as the wage inflation experienced during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nRAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TIME TO ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO DYNAMICS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. \n\nFrequent technological changes, new products and services and evolving industry standards are influencing the insurance business. The internet, for example, is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers and to facilitate business-to-business information exchange and transactions. \n\nWe are continuously taking steps to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities, including how we electronically interact with our customers and insurance carriers. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences, requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and data integrity, we could experience operational disruptions, regulatory or other legal problems, increases in operating expenses, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur technological development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in the accelerated recognition of expenses. If we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio regularly, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost-effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted. \n\nWE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMISSION REVENUES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE LOSS OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF CAPACITY TO WRITE BUSINESS, ADDITIONAL EXPENSE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE OR A MATERIAL DECREASE IN OUR COMMISSIONS. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, no more than 5.0% of our total core commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by one insurance company. Should any insurance company seek to terminate its arrangements with us or to otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten for us, we believe that other insurance companies are available to underwrite the business, although some additional expense and loss of market share could result. \n\nTHE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL DISASTERS COULD RESULT IN DECLINES IN PROFIT-SHARING CONTINGENT COMMISSIONS OR REDUCED INSURER CAPACITY, AND MAY ALSO SUBJECT OUR CAPITALIZED CAPTIVE INSURANCE FACILITIES TO CLAIMS EXPENSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nOur business is exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather or other climate events. The occurrence of any of these events may cause a decrease to our profit-sharing contingent commissions, which are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance companies based primarily upon the profitability placed with such companies generally during the prior year. The occurrence of natural disasters could also result in reduced underwriting capacity by insurance carriers, making it more difficult for us to place business. If access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of natural disasters, this may have a negative impact on our customers&#8217; access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business. Natural disasters may also subject our insurance company subsidiary operations, including the capitalized captive insurance facilities in which we participate, to claims expenses. \n\nBECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONCENTRATED IN FLORIDA, CALIFORNIA, MASSACHUSETTS, GEORGIA, NEW YORK, AND MICHIGAN, AS WELL AS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR REGULATORY CHANGES IN THESE JURISDICTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. \n\nA significant portion of our businesses are concentrated in Florida, California, Massachusetts, Georgia, Michigan, and New York, where for the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived approximately 19%, 9%, 9%, 7%, 6%, and 6% of our annual revenue, respectively. We believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other states. The insurance business in the U.S. is primarily a state-regulated industry, and therefore, state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry. \n\nWe also derived approximately 4.7% of our annual revenue from our businesses located in the United Kingdom. The insurance business in the United Kingdom is regulated at the national level by the Financial Conduct Authority, which may enact laws or otherwise act in ways that adversely affect the insurance industry or our ability to continue acquiring businesses in the United Kingdom. \n\nBecause our business is concentrated in the jurisdictions identified above, we face greater exposure to unfavorable changes in regulatory conditions in those jurisdictions than insurance intermediaries whose operations are more diversified through a greater number of states and/or countries. In addition, the occurrence of adverse economic conditions, natural or other disasters, or other circumstances specific to or otherwise significantly impacting these jurisdictions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (particularly in Florida, where we have 55 offices and our headquarters, as well as in Texas, where we have 21 offices), earthquakes (including in California, where we have 28 offices), power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fire, extreme weather conditions, geopolitical events such as terrorist acts and other natural or human-made disasters. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. \n\nOUR CORPORATE CULTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR SUCCESS, AND IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN THIS CULTURE, OR IF WE EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT, MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY, OR BUSINESS STRATEGY, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED. \n\nWe believe that a significant contributor to our success has been our corporate culture as a lean, highly competitive, decentralized growth and profit-oriented sales and service organization. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our profitability and/or our ability to retain and recruit people of the highest integrity and quality who are essential to our \n\n&#160; \n\nfuture success. We may face pressure to change our culture as we grow, particularly if we experience difficulties in attracting competent employees who are willing to embrace our culture. Remote and hybrid work arrangements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively impact our ability to maintain our culture. In addition, as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures, or if we experience a significant change in management, management philosophy or business strategy, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, such as our decentralized sales and service operating model, which could negatively impact our future success. \n\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITED UNDERWRITING RISK THROUGH OUR PARTICIPATION IN CAPITALIZED CAPTIVE INSURANCE FACILITIES, WHICH MAY SUBJECT US TO LIMITED CLAIMS EXPENSES \n\nFrom time to time, the Company participates in capitalized captive insurance facilities for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity for our customers and to participate in underwriting results. While the Company&#8217;s underwriting risk through its participation in these facilities is limited, we may be subject to claims expenses associated with catastrophic weather events, such as those in the third quarter of 2022 associated with Hurricane Ian. Our results of operations may be negatively impacted if any of the facilities incur claims expenses. \n\nOur F&#38;I businesses may be negatively impacted by a slowdown in vehicles sales in the united states or by regulatory changes, including tax-related changes, affecting the sale of f&#38;I products by vehicle dealers \n\nOur F&#38;I businesses earn commissions and fees from the sale of non-insurance warranty services and products by vehicle dealers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived less than 10% of our annual total revenues from our F&#38;I businesses. If there were a slowdown in vehicle sales in the United States or regulatory changes, including tax-related changes, affecting the sale of non-insurance warranty services and products by vehicle dealers, our F&#38;I businesses may be negatively impacted, which may impact our results of operation. \n\nWe face a variety of risks in our services segment, including our third-party claims administration operations, that are distinct from those we face in our insurance intermediary operations. \n\nOur Services segment, including our third-party claims administration operations, face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our insurance intermediary operations, including the risks that: \n\n&#8226; The favorable trend among both insurance companies and self-insured entities toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services may reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline; \n\n&#8226; Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain customers may result in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of lost business due to changes in management of such customers or for other reasons; \n\n&#8226; Contracting terms will become less favorable or the margins on our services may decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments; \n\n&#8226; Our revenue is impacted by claims volumes, which are dependent upon a number of factors and difficult to forecast accurately; \n\n&#8226; Economic weakness or a slowdown in economic activity could lead to a reduction in the number of claims we process; \n\n&#8226; The U.S. Federal government modifies, discontinues, or otherwise limits our ability to derive revenues from the Social Security disability benefits program, Medicare, or any other program or type of coverage from which our business derives revenue; \n\n&#8226; We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business and may be unable to obtain or retain certain customers if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and \n\n&#8226; Insurance companies or certain large self-insured entities may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our services. \n\nIf any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nDUE TO INHERENT LIMITATIONS, OUR SYSTEM OF DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING ALL ERRORS OR FRAUD, OR IN INFORMING MANAGEMENT OF ALL MATERIAL INFORMATION IN A TIMELY MANNER. \n\nOur management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of a control. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere can be no assurance that the design of any of our systems of controls will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. \n\nCERTAIN OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our executive officers, directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned approximately 16.5% of our outstanding common stock, of which J. Hyatt Brown, our chairman of the board, and his sons, J. Powell Brown, our president and chief executive officer, and P. Barrett Brown, our executive vice president and the president of our Retail segment, beneficially owned approximately 15.8%. As a result, our executive officers, directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over (i) the election of our board of directors, (ii) the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and (iii) our affairs and policies. \n\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters \n\nCHANGES IN DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. \n\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, retention, handling, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. These laws apply to transfers of information among our affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors. For example, the European Union adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) in May 2016, which replaced the former EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR became fully effective in May 2018 and requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its processing, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to revise certain of our business practices. Additionally, a judgement by the Court of Justice of the European Union on Schrems II has made cross border data transfers to organizations outside of the European Economic Area more onerous and uncertain. In addition, legislators and regulators in the U.S. have enacted and are proposing new and more robust privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations in light of the recent broad-based cyber-attacks at a number of companies, including but not limited to the New York State Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Some states provide right of action for data breaches or for collection of certain categories of personal information without consent, which may result in increased litigation. \n\nThese and similar initiatives around the world could increase the cost of developing, implementing or securing our servers and require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, adding to our technology and compliance costs. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. \n\nIMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. \n\nWe are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of our customers&#8217; confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees. We have put in place administrative, physical, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information; however, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be improperly disclosed or accessed. Disclosure of this information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. \n\nTHE RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH NON-U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. \n\nIn 2022, the Company acquired GRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited and its business and the general insurance operating companies of BdB Limited companies (the &#8220;Acquisitions&#8221;). The Acquisitions introduce us to several new geographic markets, subjecting us to additional non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies which did not previously apply to us. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have become more stringent over time, could increase our cost of doing business, and could result in conflicting legal requirements. These laws and regulations include international labor and employment laws and data privacy requirements. We will be subject to the risk that we, our employees and our agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations or policies, for which we might be held responsible. Actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives. \n\n&#160; \n\nOUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CERTAIN ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS, REGULATORY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS. \n\nWe are subject to various actual and potential claims, regulatory actions and other proceedings, including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance and/or the provision of services in the ordinary course of business, of which we cannot, and likely will not be able to, predict the outcome with certainty. Because we often assist customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert, errors and omissions claims against us may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Also, the failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Claimants may seek large damage awards, and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs, including punitive damages. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based upon allegations that our employees or sub-agents failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of customers, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our customers on a fiduciary basis. In addition, given the long-tail nature of professional liability claims, errors and omissions matters can relate to matters dating back many years. \n\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience. In addition, regardless of monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and cause harm to our carrier, customer or employee relationships, or divert employees and management resources. \n\nOUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH INSURANCE CARRIERS ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY DUE TO POTENTIAL CHANGES IN REGULATIONS. \n\nThe business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry, including our practices and arrangements, are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities. Certain of our offices are parties to profit-sharing contingent commission agreements with certain insurance companies, including agreements providing for potential payment of revenue-sharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies and/or additional factors such as retention ratios and the overall volume of business that an office or offices place with those insurance companies. Additionally, some of our offices are parties to supplemental commission agreements with certain insurance companies, which provide for commission rates in excess of standard commission rates to be applied to specific lines of business, such as group health business, and which are based primarily on the overall volume of business that such office or offices placed with those insurance companies. Various state legislatures may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements, including laws prohibiting such arrangements, and addressing disclosure of such arrangements to insureds. Various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters which could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWE COMPETE IN A HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INCREASED EXPENSES OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS. \n\nWe conduct business in each of the 50 states of the United States of America and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of those states. The primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders, and it is difficult to anticipate how changes in such regulation would be implemented and enforced. As a result, such regulation and supervision could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs, technology compliance, restricting the products or services we may sell, the markets we may enter, the methods by which we may sell our products and services, or the prices we may charge for our services and the form of compensation we may accept from our customers, carriers and third parties. The laws of the various state jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing of entities to transact business, licensing of agents, admittance of assets, regulating premium rates, approving policy forms, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, determining technology and data protection requirements, establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards, requiring participation in guarantee funds and shared market mechanisms, and restricting payment of dividends. Also, in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance, states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools, which compete directly, on a subsidized basis, with private insurance providers. We act as agents and brokers for such state insurance funds and assigned risk pools in California and New York as well as certain other states. These state funds and pools could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive. Any such reductions, in a state in which we have substantial operations could affect the profitability of our operations in such state or cause us to change our marketing focus. Further, state insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, and such reexamination may result in the enactment of insurance-related laws and regulations, or the issuance of interpretations thereof that adversely affect our business. Certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years, which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations. Other legislative developments that could adversely affect us include: changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the Affordable Care Act); and federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property \n\n&#160; \n\ninsurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage that compete with or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers. Also, as climate change issues become more prevalent, the U.S. and other governments are beginning to respond to these issues. This increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations, new or enhanced reporting, diligence or disclosure rules that may negatively affect us and our customers and could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nINCREASING SCRUTINY AND CHANGING EXPECTATIONS FROM INVESTORS AND CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) PRACTICES MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON US OR EXPOSE US TO REPUTATIONAL OR OTHER RISKS. \n\nThere is increased focus, including from governmental organizations, investors and customers, on ESG issues such as environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity and inclusion, racial justice and workplace conduct. Negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social media and other forums could damage our reputation if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address any one or more of these issues. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and others to do business with us. \n\nSome investors have increased their emphasis on the ESG practices of companies across all industries, including with respect to climate and human capital management. Certain investors have developed their own ESG ratings while others use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company&#8217;s ESG practices and make investment decisions or otherwise engage with the company to influence its practices in these areas. Additionally, our customers may evaluate our ESG practices and/or request that we adopt certain ESG policies in order to work with us. Also, organizations that provide ratings information to certain investors on ESG matters may assign unfavorable ratings to the Company, which may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment capital to other companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our costs of capital. \n\nNew government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and new mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure. Our failure to meet expectations, whether the expectations are set by us or by investors or other stakeholders, or to any other failure to make progress in this area on a timely basis, or at all, may negatively impact our reputation and our business. \n\nPROPOSED TORT REFORM LEGISLATION, IF ENACTED, COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR LIABILITY INSURANCE, THEREBY REDUCING OUR COMMISSION REVENUES. \n\nLegislation concerning tort reform has been considered, from time to time, in the United States Congress and in several state legislatures. Among the provisions considered in such legislation have been limitations on damage awards, including punitive damages, and various restrictions applicable to class action lawsuits. Enactment of these or similar provisions by Congress, or by states in which we sell insurance, could reduce the demand for liability insurance policies or lead to a decrease in policy limits of such policies sold, thereby reducing our commission revenues. \n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing \n\nIF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN CERTAIN OF OUR AGREEMENTS, OUR LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants and other limitations contained in each of the credit agreements that govern out debt. However, failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements or other credit or similar agreements to which we may become a party could result in a default, rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. In the event of certain defaults, the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to or purchase any additional notes from us and could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable. If the indebtedness under these agreements or our other indebtedness, were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. \n\nCERTAIN OF OUR AGREEMENTS CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS THAT LIMIT THE DISCRETION OF OUR MANAGEMENT IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND COULD PREVENT US FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL ACTIVITIES. \n\nThe restrictive covenants in our debt agreements may impact how we operate our business and prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities. In particular, among other covenants, our debt agreements require us to maintain a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted for certain transaction-related items (&#8220;Consolidated EBITDA&#8221;), to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated net indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur compliance with these covenants could limit management&#8217;s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities. \n\nOUR BUSINESS, AND THEREFORE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FURTHER CHANGES IN THE U.S. CREDIT MARKETS. \n\nThe failure of any lender under our revolving credit facility (which matures in 2026) (the &#34;Revolving Credit Facility&#34;) could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility, which over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures. Tightening conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancing. \n\nWe also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurance companies were to experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND TO THE EXTENT WE USE DEBT TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND NET INVESTMENT INCOME. \n\nAs of July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) benchmark rate for floating rate debt, and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021. To help with the transition, the Federal Reserve Board and New York Fed have commissioned the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;), composed of a diverse set of private-sector entities that have an important presence in markets affected by USD LIBOR and a wide array of official-sector entities, including banking and financial sector regulators, as ex-officio members. The ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as the best alternative rate to LIBOR post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR from LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s primary exposures are debt instruments referencing LIBOR-based rates, which include the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement&#8221;) term loan balance of $234.4 million outstanding and matures in October 2026, as well as the term loan credit agreement (the &#8220;Term Loan Credit Agreement&#8221;) which had an outstanding balance of $210.0 million and matures in December 2023. As such, any potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital, interest rate exposure and net investment income cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in October 2021, which includes provisions regarding the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. The new benchmark for our USD borrowings will be SOFR, in which the Company is taking active measures to transition and replace LIBOR. The shift to SOFR from LIBOR is complex and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. \n\nRisks Related to Our Industry \n\nCHANGES IN CURRENT U.S. OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING AN EXTENDED SLOWDOWN IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. \n\nIf economic conditions were to worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including declines in insurable exposure units, declines in insurance premium rates, the financial insolvency of insurance companies, or the reduced ability of customers to pay. Also, if general economic conditions are poor, some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If these customers are affected by poor economic conditions, but yet remain in existence, they may face liquidity problems or other financial difficulties that could result in delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Any of these effects could decrease our net revenues and profitability. \n\nOUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE MAY DECREASE AS A RESULT OF DISINTERMEDIATION WITHIN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES, TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, AS WELL AS THE SHIFT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL INSURANCE MARKETS. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe insurance intermediary business is highly competitive and we actively compete with numerous firms for customers and insurance companies, many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over us. Other competitive concerns may include the quality of our products and services, our pricing and the ability of some of our customers to self-insure and the entrance of technology companies into the insurance intermediary business. A number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance, primarily to individuals, and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers. In addition, and to the extent that banks, securities firms, private equity funds and insurance companies affiliate, the financial services industry may experience further consolidation, and we therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry, as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly, and aggressively, offer a wider variety of financial services, including insurance intermediary services. \n\nIn addition, there has been an increase in alternative insurance markets, such as self-insurance, captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets, and we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets. \n\nOUR BUSINESS, AND THEREFORE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS THAT RESULT IN REDUCED INSURER CAPACITY. \n\nOur results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage, which depends in turn on those insurance companies&#8217; ability to procure reinsurance. Capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers. We have no control over these matters. To the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, we may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that our customers desire and the coverage we are able to procure for our customers may be more expensive or limited. \n\nQUARTERLY AND ANNUAL VARIATIONS IN OUR COMMISSIONS THAT RESULT FROM THE TIMING OF POLICY RENEWALS AND THE NET EFFECT OF NEW AND LOST BUSINESS PRODUCTION MAY HAVE UNEXPECTED EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. \n\nOur commission income (including profit-sharing contingent commissions and supplemental commissions) can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production. We do not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, customers&#8217; demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business (which includes policies that are not renewed), and cancellations. In addition, we rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions. Because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies, we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after the end of that period, which can adversely affect our ability to forecast these revenues and therefore budget for significant future expenditures. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business, policy renewals and payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOver the last three years our profit-sharing contingent commissions generally have been in the range of 3.0% to 3.5% of our previous year&#8217;s total core commissions and fees. Due to, among other things, potentially poor macroeconomic conditions, the inherent uncertainty of loss in our industry and changes in underwriting criteria due in part to the high loss ratios experienced by insurance companies, we estimate the amount of profit-sharing contingent commissions we have earned for policies we have bound and are effective. Further, we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves, which affects our ability to make profit-sharing calculations. \n\nSupplemental commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the volume of business that we place with them and are generally paid over the course of the year. Any decrease in their payment to us could adversely affect our results of operations, profitability and our financial condition. \n\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO INTANGIBLE ASSET RISK; SPECIFICALLY, OUR GOODWILL MAY BECOME IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE. \n\nAs of the date of the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2022 fiscal year, we have $6.7 billion of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of November 30, 2022 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of each reporting unit. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an additional impairment analysis before the next annual goodwill impairment test. If determined that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, the appropriate adjustment would be recorded which could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position. \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 1-&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; and Note 4-&#8220;Goodwill&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.&#8221; \n\nAdditionally, the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the Company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Accordingly, if there are any such circumstances that occur during the year, we assess the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group. Any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted. \n\nThere have been no impairments recorded to either goodwill or amortizable intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nTHE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS WELL AS FUTURE PANDEMICS, EPIDEMICS OR OUTBREAKS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, AND THE RESULTING GOVERNMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY&#8217;S BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, CUSTOMERS, INSURANCE CARRIERS AND THIRD PARTIES. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which could further adversely affect our business and may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In addition, if COVID-19 creates disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets in the future, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n\nWe cannot predict the impact that COVID-19, or future pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease, will have in the future on our customers, insurance carriers, suppliers and other third-party contractors, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. Even after a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of these events. Further, these events may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks to our operations. \n\nThese and other disruptions related to pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the potential effects pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease also could impact and, in some cases, magnify many of our risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, any potential effects of pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease may lag behind the developments related to such events. \n\n"

Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stoc kholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. \n\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;BRO&#8221;. \n\nOn February 23, 2023, there were 284,294,500 shares of our common stock outstanding, held by approximately 1,804 shareholders of record. \n\nSales of Unregistered Securities \n\nDuring 2022, the Company issued 252,802 shares of the Company's common stock to the owners of the businesses acquired in connection with the acquisition of GRP. The issuances were made in reliance upon the following exemptions or exclusions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;): Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. \n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities \n\nUnder the authorizations from the Company&#8217;s board of directors, shares may be purchased from time to time, at the Company&#8217;s discretion and subject to the availability of stock, market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, the Company&#8217;s financial performance and other potential factors. These purchases may be carried out through open market purchases, block trades, accelerated share repurchase plans of up to $100.0 million each (unless otherwise approved by the board of directors), negotiated private transactions or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. On July 18, 2014, the Company&#8217;s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of its shares of common stock, and on July 20, 2015, the Company&#8217;s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $400.0 million of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. On May 1, 2019, the board of directors approved an additional repurchase authorization amount of $372.5 million to bring the total available share repurchase authorization at that time to approximately $500.0 million. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company repurchased 1,164,009 shares at an average price of $63.62 for a total cost of $74.1 million under the current share repurchase authorization. At December 31, 2022, the remaining amount authorized by our board of directors for share repurchases was $249.6 million. Under the authorized repurchase programs, the Company has repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $748.0 million between 2014 and 2022. \n\nThe following table presents information with respect to our purchases of our common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Period \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal number of shares purchased (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAverage price paid per share \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nApproximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs \n\n&#160; \n\nOctober 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n62.89 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n249.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nNovember 1, 2022 to November 30, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n56.31 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n249.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n249.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n56.45 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n249.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) Of the shares reported in this column, no shares were purchased in open market transactions and all shares reported in this column are attributable to shares withheld for taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted shares awarded under our Performance Stock Plan and 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. \n\n&#160; \n\nPerformance Graph \n\nThe following graph is a comparison of five-year cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock as compared with the cumulative total shareholder return for the S&#38;P 500 Composite Index, the NYSE Composite Index, and a group of peer insurance broker and agency companies (Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher &#38; Co, Marsh &#38; McLennan Companies, and Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company). In previous years, we compared our cumulative total shareholder return with the NYSE Composite Index. We have replaced the NYSE Composite Index with the S&#38;P 500 Composite Index as required by SEC rules. In this transition year, the stock performance graph below includes the comparative performance of the new index and the previously reported index. The returns of each company have been weighted according to such companies&#8217; respective stock market capitalizations as of December 31, 2017 for the purposes of arriving at a peer group average. The total return calculations are based upon an assumed $100.00 investment on December 31, 2017, with all dividends reinvested. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/17 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/18 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/19 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/20 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/21 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12/22 \n\n&#160; \n\nBrown &#38; Brown, Inc. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n108.29 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n156.66 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n189.64 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n283.14 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n231.09 \n\n&#160; \n\nS&#38;P 500 Composite \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n95.61 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n125.70 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n148.81 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n191.48 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n156.77 \n\n&#160; \n\nNYSE Composite \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n91.21 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n114.70 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n122.83 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n148.42 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n134.76 \n\n&#160; \n\nPeer Group \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n100.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n106.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n149.32 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n164.77 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n233.57 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n238.65 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nGeneral \n\nCompany Overview \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to those Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, please see &#8220;Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; below regarding important information on non-GAAP financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis. \n\nWe are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services organization headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. As an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. Commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds&#8217; underlying &#8220;insurable exposure units,&#8221; which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, sales or payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. We also participate in capitalized captive insurance facilities (the &#34;Captives&#34;) for the purpose of having additional capacity to place coverage, drive additional revenues and to participate in underwriting. The Company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. These Captives give us another way to deliver incremental revenue growth and continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain managing general agents. The Captives limit the Company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by only participating in certain tranches of the underwriting. \n\nWe have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2022, with the exception of 2009, when our revenues declined 1.0%. Our revenues grew from $95.6 million in 1993 to $3.6 billion in 2022, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 13.3%. In the same 29-year period, we increased net income from $8.1 million to $671.8 million in 2022, a 16.5% compound annual growth rate. \n\nThe volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, changes in general economic and competitive conditions, a health pandemic or a reduction of purchased limits the occurrence of catastrophic weather events all affect our revenues. For example, higher levels of inflation, an increase the value of insurable exposure units, or a general decline in economic activity, could decrease the value of insurable exposure units. Conversely, increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. Historically, we have grown our revenues as a result of our focus on net new business and acquisitions. We foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture, which enables responsiveness to changing business conditions and drives accountability for results. \n\nThe term &#8220;core commissions and fees&#8221; excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions, and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. The net change in core commissions and fees reflects the aggregate changes attributable to: (i) net new and lost accounts; (ii) net changes in our customers&#8217; exposure units; (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners; (iv) the net change in fees paid to us by our customers; and (v) any businesses acquired or disposed of. \n\nWe also earn profit-sharing contingent commissions, which are commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but in select situations may reflect additional considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. These commissions, which are included in our commissions and fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income, are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written and are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each subsequent year, based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s). Over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 3.0% of commissions and fees revenue. \n\nFee revenues primarily relate to services other than securing coverage for our customers, and to a lesser extent as fees negotiated in lieu of commissions. Fee revenues are generated by: (i) our Services segment, which is primarily a fee-based business that provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services; (ii) our National Programs and Wholesale Brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies; and (iii) our Retail segment in our large-account customer base, where we primarily earn fees for securing insurance for our customers, and in our automobile dealer services (&#8220;F&#38;I&#8221;) businesses where we earn fees for \n\n&#160; \n\nassisting our customers with creating and selling warranty and service risk management programs. Fee revenues as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, represented 25.8% in 2022 and 27.4% in 2021. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our commissions and fees growth rate was 16.9% and our consolidated Organic Revenue growth rate was 8.1%. \n\nHistorically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash and where permitted, on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. Our policy as it relates to the Company&#8217;s capital is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term money-market funds and fixed income investment securities. Investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. Other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other revenues. \n\nIncome before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $113.3 million, or 14.9% over 2021, driven by new business and growth from existing customers, acquisitions we completed in the last twelve months and the year-over-year change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, which were partially offset by incremental operating costs, increased amortization expense as a result of our recent acquisitions along with increased interest expense associated with higher average debt balances from debt issued and bank financing in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the acquisitions of GRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited and its businesses (&#34;GRP&#34;), Orchid Underwriters Agency and CrossCover Insurance Services (&#34;Orchid&#34;) and BdB Limited companies (&#34;BdB&#34;) as well as increases in the floating-rate benchmark used on our adjustable rate debt and the net change in any gain or loss associated with the sales of businesses or books of business. \n\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nIn the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;), we provide references to the following non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the SEC rules: Total Revenues - Adjusted, Organic Revenue, EBITDAC, EBITDAC Margin, EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted. We present these measures because we believe such information is of interest to the investment community and because we believe it provides additional meaningful methods to evaluate the Company&#8217;s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis due to the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability and that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance. This non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company&#8217;s consolidated income statements as of the relevant date. Consistent with Regulation G, a description of such information is provided below and tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP information are contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under &#8220;Results of Operations - Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nWe view Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our four segments, because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year. We also view Total Revenues - Adjusted, EBITDAC, EBITDAC - Adjusted, EBITDAC Margin and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance, as they present more comparable measurements of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner. As disclosed in our most recent proxy statement, we use Organic Revenue and EBITDAC Margin as key performance metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans for executive officers and other key employees. \n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, we include guaranteed supplemental commissions (&#34;GSCs&#34;) as part of core commissions and fees and, therefore, GSCs are a component of Organic Revenue. All current and prior periods contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted for this treatment. GSCs are a stable source of revenue that are highly correlated to core commissions, so isolating them separately provided no meaningful incremental value in evaluating our revenue. \n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the following, in addition to the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, are excluded from certain non-GAAP measures, as we believe these amounts are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the business and are not easily comparable from period-to-period: \n\n&#8226; &#8220;(Gain)/loss on disposal,&#8221; a caption on our consolidated statements of income which reflects net proceeds received as compared to net book value related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure. \n\n&#8226; &#8220;Acquisition/Integration Costs,&#8221; which represent the acquisition and integration costs (e.g., costs associated with regulatory filings, legal/accounting services, due diligence and the costs of integrating our information technology systems) arising out of our acquisitions of GRP, Orchid and BdB, which are not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future. \n\n&#8226; The period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation (&#8220;Foreign Currency Translation&#8221;) , which is calculated by applying current-year foreign exchange rates to the various functional currencies in our business to our reporting currency of U.S. dollars for the same period in the prior year. \n\nWe are presenting EBITDAC - Adjusted and EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for the current and prior year periods contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K so these non-GAAP financial measures compare both periods on the same basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-GAAP Revenue Measures \n\n&#8226; Total Revenues - Adjusted is our total revenues, excluding the period-over-period impact of Foreign Currency Translation. \n\n&#8226; Organic Revenue is our core commissions and fees less: (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly acquired operations; (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period); and (iii) the period-over-period impact of Foreign Currency Translation. The term &#8220;core commissions and fees&#8221; excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold and specific fee-based services rendered. Organic Revenue can be expressed as a dollar amount or a percentage rate when describing Organic Revenue growth. \n\nNon-GAAP Earnings Measures \n\n&#8226; EBITDAC is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. \n\n&#8226; EBITDAC Margin is defined as EBITDAC divided by total revenues. \n\n&#8226; EBITDAC - Adjusted is defined as EBITDAC, excluding (i) (gain)/loss on disposal, (ii) Acquisition/Integration Costs and (iii) the period-over-period impact of Foreign Currency Translation. \n\n&#8226; EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted is defined as EBITDAC - Adjusted divided by Total Revenues - Adjusted. \n\nOur industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments and, therefore, comparability may be limited. This supplemental non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nAcquisitions \n\nPart of our business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries and service organizations to join our operations. From 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired 610 insurance intermediary operations. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, which are based upon a combination of historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for our judgments about the recognition of revenues, expenses, carrying values of our assets and liabilities, of which values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation and reserves for litigation. In particular, the accounting for these areas is subject to uncertainty because it requires significant use of judgment to be made by management. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe majority of our revenue is commissions derived from our performance as agents and brokers, acting on behalf of insurance carriers to sell products to customers that are seeking to transfer risk, and conversely, acting on behalf of those customers in negotiating with insurance carriers seeking to acquire risk in exchange for premiums. In the majority of these arrangements, our performance obligation is complete upon the effective date of the bound policy, as such, that is when the associated revenue is recognized. In some arrangements, where we are compensated through commissions, we also perform other services for our customer beyond binding of coverage. In those arrangements we apportion the commission between binding of coverage and other services based on their relative fair value and recognize the associated revenue as those performance obligations are satisfied. Where the Company&#8217;s performance obligations have been completed, but the final amount of compensation is unknown due to variable factors, we estimate the amount of such compensation. We refine those estimates upon our receipt of additional information or final settlement, whichever occurs first. \n\nTo a lesser extent, the Company earns revenues in the form of fees. Like commissions, fees paid to us in lieu of commission, are recognized upon the effective date of the bound policy. When we are paid a fee for service, however, the associated revenue is recognized over a period of time that coincides with when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of our work, which characterizes \n\n&#160; \n\nmost of our claims processing arrangements and various services performed in our property and casualty, and employee benefits practices. Other fees are typically recognized upon the completion of the delivery of the agreed-upon services to the customer. \n\nTo a much lesser extent, the Company earned revenues starting in 2022 in the form of net retained earned premiums in connection with the Captives. These premiums are reported net of the ceded premiums for reinsurance and recognized evenly over the associated policy periods. \n\nManagement determines a policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances. \n\nPlease see Note 2 &#8220;Revenues&#8221; in the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information regarding the nature and timing of our revenues. \n\nBusiness Combinations and Purchase Price Allocations \n\nWe have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses. These assets generally consist of purchased customer accounts, non-compete agreements, and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). The determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges. \n\nIn connection with acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements. Purchased customer accounts include the right to represent insureds or claimants supported by the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies, customers and other matters essential to policy renewals of delivery of services. Their value primarily represents the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future duration of the acquired customer relationships. The valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency, expenses and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts. Non-compete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements. Purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which typically range from 3 to 15 years. The excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized. \n\nThe recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions, where an earn-out is part of the negotiated transaction. Subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a result of updated expectations for the performance of the associated business. \n\nThe fair value of earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, the acquired business&#8217;s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business, and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. The expected future payments are estimated based on the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. These estimates are then discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecast earn-out payments will be made. \n\nIntangible Assets Impairment \n\nGoodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, measured by a fair-value-based test. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. To determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is not determined that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying amount, the Company will calculate the fair value of the reporting unit for comparison against the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based upon multiples of EBITDAC, or on a discounted cash flow basis. \n\nManagement assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Any of the following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) a significant negative industry or economic trend, and (iii) a significant decline in our market capitalization. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-referenced factors, an impairment analysis is performed. Management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to revise the assessment and, if appropriate, record an impairment charge. We completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of November 30, 2022 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets. Additionally, there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-Cash Stock-Based Compensation \n\nWe grant non-vested stock awards to our employees, with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards, subject to any performance modification. During the performance measurement period, we review the probable outcome of the performance conditions associated with our performance awards and adjust the expense recognition accruals with the expected performance outcome. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the performance conditions for approximately 1.2 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock granted under the Company&#8217;s 2010 SIP and approximately 22,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock granted under the Company&#8217;s 2019 SIP were determined by the Compensation Committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2018 and 2020. These grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on December 31, 2020. The vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2018 grant date and four years from the 2020 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. As a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. The awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the performance conditions for approximately 1.3 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock granted under the Company&#8217;s 2010 SIP and approximately 22,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock granted under the Company&#8217;s 2019 SIP were determined by the Compensation Committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2019 and 2021. These grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on December 31, 2021. The vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2019 grant date and four years from the 2021 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. As a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. The awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the performance conditions for approximately 970,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock granted under the under the Company&#8217;s 2019 SIP were determined by the Compensation Committee to have been satisfied relative to the performance-based grants issued in 2020 and 2022. These grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on December 31, 2022. The vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to five years from the 2020 grant date and four years from the 2022 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable. As a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges. The awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share. \n\nLitigation and Claims \n\nWe are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. If it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable, an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income as incurred. Management, with the assistance of in-house and outside counsel, determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues. New developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income. \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 \n\nThe following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.

Core commissions and fees in 2022 increased $509.2 million, composed of (i) $239.9 million of net new and renewal business, which reflects an Organic Revenue growth rate of 8.1%; (ii) $288.6 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2021; (iii) an offsetting decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation of $4.5 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $14.8 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2022 increased by $6.5 million, or 7.9%, compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was the result of recent acquisitions and qualifying for certain profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2022 that we did not qualify for in the prior year, partially offset by reduced profit-sharing contingent commissions relating to the impacts from the estimated insured property losses associated with Hurricane Ian. \n\nInvestment Income \n\nInvestment income for 2022 was $6.5 million, compared with $1.1 million in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher average interest rates compared to 2021. \n\nOther Income, Net \n\nOther income for 2022 was $3.7 million, compared with $2.8 million in 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 50.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased 11.0%, or $180.0 million. This increase included $128.6 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2021. Therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2022 and 2021 increased by $51.4 million or 3.2%. This underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to: (i) increased claims associated with our self-insured employee health plan; (ii) an increase in salaries attributable to inflation; (iii) an increase in producer compensation associated with revenue growth; partially offset by (iv) the year-over-year decrease of approximately $36.6 million in the value of deferred compensation liabilities driven by changes in the market prices of our employees' investment elections associated with our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within other operating expenses as we hold assets to fund these liabilities that closely match the investment elections of our employees. \n\nOther Operating Expenses \n\nOther operating expenses represented 16.7% of total revenues for 2022 as compared to 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating expenses for 2022 increased $193.8 million, or 48.1%, from the same period of 2021. The net increase included: (i) $73.7 million of other operating expenses related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2021; (ii) increased variable costs with travel and entertainment being the largest driver; (iii) acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisitions of Orchid, GRP, and BdB, and; (iv) the year-over-year increase of approximately $36.6 million in the value of assets held to fund the associated liabilities within our deferred compensation plan, which was substantially offset within employee compensation and benefits as noted above. \n\nGain or Loss on Disposal \n\nThe Company recognized net gains on disposals of $4.5 million in 2022 and $9.6 million in 2021. The gains on disposal were due to activity associated with sales of businesses or book of business. Although we do not routinely sell businesses or customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth, or because doing so is in the Company&#8217;s best interest. \n\nAmortization \n\nAmortization expense for 2022 increased $27.0 million to $146.6 million, or 22.6% over 2021. This increase reflects the amortization of new intangibles from businesses acquired within the past twelve months, partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. \n\nDepreciation \n\nDepreciation expense for 2022 increased $5.9 million to $39.2 million, or 17.7% over 2021. Changes in depreciation expense reflect the addition of fixed assets resulting from business initiatives, net additions of fixed assets resulting from businesses acquired in the past twelve months, partially offset by fixed assets which became fully depreciated. \n\nInterest Expense \n\nInterest expense for 2022 increased $76.2 million to $141.2 million, or 117.2%, from 2021. The increase is due to higher average debt balances resulting from debt issuance and bank financing in the first quarter of 2022 to fund the acquisitions of Orchid, GRP, and BdB, as well as increases in the floating rate benchmark used on our adjustable-rate debt. \n\nChange in Estimated Acquisition Earn-Out Payables \n\nAccounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 805-Business Combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100% of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. Additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. The recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income when incurred or reasonably estimated. Estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe net charge or credit to the Consolidated Statements of Income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables balance, and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were reevaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in ASC 820-Fair Value Measurement. The resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in fair value of estimated acquisition earn-out payables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(45.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense accretion \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet change in earnings from estimated acquisition earn-out payables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(38.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n40.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was reevaluated and decreased by $45.9 million for 2022 and increased by $34.2 million for 2021, which are credits and charges respectively, exclusive of interest expense accretion, to the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2022 and 2021. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $251.6 million, of which $119.3 million was recorded as accounts payable and $132.3 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $291.0 million, of which $78.4 million was recorded as accounts payable and $212.6 million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe effective tax rate on income from operations was 23.3% in 2022 and 23.0% in 2021. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nAs discussed in Note 16 &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we operate four reportable segments: Retail, National Programs, Wholesale Brokerage and Services. On a segmented basis, changes in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from activity associated with acquisitions. Likewise, other revenues in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income. As such, in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment, management focuses on the Organic Revenue growth rate and EBITDAC margin. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe reconciliation of total commissions and fees included in the Consolidated Statements of Income to Organic Revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, including by segment, and the growth rates for Organic Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 are as follows: \n\n&#160;

The $305.1 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) $111.6 million related to net new and renewal business; (ii) approximately $205.1 million related to the core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2021; (iii) an offsetting decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation of $3.9 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $7.2 million related to commissions and fees recorded in 2021 from businesses since divested. Profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2022 increased 25.4%, or $9.9 million, over 2021, to $48.8. The Retail segment&#8217;s growth rate for total commissions and fees was 17.8% and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 6.5% for 2022. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by net new business written during the preceding twelve months and growth on renewals of existing customers. Renewal business was impacted by rate increases in most lines of business with continued increases in employee benefits, commercial and condominium property, partially offset by continued premium rate reductions in workers&#8217; compensation. \n\nIncome before income taxes for 2022 increased 39.6%, or $132.3 million, over the same period in 2021, to $466.7 million. The primary factors driving this increase were: (i) the profit associated with the net increase in revenue as described above; (ii) the drivers of EBITDAC described below; (iii) amortization and depreciation growing faster than total revenues; and (iv) a decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2022 increased 17.1%, or $93.9 million, from the same period in 2022, to $643.4 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for 2022 decreased to 30.9% from 31.2% in the same period in 2021. EBITDAC Margin was impacted by increased variable operating expenses, which are largely travel and meeting related. \n\nNational Programs Segment \n\nThe National Programs segment manages over 40 programs supported by approximately 100 well-capitalized carrier partners. In most cases, the insurance carriers that support these programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs operations. These programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and Brown &#38; Brown retail \n\n&#160; \n\nagents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. This segment also operates our write-your-own flood insurance carrier, WNFIC and participates in two Captives. WNFIC&#8217;s underwriting business consists of policies written under and fully ceded to the NFIP and excess flood and private flood policies which are fully reinsured in the private market. The Captives provide additional underwriting capacity and allow us to participate in underwriting results. The Company has traditionally participated in underwriting profits through profit-sharing contingent commissions. These Captives give us another way to continue to participate in underwriting results while limiting exposure to claims expenses. The Captives focus on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties underwritten by certain managing general agents. The Captives limit the Company's exposure to claims expenses either through reinsurance or by participating in limited tranches of the underwriting risk. \n\nThe National Programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: Professional Programs, Personal Lines Programs, Commercial Programs, Public Entity-Related Programs and Specialty Programs. Approximately 76.1% of the National Programs segment&#8217;s commissions and fees revenue is commission based. \n\nFinancial information relating to our National Programs segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nREVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCore commissions and fees \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n830.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n665.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nProfit-sharing contingent commissions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(21.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n35.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n116.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(50.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n859.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n22.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n701.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nEXPENSES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n318.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n294.7 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n196.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n128.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n(Gain)/loss on disposal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(117.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4.5 \n\n) \n\nAmortization \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n35.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n29.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n56.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n33.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n189.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in estimated acquisition earn-out payables \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(10.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n41.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(7.7 \n\n) \n\nTotal expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n588.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n28.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n459.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n271.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.9 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n242.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n31.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n34.5 \n\n% \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n345.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n278.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nEBITDAC Margin - Adjusted (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n40.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n39.7 \n\n% \n\nOrganic Revenue growth rate (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.8 \n\n% \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits relative to total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n37.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n42.0 \n\n% \n\nOther operating expenses relative to total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n22.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n18.3 \n\n% \n\nCapital expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n49.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal assets at December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,467.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n51.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,943.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) &#8220;Income Before Income Taxes Margin&#8221; is defined as income before income taxes divided by total revenues \n\n(2) A non-GAAP financial measure \n\nNMF = Not a meaningful figure \n\nThe National Programs segment&#8217;s total revenue for 2022 increased 22.5%, or $157.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2021, to $859.5 million. The $164.7 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i) approximately $103.7 million of net new and renewal business; (ii) $64.9 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2021; (iii) an offsetting decrease from the impact of foreign currency translation of $0.6 million; and (iv) an offsetting decrease of $3.3 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions in 2022 decreased 21.8%, or $7.7 million, from 2021, to $27.6 primarily relating to the impacts from the estimated insured property losses associated with Hurricane Ian. The National Programs segment&#8217;s growth rate for total commissions and fees was 22.4% and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 15.7% for 2022. The Organic Revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in lender placed coverage, good new business and retention, exposure unit expansion and rate increases for many programs. \n\nIncome before income taxes for 2022 increased 11.9%, or $28.8 million, from the same period in 2021, to $271.1 million. Income before income taxes increased due to the drivers of EBITDAC described below. This was partially offset by an increase in intercompany interest expense and increased amortization expense associated with recent acquisitions. \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2022 increased 24.0%, or $66.9 million, from the same period in 2021, to $345.2 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for 2022 increased to 40.2% from 39.7% in the prior year due to strong total revenue growth along with leverage our expense base. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWholesale Brokerage Segment \n\nThe Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, including Brown &#38; Brown retail agents. Approximately 84.9% of the Wholesale Brokerage segment&#8217;s commissions and fees revenue is commission based. \n\nFinancial information relating to our Wholesale Brokerage segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nREVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCore commissions and fees \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n440.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n394.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nProfit-sharing contingent commissions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n53.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n50.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(50.0 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n453.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n403.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nEXPENSES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n239.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n212.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n70.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n60.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n(Gain)/loss on disposal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmortization \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(19.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in estimated acquisition earn-out payables \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(123.3 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n335.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n308.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n117.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n94.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n26.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n23.5 \n\n% \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n145.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n129.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nEBITDAC Margin - Adjusted (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n32.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n32.2 \n\n% \n\nOrganic Revenue growth rate (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7.6 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7.9 \n\n% \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits relative to total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52.8 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52.7 \n\n% \n\nOther operating expenses relative to total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.0 \n\n% \n\nCapital expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n75.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal assets at December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,401.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21.4 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,154.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1) &#8220;Income Before Income Taxes Margin&#8221; is defined as income before income taxes divided by total revenues \n\n(2) A non-GAAP financial measure \n\nNMF = Not a meaningful figure \n\nThe Wholesale Brokerage segment&#8217;s total revenues for 2022 increased 12.4%, or $50.0 million, over 2021, to $453.4 million. The $45.9 million increase in core commissions and fees was driven by the following: (i) approximately $29.7 million of net new and renewal business; (ii) $18.6 million from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2021; and (iii) an offsetting decrease of $2.4 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in the preceding twelve months. Profit-sharing contingent commissions for 2022 increased $4.3 million compared to 2021, to $12.3 million. The Wholesale Brokerage segment&#8217;s growth rate for total commissions and fees was 12.5%, and the Organic Revenue growth rate was 7.6% for 2022. The Organic Revenue growth rate was driven by new business, good retention as well as rate increases for most lines of coverage, which was partially offset by shrinking capacity in the catastrophe exposed personal lines market. \n\nIncome before income taxes for 2022 increased 24.2%, or $22.9 million, over 2021, to $117.7 million, primarily due to the following: (i) the drivers of EBITDAC - Adjusted described below; (ii) decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables; and (iii) lower intercompany interest expense; partially offset by (iv) acquisition/integration costs. \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2022 increased 12.2%, or $15.8 million, from the same period in 2021, to $145.6 million. EBITDAC Margin for 2022 decreased to 32.1% from 32.2% in the same period in 2021. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted decreased due to: (i) higher broker compensation; (ii) increased variable operating expenses, which are primarily travel and meeting related; partially offset by (iii) higher profit-sharing contingent commissions; and (iv) leveraging our expense base in connection with revenue growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nServices Segment \n\nThe Services segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas. The Services segment also provides Medicare Set-aside account services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnlike the other segments, nearly all of the Services segment&#8217;s revenue is generated from fees which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums. \n\nFinancial information relating to our Services segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except percentages) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% Change \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nREVENUES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCore commissions and fees \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n171.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n178.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nProfit-sharing contingent commissions \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n171.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n178.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nEXPENSES \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n90.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n89.7 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther operating expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n48.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(5.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n51.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n(Gain)/loss on disposal \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nAmortization \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nDepreciation \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(27.6 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nChange in estimated acquisition earn-out payables \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n147.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n150.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome before income taxes \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(14.8 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes Margin (1) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.8 \n\n% \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n32.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(13.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n38.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nEBITDAC Margin - Adjusted (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n19.1 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21.2 \n\n% \n\nOrganic Revenue growth rate (2) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2.9 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.1 \n\n% \n\nEmployee compensation and benefits relative to total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n52.7 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n50.2 \n\n% \n\nOther operating expenses relative to total revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n28.2 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n28.6 \n\n% \n\nCapital expenditures \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(37.5 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.6 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal assets at December 31 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n295.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(1.4 \n\n)% \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n299.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) &#8220;Income Before Income Taxes Margin&#8221; is defined as income before income taxes divided by total revenues \n\n(2) A non-GAAP financial measure \n\nNMF = Not a meaningful figure \n\nThe Services segment&#8217;s total revenues for 2022 decreased 3.9%, or $7.0 million, from 2021, to $171.9 million. The $7.0 million decrease in core commissions and fees, was driven by: (i) higher COVID-19 travel restricted claims in 2021; and (ii) a lack of weather-related claims coupled with reduced severity in 2022 and (iii) partially offset by new business resulting in Organic Revenue decreasing by 2.9% in 2022. \n\nIncome before income taxes for 2022 decreased 14.8%, or $4.2 million, from 2021, to $24.1 million due to the drivers of EBITDAC described below. \n\nEBITDAC - Adjusted for 2022 decreased 13.4%, or $5.1 million, from the same period in 2021, to $32.9 million. EBITDAC Margin - Adjusted for 2022 decreased to 19.1% from 21.2% in the same period in 2021. The decrease in EBITDAC and EBITDAC Margin was driven primarily by lower revenues. \n\nOther \n\nAs discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the &#8220;Other&#8221; column in the Segment Information table includes any income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments, and corporate-related items, including the intercompany interest expense charges to reporting segments. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nThe Company seeks to maintain a conservative balance sheet and strong liquidity profile. Our capital requirements to operate as an insurance intermediary are low and we have been able to grow and invest in our business principally through cash that has been generated from operations. We have the ability to utilize our Revolving Credit Facility, which as of December 31, 2022 provided up to $800.0 million in available cash. We believe that we have access to additional funds, if needed, through the capital markets or private placements to obtain further debt financing under the current market conditions. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment portfolio and funds generated from operations, together with the funds available under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Loan Agreement (the &#8220;Loan Agreement&#34;), will be sufficient to satisfy its normal liquidity needs, including principal payments on our long-term debt, for the next twelve months. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains an expansion option for up to an additional $500.0 million of borrowing capacity, subject to the approval of participating lenders. In addition, under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the unsecured term loan in the initial amount of $300.0 million may be increased by up to $150.0 million, subject to the approval of participating lenders. \n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement which provided term loan capacity of $800.0 million. Additionally, the Company may, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of additional term loan commitments by new or existing lenders, increase either Term Loan Commitment under the existing Loan Agreement or the term loans issued thereunder or issue new tranches of term loans in an aggregate additional amount of up to $400.0 million. Including the expansion options under all existing credit agreements, the Company has access to up to $1.9 billion of incremental borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2022. \n\nOur cash and cash equivalents of $650.0 million at December 31, 2022 reflected a decrease of $43.3 million from the $693.2 million balance at December 31, 2021. During 2022, $881.4 million of cash was generated from operating activities, representing an increase of 9.0%.

Earn-out payables for acquisitions not denominated in U.S. dollars are measured at the current foreign exchange rate. Four of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables assumed in connection with the acquisition of GRP included provisions with no maximum potential earn-out amount. The amount recorded for these acquisitions as of December 31, 2022, is $3.0 million. The Company deems a significant increase to this amount to be unlikely. \n\n(3) Does not include approximately $32.6 million of current liability for a dividend of $0.1150 per share approved by the board of directors on January 18, 2023 and paid on February 15, 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nDebt \n\nTotal debt at December 31, 2022 was $3,942.1 million net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, which was an increase of $1,919.2 million compared to December 31, 2021. The increase includes: (i) the issuance of $1,200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes on March 17, 2022, exclusive of debt issuance costs and discounts applied to the principal; (ii) the drawdown of $350.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility in conjunction with the acquisition payment for Orchid on March 31, 2022; (iii) the aggregate drawdown of $800.0 million under the Loan Agreement in connection with the funding of the acquisitions of GRP and BdB which occurred on various dates on or before the final draw on April 28, 2022; and (iv) net of the amortization of discounted debt related to our various unsecured Senior Notes, and debt issuance cost amortization of $3.8 million; offset by decreases due to: (i) the scheduled principal amortization balances related to our various existing floating-rate debt term notes in total of $61.3 million; (ii) added discounted debt balances related to the issuance of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company&#8217;s 4.200% Senior Notes due 2032 (the &#8220;2032 Notes&#8221;) and $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company&#8217;s 4.950% Senior Notes due 2052 (the &#8220;2052 Notes,&#8221; and together with the 2032 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) of $10.4 million; (iii) debt issuance costs related to the Notes and the Loan Agreement of $13.0 million; and (iv) through December 31, 2022 the \n\n&#160; \n\nCompany repaying $350.0 million of debt related to the outstanding amount drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repaid $12.5 million of principal related to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement term loan through the quarterly scheduled amortized principal payments. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement term loan had an outstanding balance of $234.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company's next scheduled amortized principal payment is due March 31, 2023 and is equal to $3.1 million. \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repaid $30.0 million of principal related to the Term Loan Credit Agreement through quarterly scheduled amortized principal payments. The Term Loan Credit Agreement had an outstanding balance of $210.0 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the total term loan balance of $210.0 million is presented under current portion of long-term debt as the agreement and underlying debt instruments are within one-year of maturity. The Company is evaluating options with regard to the loan's remaining balance, including retiring the balance at maturity or refinancing the balance or a portion thereof. The Company&#8217;s next scheduled amortized principal payment is due March 31, 2023 and is equal to $7.5 million. \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company repaid $18.8 million of principal related to the Term Loans issued under the Term A-2 Loan Commitment (&#8220;Term A-2 Loans&#8221;) through quarterly scheduled amortized principal payments. The Term A-2 Loans had an outstanding balance of $481.3 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company&#8217;s next scheduled amortized principal payment is due March 31, 2023 and is equal to $6.3 million. \n\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company completed the issuance of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company&#8217;s 4.200% Senior Notes due 2032 and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company&#8217;s 4.950% Senior Notes due 2052 (and together with the 2032 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). The net proceeds to the Company from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $1,178.2 million. The Senior Notes were given investment grade ratings of BBB- stable outlook and Baa3 stable outlook. The 2032 Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.200% per year and will mature on March 17, 2032. The 2052 Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.950% per year and will mature on March 17, 2052. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company&#8217;s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, at the &#8220;make whole&#8221; redemption prices specified in the Prospectus Supplement for the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding the redemption date. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility, cash on hand and other borrowings, to fund the cash consideration and other amounts payable under the GRP Acquisition Agreement and to pay fees and expenses associated with the foregoing. As of December 31, 2022, there was a total outstanding debt balance of $1,200.0 million exclusive of the associated discount balance on both Notes. \n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement with the lenders named therein, BMO Harris Bank N.A., as administrative agent, Fifth Third Bank, National Association, PNC Bank, National Association, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Truist Securities, Inc., as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers.

The Company may, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of additional term loan commitments by new or existing lenders, increase either Term Loan Commitment or the term loans issued thereunder or issue new tranches of term loans in an aggregate additional amount of up to $400.0 million. The Company may borrow term loans (the &#8220;Term Loans&#8221;) under either of the Term Loan Commitments during the period from the Effective Date (the &#34;Effective Date&#34;) until the date which is the first anniversary thereof. Once borrowed, Term Loans issued under the Term A-1 Loan Commitment (&#8220;Term A-1 Loans&#8221;) are due and payable on the date that is the third anniversary of the Effective Date unless such maturity date is extended as provided under the Loan Agreement. Once borrowed, Term Loans issued under the Term A-2 Loan Commitment (&#8220;Term A-2 Loans&#8221;) are repayable in installments until the fifth anniversary the Effective Date with any remaining outstanding amounts due and payable on such fifth anniversary of the Effective Date unless such maturity date is extended as provided under the Loan Agreement. While outstanding, the undrawn Term Loan Commitments accrue a commitment fee of 0.15% beginning on the earlier of the initial funding of Term Loans under the Loan Agreement and the date that is 120 days from the Effective Date. Once drawn, Term A-1 Loans will bear interest at the annual rate of Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.125% or Base Rate plus 0.125% (subject to a pricing grid for changes in the Company&#8217;s credit rating and/or leverage) and Term A-2 Loans will bear interest at the annual rate of Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.25% or Base Rate plus 0.25% (subject to a pricing grid for changes in the Company&#8217;s credit rating and/or leverage).

      "text": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our investments, revolving credit line, term loan agreements and international operations. \n\nOur invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, available-for-sale marketable debt securities, non-marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, and professionally managed short duration fixed income funds. These investments are subject to interest rate risk. The fair value of our invested assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximated their respective carrying values due to their short-term duration and therefore, such market risk is not considered to be material. \n\nWe do not actively invest or trade in equity securities. In addition, we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $781.2 million outstanding under the Loan Agreement tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) and $444.4 million of borrowings outstanding under certain credit agreements tied to the overnight London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). These aforementioned notes bear interest on a floating basis and are therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of July 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) has urged banks and institutions to discontinue their use of the LIBOR benchmark rate for floating-rate debt, and other financial instruments tied to the rate after 2021. However, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (&#8220;IBA&#8221;), announced that it would consult in early December 2020 on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (overnight and one, three, six and twelve months) immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. In connection to the released statement from the IBA, on December 4, 2020, the FCA released a similar statement in support of the continuation of the LIBOR rate beyond 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as the best alternative rate to LIBOR post discontinuance and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR from LIBOR. Post consultation on March 5, 2021, IBA confirmed its proposed dates to stop publishing the London interbank offered rate for dollars (&#34;USD LIBOR&#34;) on a representative basis. \n\nWhen the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit on October 27, 2021, it included provisions regarding transition from LIBOR to SOFR in preparation of the LIBOR cessation. On March 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement which bears interest tied to the annual rate for the adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#34;Adjusted Term SOFR&#34;). In the coming periods, \n\n&#160; \n\nthe Company will assess any other current agreements with benchmark rates tied to LIBOR with an expectation that the Company will be prepared for a termination of LIBOR benchmarks prior to June 30, 2023 when typical rate settings will no longer be available. \n\nThe majority of our international operations do not have material transactions in currencies other than their functional currency which would expose the Company to transactional currency rate risk. We are subject to translational exchange rate risk having businesses operating outside of the U.S. in the following functional currencies, British pounds, Canadian dollar and euros. Based upon our foreign currency rate exposure as of December 31, 2022, an immediate 10% hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\n"

Refer to Note 13 for reconciliations of cash and cash equivalents inclusive of fiduciary cash. \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nNOTE 1 Summary of Signif icant Accounting Policies \n\nNature of Operations \n\nBrown &#38; Brown, Inc., a Florida corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Brown &#38; Brown&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and service organization that markets and sells insurance products and services, primarily in the property, casualty and employee benefits areas. Brown &#38; Brown&#8217;s business is divided into four reportable segments. The Retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public entities, professional and individual insured customers, and non-insurance risk-mitigating products through our automobile and recreational vehicle dealer services (&#8220;F&#38;I&#8221;) businesses. The National Programs segment, which acts as a managing general agent (&#8220;MGA&#8221;), provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through a nationwide network of independent agents, including Brown &#38; Brown retail agents. The Wholesale Brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, as well as Brown &#38; Brown retail agents. The Services segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services. \n\nThe Company primarily operates as an agent or broker not assuming underwriting risks. However, we operate a write-your-own flood insurance carrier, Wright National Flood Insurance Company (&#8220;WNFIC&#8221;). WNFIC&#8217;s underwriting business consists of policies written pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program (&#8220;NFIP&#8221;), the program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;) to which premiums and underwriting exposure are ceded and excess flood and private flood policies which are fully reinsured in the private market. The Company also participates in two capitalized captive insurance facilities (the &#34;Captives&#34;) for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity, generating incremental revenues and participating in underwriting results. \n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#34;FASB&#34;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#34;ASU&#34;) 2020-04, &#34;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.&#34; The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. These amendments, along with the amendments within ASU 2022-06 &#34;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848&#34; that extended the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance in Topic 848, are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating our contracts and the available expedients provided by the new standard; however, the Company can assert there is no impact to any carrying value of assets or liabilities aside from our floating-rate debt instruments that are indexed to LIBOR and are carried at amortized cost. Any further impact of adoption will be in determining the new periodic floating interest rate indexed to our floating-rate debt instruments with no impact on the balance sheet upon adoption. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 , &#8220;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.&#8221; The standard removes specific exceptions in the current rules and eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: (a) exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; (b) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (c) exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The standard also is designed to improve financial statement preparers&#8217; application of income tax-related guidance and simplify GAAP for (a) franchise taxes that are partially based on income; (b) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill; (c) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax and (d) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021 . The impact of adopting this standard was no t material to the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Brown &#38; Brown, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company earns commissions paid by insurance carriers for the binding of insurance coverage. Commissions are earned at a point in time upon the effective date of bound insurance coverage, as no performance obligation exists after coverage is bound. If there are other services within the contract, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling price for each separate performance obligation, and the corresponding apportioned revenue is recognized over a period of time as the performance obligations are fulfilled. The Company earns fee revenue by receiving negotiated fees in lieu of a commission and from services other than securing insurance coverage. Fee revenues from certain agreements are recognized depending on when the services within the contract are satisfied and when we have transferred control of the related services to the customer. In situations where multiple performance obligations exist within a fee contract, in some instances the use of estimates is required to allocate the transaction price on a relative stand-alone selling price basis to each separate performance obligation. Other supplemental commissions represent a form of variable consideration which includes additional commissions over base commissions received from insurance carriers based on predetermined production levels mutually agreed upon by both parties. Profit-sharing contingent commissions represent a form of variable consideration associated with the placement of coverage, for which we earn commissions. Profit-sharing contingent commissions and other supplemental commissions are estimated with a constraint applied and accrued relative to the recognition of the corresponding core commissions based on the amount of consideration that will be received in the coming year such that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. Guaranteed supplemental commissions, a form of variable consideration within other supplemental commissions, represent guaranteed fixed-base agreements in lieu of profit-sharing contingent commissions. \n\nManagement determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted for any known circumstances. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nCash and cash equivalents principally consist of demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with quoted market prices having maturities of three months or less when purchased. \n\nFiduciary Cash, Commissions, Fees and Other Receivables, Fiduciary Receivables, and Fiduciary Liabilities \n\nBeginning January 1, 2022 the Company is presenting certain assets and liabilities that arise from activities in which the Company engages as an intermediary, where we collect premiums from insureds to remit to insurance companies, hold funds from insurance companies to distribute to insureds for claims on covered losses and hold refunds due to customers as fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities. \n\nUncollected premiums are no longer presented in the same caption with commissions, fees and other receivables, but rather represented in a separate caption as fiduciary receivables. Likewise, payables to insurance companies and premium deposits due customers are now combined into a new caption as fiduciary liabilities. \n\nThe caption &#8220;restricted cash&#8221; is now reflected as &#8220;fiduciary cash&#8221; along with non-restricted fiduciary cash balances previously reported within &#8220;cash and cash equivalents.&#8221; Fiduciary cash represents funds in the Company's possession collected from customers to be remitted to insurance companies and funds from insurance companies to be distributed to insureds for the settlement of claims or refunds. The net change in fiduciary cash is represented by the net change in fiduciary liabilities and fiduciary receivables and is presented as cash flows from financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Previously the net change in cash balances held to remit to insurance carriers or to return to customers was presented as cash flows from operating activities. \n\nAll prior periods included in these financial statements have been recast to conform to this basis of presentation. The relevant balance sheet captions and how the December 31, 2021 balances as presented under the prior method relate to the current presentation are reflected in the tables below. Certain liabilities reported as premiums payable to insurance companies or within premiums deposits and credits due customers were deemed not to be fiduciary in nature and have been included within accounts payable in the current presentation. Likewise, a small component of accounts payable was deemed to be fiduciary in nature and is now included within fiduciary liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\nAs reported \n\n&#160;

is now shown as &#34;Commissions, fees and other receivables&#34; in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nUnremitted net insurance premiums are held in a fiduciary capacity until the Company disburses them, and the use of such funds is restricted by laws in certain jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, or restricted due to our contracts with a certain insurance company or companies in which we hold premiums in a fiduciary capacity. Where allowed by law, the Company invests these unremitted funds only in cash, money market accounts, tax-free variable-rate demand bonds and commercial paper held for a short-term. In certain states in which the Company operates, the use and investment alternatives for these funds are regulated and restricted by various state laws and agencies. The interest income earned on these unremitted funds, where allowed by state law, is reported as investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nIn other circumstances, the insurance companies collect the premiums directly from the insureds and remit the applicable commissions to the Company. Accordingly, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, commissions are receivables from insurance companies. Fees are primarily receivables due from customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestments \n\nCertificates of deposit, and other securities, having maturities of more than three months when purchased are reported at cost and are adjusted for other-than-temporary market value declines. The Company&#8217;s investment holdings include U.S. Government securities, municipal bonds, domestic corporate and foreign corporate bonds as well as short-duration fixed income funds. Investments within the portfolio or funds are held as available-for-sale and are carried at their fair value. Any gain/loss applicable from the fair value change is recorded, net of tax, as other comprehensive income within the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses are reported as investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income, with the cost of securities sold determined on a specific identification basis. \n\nFixed Assets \n\nFixed assets, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts. Depreciation has been determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3 to 40 years . Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease. \n\nGoodwill and Amortizable Intangible Assets \n\nAll of our business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average annual EBITDAC (defined below), and/or revenue earned over a period of 3 years within a minimum and maximum price range. The recorded purchase prices for acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred. \n\nThe fair value of earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, the acquired business&#8217; future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. The expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. These estimates are then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecast earn-out payments will be made. \n\nAmortizable intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and consist of purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements. Purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which typically range from 3 to 15 years. Purchased customer accounts represent the value of the customer relationship, but also consist of records and files that contain information about insurance policies and the related insured parties that are essential to policy renewals. \n\nThe excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and amortizable intangible assets is assigned to goodwill. While goodwill is not amortizable, it is subject to assessment at least annually, and more frequently in the presence of certain circumstances, for impairment by application of a fair value-based test. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill. The Company may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment, or as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is not determined that the fair value of the reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying amount, the Company will calculate the fair value of the reporting unit for comparison against the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables (&#8220;EBITDAC&#8221;), or on a discounted cash flow basis. The Company completed its most recent annual assessment as of November 30, 2022 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 , there are no accumulated impairment losses. \n\nThe carrying value of amortizable intangible assets attributable to each business or asset group comprising the Company is periodically reviewed by management to determine if there are events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Accordingly, if there are any such changes in circumstances during the year, the Company assesses the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets by considering the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the corresponding business or asset group. Any impairment identified through this assessment may require that the carrying value of related amortizable intangible assets be adjusted after determining the fair value of the amortizable intangible assets. There were no impairments recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 . \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company records income tax expense using the asset-and-liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and the income tax bases of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. \n\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and has elected to file consolidated returns in certain states. Deferred income taxes are provided for in the Consolidated Financial Statements and relate principally to expenses charged to income for financial reporting purposes in one period and deducted for income tax purposes in other periods. \n\nNet Income Per Share \n\nBasic net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares (including participating securities) issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding plus equivalent shares, assuming the issuance of all potentially issuable common shares. The dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares is computed by application of the treasury stock method. \n\nThe following is a reconciliation between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended December 31: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions, except per share data) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n671.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n587.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n480.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income attributable to unvested awarded performance stock \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 12.7 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 12.9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 15.2 \n\n) \n\nNet income attributable to common shares \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n659.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n574.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n465.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding &#8211; basic \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n282.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n282.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n283.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nLess unvested awarded performance stock included in weighted average number of common shares outstanding &#8211; basic \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 5.4 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 6.2 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 9.0 \n\n) \n\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic earnings per common share \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n277.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n276.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n274.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nDilutive effect of stock options \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.5 \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding &#8211; diluted \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n278.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n277.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n275.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet income per share: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBasic \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.38 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.08 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.70 \n\n&#160; \n\nDiluted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.37 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2.07 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.69 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents; fiduciary cash; short-term investments; investments; fiduciary receivables, commissions, fees and other receivables; reinsurance recoverable; prepaid reinsurance premiums; fiduciary liabilities; losses and loss adjustment reserve; unearned premium; accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company&#8217;s long-term debt approximates fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 as our fixed-rate borrowings of $ 2,738.8 million approximate their values using market quotes of notes with the similar terms as ours, which we deem a close approximation of current market rates. The estimated fair value of our variable floating rate debt agreements is $ 1,225.6 million which approximates the carrying value due to the variable interest rate based upon adjusted LIBOR and SOFR. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair values related to the establishment of intangible assets and the establishment and adjustment of earn-out payables. See Note 6 for information on the fair value of investments and Note 9 for information on the fair value of long-term debt. \n\nNon-Cash Stock-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company has stock-based compensation plans that provide for grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options and other stock-based awards to employees and non-employee directors of the Company. In addition, the Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows employees to purchase shares in the Company. The Company expenses stock-based compensation, which is included in Employee compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the requisite service period. The significant assumptions underlying our expense calculations include the fair value of the award on the date of grant, the estimated achievement of any performance targets and estimated forfeiture rates. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model for valuing all stock options and shares purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#8220;ESPP&#8221;). Compensation for non-vested stock awards is measured at fair value on the grant date based upon the number of shares expected to vest. Compensation cost for all awards is recognized in earnings, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. \n\nReinsurance \n\nThe Company acts in a risk-bearing capacity for flood insurance associated with the Wright National Flood Insurance Company (&#8220;WNFIC&#8221;), which is part of our National Programs segment. The Company protects itself from claims-related losses by reinsuring all claims risk exposure. However, for basic admitted policies conforming to the National Flood Insurance Program all exposure is reinsured with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;). For excess flood and private flood insurance policies, all exposure is reinsured with a reinsurance carrier with an AM Best Company rating of &#8220;A&#8221; or better. Reinsurance does not legally discharge the ceding insurer from the primary liability for the full amount due under the reinsured policies. Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursement and reserves related to ceded business are accounted for on a basis consistent with the accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of reinsurance contracts. Premiums earned and losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred are reported net of reinsurance amounts. Other underwriting expenses are shown net of earned ceding commission income. The liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums are reported gross of ceded reinsurance recoverable. \n\nBalances due from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including an estimate of such that is recoverable related to reserves for incurred but not reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;) losses, are reported as assets and are included in reinsurance recoverable even though amounts due on unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense are not recoverable from the reinsurer until such losses are paid. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any material credit risk through its reinsurance as the reinsurer is FEMA for basic admitted flood policies and national reinsurance carriers for private flood policies, which has an AM Best Company rating of &#8220;A&#8221; or better. Historically, no amounts due from reinsurance carriers have been written off as uncollectible. \n\nThe Company also participates in two Captives for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity, generating additional revenues and participating in underwriting results. One Captive operates on a quota share basis, currently focused on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties for policies placed by certain of our MGA businesses. This Captive buys reinsurance, limiting, but not fully eliminating the Company's exposure to claims expenses. The other Captive operates through an-excess of loss or reinsurance layers associated with placements made by one of our MGA businesses focused on residential property primarily in the southeastern United States. This Captive has capped exposure through contractual aggregate limits on the reinsurance participations it assumes with one layer of per risk excess reinsurance and three layers of catastrophe per occurrence reinsurance. All four layers have limited reinstatements and therefore have capped, maximum aggregate limits. \n\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Reserve \n\nUnpaid losses and loss adjustment reserve includes amounts determined on individual claims and other estimates based upon the past experience and the policyholders for IBNR claims, less anticipated salvage and subrogation recoverable. The methods of making such estimates and for establishing the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated, and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operations currently. \n\nThe Company engages the services of outside actuarial consulting firms (the &#8220;Actuaries&#8221;) to assist on an annual basis to render an opinion on the sufficiency of the Company&#8217;s estimates for unpaid losses and related loss adjustment reserve. The Actuaries utilize both industry experience and the Company&#8217;s own experience to develop estimates of those amounts as of year-end. These estimated liabilities are subject to the impact of future changes in claim severity, frequency and other factors. In spite of the variability inherent in such estimates, management believes that the liabilities for unpaid losses and related loss adjustment reserve are adequate. \n\n&#160; \n\nPremiums are recognized as income over the coverage period of the related policies. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of the policies in force and are determined on a daily pro rata basis. The income is recorded to the commissions and fees line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n\nNOTE 2 Revenues \n\nThe following tables present the revenues disaggregated by revenue source: \n\n&#160;

underlying &#8220;insurable exposure units,&#8221; which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, or sales and payroll levels) to determine what \n\n&#160; \n\npremium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control. \n\n(2) Fee revenues relate to fees for services other than securing coverage for our customers, fees negotiated in lieu of commissions, and F&#38;I products and services. \n\n(3) Other supplemental commissions include additional commissions over base commissions received from insurance carriers based on predetermined growth or production measures. This includes incentive commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions. \n\n(4) Profit-sharing contingent commissions are based primarily on underwriting results, but may also reflect considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. \n\n(5) Earned premium relates to the premiums earned in the Captives. \n\n(6) Investment income consists primarily of interest on cash and investments. \n\n(7) Other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income. \n\n(8) Fees within Other reflects the elimination of intercompany revenues . \n\nRevenues Disaggregated by Geography \n\nThe following table presents the revenues disaggregated by geographic area where our services are being performed: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nU.S. \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,332.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,973.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,578.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nU.K. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n170.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n15.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n12.7 \n\n&#160; \n\nIreland \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n38.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n34.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nCanada \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n23.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n21.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n16.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Revenues \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,573.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,051.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,613.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nContract Assets and Liabilities \n\nThe balances of contract assets and contract liabilities arising from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nContract assets \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n431.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n361.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nContract liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n113.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n97.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nUnbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which have not yet been billed in our systems and are reflected in commissions, fees and other receivables in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in contract assets over the balance as of December 31, 2021 is due to growth in our business and from businesses acquired in the current year. \n\nDeferred revenue (contract liabilities) relates to payments received in advance of performance under the contract before the transfer of a good or service to the customer. Deferred revenue is reflected within accrued expenses and other liabilities for those to be recognized in less than 12 months and in other liabilities for those to be recognized more than 12 months from the date presented in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, deferred revenue consisted of $ 79.9 million as current portion to be recognized within one year and $ 33.4 million in long-term to be recognized beyond one year. As of December 31, 2021, deferred revenue consisted of $ 67.4 million as current portion to be recognized within one year and $ 30.5 million in long-term deferred revenue to be recognized beyond one year. \n\nContract assets and contract liabilities arising from acquisitions in 2022 were approximately $ 12.0 million and $ 4.4 million , respectively. Contract assets and contract liabilities arising from acquisitions in 2021 were approximately $ 5.5 million and $ 1.2 million , respectively. \n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the amount of revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in a previous period, inclusive of changes due to estimates, was approximately $ 25.8 million , $ 23.3 million , and $ 8.9 million, respectively. The $ 25.8 million and $ 23.3 million for 2022 and 2021 consists of additional variable consideration received on our incentive and profit-sharing contingent commissions, respectively. The $ 8.9 million for 2020 consists of $ 18.1 million of additional variable consideration received on our incentive and profit-sharing contingent commissions, offset by $ 7.1 million of revised estimates related to variable consideration on policies where the exposure units were expected to be impacted by COVID-19 and $ 2.1 million of other adjustments. \n\nOther Assets and Deferred Cost \n\n&#160; \n\nIncremental cost to obtain &#8211; The Company defers certain costs to obtain customer contracts primarily as they relate to commission-based compensation plans in the Retail segment, in which the Company pays an incremental amount of compensation on new business. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a 15 -year period. The cost to obtain balance within the Other assets caption in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 76.0 million and $ 58.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company deferred $ 23.0 million and $ 19.8 million of incremental cost to obtain customer contracts, respectively. The Company recorded an expense of $ 5.2 million and $ 3.8 million associated with the incremental cost to obtain customer contracts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. \n\nCost to fulfill - The Company defers certain costs to fulfill contracts and recognizes these costs as the associated performance obligations are fulfilled. The cost to fulfill balance within the other current assets caption in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 108.7 million as of December 31, 2022, which is inclusive of deferrals from businesses acquired in the current year of $ 14.1 million. The cost to fulfill balance as of December 31, 2021 was $ 89.3 million, which is inclusive of deferrals from businesses acquired in the year of $ 9.9 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had net deferrals of $ 6.7 million and $ 1.6 million related to current year deferrals for costs incurred that relate to performance obligations yet to be fulfilled, net of the expense of previously deferred contract fulfillment costs associated with performance obligations that were satisfied in the period, respectively. \n\nNOTE 3 Busines s Combinations \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 12 insurance intermediaries, all the stock of 11 insurance intermediaries, and 7 books of businesses (customer accounts). Additionally, adjustments were recorded to the purchase price allocation of certain prior acquisitions completed within the last 12 months as permitted by ASC Topic 805 - Business Combinations (&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;). Such adjustments are presented in the &#8220;Other&#8221; category within the following two tables. The recorded purchase price for all acquisitions includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations will be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred. \n\nThe fair value of earn-out obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, the acquired business&#8217;s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. The expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. These payments are then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earn-out payments will be made. \n\nBased on the acquisition date and the complexity of the underlying valuation work, certain amounts included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements may be provisional and thus subject to further adjustments within the permitted measurement period, as defined in ASC 805. For the year ended December 31, 2022, adjustments were made within the permitted measurement period that resulted in a decrease in the aggregate purchase price of the affected acquisitions of $ 0.1 million . These measurement period adjustments have been reflected as current period adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2022. The measurement period adjustments primarily impacted goodwill, with no effect on earnings or cash in the current period. \n\nGross cash paid for acquisitions was $ 2,544.4 million and $ 424.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We completed 30 acquisitions (including book of business purchases) during the year ended December 31, 2022. We completed 19 acquisitions (including book of business purchases) during the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price allocations made as of the date of each acquisition for current year acquisitions and adjustments made during the measurement period for prior year acquisitions. During the measurement periods, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. These adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nName \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness segment \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective date of acquisition \n\n&#160; \n\nCash paid \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommon stock issued \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nRecorded earn-out payable \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet assets acquired \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nMaximum potential earn-out payable \n\n&#160; \n\nOrchid Underwriters Agency, LLC (Orchid) \n\n&#160; \n\nNational Programs \n\n&#160; \n\nMarch 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n476.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n10.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n487.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nGRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited (GRP) \n\n&#160; \n\nRetail National Programs Wholesale \n\n&#160; \n\nJuly 1, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,839.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n14.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,854.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nFirst Insurance Solutions Ltd.

and non-compete agreements, 4.1 years. \n\nGoodwill of $ 1,994.5 million, which is net of any opening balance sheet adjustments within the allowable measurement period, was allocated to the Retail, National Programs, and Wholesale Brokerage segments in the amounts of $ 1,366.6 million , $ 516.5 million , and $ 111.4 million , respectively. Of the total goodwill of $ 1,994.5 million, the amount currently deductible for income tax purposes is $ 74.4 million . Of the remaining $ 1,920.1 million of goodwill, $ 1,913.8 million relates to goodwill that will not be deductible for income tax purposes and $ 6.3 million relates to recorded earn-out payables which will not be deductible for income tax purposes until it is earned and paid. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the acquisitions completed during 2022, the results of operations since the acquisition dates have been combined with those of the Company. The total revenues from the acquisitions completed through December 31, 2022 included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $ 217.1 million . The income before income taxes from the acquisitions completed through December 31, 2022, included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $ 8.8 million .

Of the total goodwill of $ 648.1 million, $ 516.7 million is currently deductible for income tax purposes. The remaining $ 131.4 million relates to the recorded earn-out payables and will not be deductible until it is earned and paid. \n\nFor the acquisitions completed during 2020, the results of operations since the acquisition dates have been combined with those of the Company. The total revenues from the acquisitions completed through December 31, 2020 included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $ 93.9 million . The income before income taxes, including the intercompany cost of capital charge, from the acquisitions completed through December 31, 2020 included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 7.5 million .

Additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. The recorded purchase prices for acquisitions include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations will be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred or reasonably estimated. Estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were re-evaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in ASC 820- Fair Value Measurement .

A subsidiary of the Company is currently under audit in the State of Wisconsin for the fiscal years 2017-2020 and with the Internal Revenue Service for the fiscal years 2018-2020. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company came under audit in the state of Massachusetts for the fiscal years 2018-2020. A subsidiary of the Company is currently under audit in the State of Missouri for the fiscal years 2019-2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. The Company has determined it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on the undistributed earnings from the Company&#8217;s international subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. \n\nNOTE 11 Employ ee Savings Plan \n\nThe Company has an Employee Savings Plan (401(k)) in which substantially all employees with more than 30 days of service are eligible to participate. Under this plan, the Company makes matching contributions of up to 4.0 % of each participant&#8217;s annual compensation. The Company&#8217;s contribution expense to the plan totaled $ 42.7 million in 2022 and $ 35.6 million in 2021 . \n\nNOTE 12 Stock-Ba sed Compensation \n\nPerformance Stock Plan \n\nIn 1996, the Company adopted and the shareholders approved a performance stock plan, under which until the suspension of the plan in 2010, up to 28,800,000 Performance Stock Plan (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) shares could be granted to key employees contingent on the employees&#8217; future years of service with the Company and other performance-based criteria established by the Compensation Committee of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. Before participants may take full title to Performance Stock, two vesting conditions must be met. Of the grants currently outstanding, specified portions satisfied the first condition for vesting based upon 20 % incremental increases in the 20-trading-day average stock price of Brown &#38; Brown&#8217;s common stock from the price on the last business day before date of grant. Performance Stock that has satisfied the first vesting condition is considered &#8220;awarded shares.&#8221; Awarded shares are included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and are included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share. Dividends are paid on awarded shares and participants may exercise voting privileges on such shares. Awarded shares satisfy the second condition for vesting on the earlier of a participant&#8217;s: (i) 15 years of continuous employment with Brown &#38; Brown from the date shares are granted to the participants (or, in the case of the July 2009 grant to Powell Brown, 20 years ), (ii) attainment of age 64 (on a prorated basis corresponding to the number of years since the date of grant), or (iii) death or disability. On April 28, 2010, the PSP was suspended and any remaining authorized, but unissued shares, as well as any shares forfeited in the future, were reserved for issuance under the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2010 SIP&#8221;). \n\nAt December 31, 2022, 10,163,420 shares had been granted, net of forfeitures, under the PSP. As of December 31, 2022, 708,380 shares had met the first condition of vesting and had been awarded, and 9,455,040 shares had satisfied both conditions of vesting and had been distributed to participants. Of the shares that have not vested as of December 31, 2022, the initial stock prices ranged from $ 8.30 to $ 10.31 . \n\nThe Company uses a path-dependent lattice model to estimate the fair value of PSP grants on the grant date. \n\nA summary of PSP activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- average grant date fair value \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted shares \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAwarded shares \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares not yet awarded \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at January 1, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.00 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,051,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,051,292 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nAwarded \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6.06 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 119,072 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 119,072 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.03 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 22,392 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 22,392 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.86 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n909,828 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n909,828 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nAwarded \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 45,736 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 45,736 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.50 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 24,250 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 24,250 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.87 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n839,842 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n839,842 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nAwarded \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.81 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 101,900 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 101,900 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.80 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 29,562 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 29,562 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4.88 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n708,380 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n708,380 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nThe total fair value of PSP grants that vested during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 6.3 million , $ 2.3 million and $ 5.0 million , respectively. \n\nStock Incentive Plans \n\nOn April 28, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;2010 SIP&#8221;), which was suspended May 1, 2019. On May 1, 2019, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;2019 SIP&#8221;) that provides for the granting of \n\n&#160; \n\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards to employees and directors contingent on performance-based and/or time-based criteria established by the Compensation Committee of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. In addition, the 2019 SIP provides for a limited delegation of authority of the Company&#8217;s chief executive officer to grant awards to individuals who are not subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The principal purpose of the 2019 SIP is to attract, incentivize and retain key employees by offering those persons an opportunity to acquire or increase a direct proprietary interest in the Company&#8217;s operations and future success. The number of shares of stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 SIP is 2,283,475 shares, plus any shares that are authorized for issuance under the 2010 SIP (described below), and not already subject to grants under the 2010 SIP, and that were outstanding as of May 1, 2019, the date of suspension of the 2010 SIP, together with PSP shares, 2010 SIP shares and 2019 SIP shares forfeited after that date. As of May 1, 2019, 6,957,897 shares were available for issuance under the 2010 SIP, which were then transferred to the 2019 SIP. \n\nThe Company has granted restricted share awards (including both restricted stock and restricted stock units) to our employees in the form of time-based grants and performance-based grants under the 2010 SIP and 2019 SIP. To date, a substantial majority of restricted share grants to employees under these plans vest in 5 to 10 years . The performance-based grants are subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria by grantees, which may include growth in a defined book of business, Organic Revenue growth and operating profit growth of a profit center, Organic Revenue growth of the Company and consolidated diluted net income per share growth at certain levels of the Company. The performance measurement period ranges from 3 to 5 years . Beginning in 2016, certain performance-based grants have a payout range between 0 % to 200 % depending on the achievement against the stated performance target. Prior to 2016, the majority of the grants had a binary performance measurement criteria that only allowed for 0 % or 100 % payout. \n\nNon-employee members of the board of directors received shares annually issued pursuant to the 2019 SIP as part of their annual compensation. A total of 16,490 shares were issued in May 2020, 16,857 shares were issued in May 2021 and 15,003 shares were issued in May 2022. \n\nThe Company uses the closing stock price on the day before the grant date to determine the fair value of grants under the 2010 SIP and 2019 SIP and then applies an estimated forfeiture factor to estimate the annual expense. Additionally, the Company uses the path-dependent lattice model to estimate the fair value of grants with PSP-type vesting conditions as of the grant date. SIP shares that satisfied the first vesting condition for PSP-type grants or the established performance criteria are considered awarded shares. Awarded shares under restricted stock awards are included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and are included in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share. \n\nA summary of 2010 SIP and 2019 SIP activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted- average grant date fair value \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted shares \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAwarded shares \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nShares not yet awarded \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at January 1, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n18.10 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n11,641,918 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8,070,576 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,571,342 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n46.58 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n970,997 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n148,015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n822,982 \n\n&#160; \n\n(1) \n\nAwarded \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19.71 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n497,082 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,880,512 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1,383,430 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15.97 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 3,059,619 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 3,059,619 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20.75 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 356,041 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 119,637 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 236,404 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2020 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n19.89 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,694,337 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6,919,847 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,774,490 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n46.05 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,143,094 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n204,826 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n938,268 \n\n&#160; \n\n(2) \n\nAwarded \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25.80 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n310,147 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,272,554 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 962,407 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 3,223,964 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 3,223,964 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n30.54 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 315,168 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 147,702 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 167,466 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n21.59 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,608,446 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5,025,561 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,582,885 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGranted \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n65.22 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,478,613 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n693,802 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n784,811 \n\n&#160; \n\n(3) \n\nAwarded \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n28.73 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n470,793 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,383,216 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 912,423 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nVested \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n20.09 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 2,179,476 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 2,179,476 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nForfeited \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n37.78 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 313,428 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 168,454 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 144,974 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n25.01 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n7,064,948 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,754,649 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,310,299 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n(1) Of the 822,982 p erformance-based shares granted in 2020, the payout for 365,606 shares may be increased up to 200 % of the target or decreased to zero , 20,611 shares may be increased up to 120 % of the target or decreased to zero , 15,850 shares may be increased up to 150 % of the target or decreased to zero and 56,226 shares may be increased up to 150 % or decreased to 50 % of target subject to the level of performance attained.

Employees of the Company who regularly work 20 hours or more per week are generally eligible to participate in the ESPP. Participants, through payroll deductions, may allot up to 10 % of their compensation towards the purchase of a maximum of $ 25,000 worth of Company stock between August 1 st of each year and the following July 31 st (the &#8220;Subscription Period&#8221;) at a cost of 85 % of the lower of the stock price as of the beginning or end of the Subscription Period. \n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of an ESPP share option as of the beginning of the Subscription Period as the sum of: (i) 15 % of the quoted market price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the day prior to the beginning of the Subscription Period, and (ii) 85 % of the value of a one-year stock option on the Company stock using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of an ESPP share option as of the Subscription Period beginning in August 2022 was $ 15.81 . The fair values of an ESPP share option as of the Subscription Periods beginning in August 2021 and 2020, were $ 11.60 and $ 12.43 , respectively. \n\nFor the ESPP plan years ended July 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 791,842 , 850,956 and 962,131 shares of common stock, respectively. These shares were issued at an aggregate purchase price of $ 36.5 million , or $ 46.10 per share, in 2022, $ 32.9 million , or $ 38.70 per share, in 2021 and $ 29.3 million , or $ 30.51 per share, in 2020. \n\nFor the five months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (portions of the 2022-2023, 2021-2022 and 2020-2021 plan years), 338,498 , 354,911 and 381,371 shares of common stock (from authorized but unissued shares), respectively, were subscribed to by ESPP participants for proceeds of approximately $ 18.2 million , $ 16.4 million and $ 14.8 million , respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nSummary of Non-Cash Stock-Based Compensation Expense \n\nThe non-cash stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nStock incentive plan \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n55.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n50.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n50.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nEmployee stock purchase plan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n10.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n8.7 \n\n&#160; \n\nPerformance stock plan \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n66.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n61.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n59.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nSummary of Unamortized Compensation Expense \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates there to be $ 164.3 million of unamortized compensation expense related to all non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation plans, based upon current projections of grant measurement against performance criteria. That expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.67 years. \n\nNOTE 13 Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Inform ation and Non-Cash Financing and Investing Activities \n\nThroughout 2020, the Company deferred $ 31.1 million in employer-only payroll tax payments as allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES&#8221; Act), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. During 2022, there were no additional deferrals under the CARES Act. The Company paid the first installment of approximately $ 15.6 million in December 2021 and the second installment of approximately $ 15.6 million in December 2022. \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the Company received an $ 8.1 million reimbursement for capitalizable costs of public infrastructure improvements related to the construction of the Company's headquarters in accordance with an economic development grant agreement between the Company and the City of Daytona Beach and Volusia County. The reimbursement has been reflected as a reduction to the additions to fixed asset line item on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\nDuring 2022, the company had an impact of $ 131.2 million of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents inclusive of fiduciary cash reported on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows which is primarily due to the decrease in currency exchange rates for British pounds and an additional smaller impact from the decline in currency exchange rates related to euro and Canadian dollar. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cash paid during the period for interest and income taxes are summarized as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash paid during the period for: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n120.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n61.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n52.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome taxes, net of refunds \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n122.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n146.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n131.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s significant non-cash investing and financing activities are summarized as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#160; \n\n(in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther payables issued for agency acquisitions and purchased customer accounts \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n15.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimated acquisition earn-out payables and related charges \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n73.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n75.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n131.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nAssumed acquisition earn-out payables \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n34.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nContingent payable issued for agency acquisition \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n24.1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nCommon stock issued for agency acquisition \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n14.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n9.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\nNotes payable assumed for agency acquisition \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.8 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOur fiduciary cash balance is composed of funds held in separate premium trust accounts as required by state law or, in some cases, per agreement with our carrier partners.

In accordance with ASC Topic 450- Contingencies , the Company accrues anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based upon historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, the Company expenses these costs as incurred. If the best estimate of a probable loss is a range rather than a specific amount, the Company accrues the amount at the lower end of the range. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s accruals for legal matters that were probable and estimable were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operating results, cash flows and overall liquidity. The Company maintains third-party insurance policies to provide coverage for certain legal claims, in an effort to mitigate its overall exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, as (i) one or more of the Company&#8217;s insurance carriers could take the position that portions of these claims are not covered by the Company&#8217;s insurance, (ii) to the extent that payments are made to resolve claims and lawsuits, applicable insurance policy limits are eroded and (iii) the claims and lawsuits relating to these matters are continuing to develop, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by unfavorable resolutions of these matters. Based upon the AM Best Company ratings of these third-party insurers, management does not believe there is a substantial risk of an insurer&#8217;s material non-performance related to any current insured claims. \n\nOn the basis of current information, the availability of insurance and legal advice, in management&#8217;s opinion, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations and/or cash flows. \n\nNOTE 15 Leases \n\nSubstantially all of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases and primarily represent real estate leases for office space used to conduct the Company's business that expire on various dates through 2041 . Leases generally contain renewal options and escalation clauses based upon increases in the lessors&#8217; operating expenses and other charges. The Company anticipates that most of these leases will be renewed or replaced upon expiration. \n\nThe Company assesses at inception of a contract if it contains a lease. This assessment is based on: (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is primarily composed of the initial lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the minimum lease payments through the term of the lease. Minimum lease payments are discounted to present value using the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date, which approximates the rate of interest the Company expects to pay on a secured borrowing in an amount equal to the lease payments for the underlying asset under similar terms and economic conditions. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a total term of twelve months or less. The effect of short-term leases on the Company&#8217;s right-of-use asset and lease liability would not be significant. The balances and classification of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDecember 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nBalance Sheet \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n214.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n197.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal assets \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating lease assets \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n214.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n197.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nLiabilities: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCurrent operating lease liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n45.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n43.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-current operating lease liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating lease liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n195.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n180.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n240.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n223.4 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has entered into future lease agreements expected to commence in 2023 consisting of undiscounted lease liabilities of $ 12.4 million. \n\nVariable lease cost represents lease payments that are based on an index or similar rate. They are initially measured using the index or rate in effect at lease commencement and are based on the minimum payments stated in the lease. Additional payments based on the change in an index or rate, or payments based on a change in the Company's portion of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes and insurance, are recorded as a period expense when incurred. \n\nLease expense for operating leases consists of the lease payments, inclusive of lease incentives, plus any initial direct costs, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. \n\nThe components of lease cost for operating leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating leases: \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nLease cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n55.5 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n52.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nVariable lease cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4.3 \n\n&#160; \n\nShort-term lease cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n0.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.1 \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating lease cost \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n60.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n58.2 \n\n&#160; \n\nSublease income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1.5 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n( 1.6 \n\n) \n\nTotal lease cost net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n59.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n56.6 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases as of December 31, 2022 were: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Weighted average remaining lease term \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6.4 \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted average discount rate \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nMaturities of the operating lease liabilities by fiscal year at December 31, 2022 for the Company's operating leases are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n51.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n50.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n43.3 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n32.7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n25.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nThereafter \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n61.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal undiscounted lease payments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n265.8 \n\n&#160; \n\nLess: Imputed interest \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n24.9 \n\n&#160; \n\nPresent value of future lease payments \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n240.9 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSupplemental cash flow information for operating leases: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (in millions) \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 \n\n&#160; \n\nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating cash flows from operating leases \n\n$ \n\n58.2 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n56.0 \n\n&#160; \n\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating liabilities \n\n$ \n\n71.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n54.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTE 16 Segme nt Information \n\nBrown &#38; Brown&#8217;s business is divided into four reportable segments: (i) the Retail segment, which provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public entities, and to professional and individual customers, and non-insurance risk-mitigating products through our F&#38;I businesses, (ii) the National Programs segment, which acts as an MGA, provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents, and Brown &#38; Brown retail agents, (iii) the Wholesale Brokerage segment, which markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, as well as Brown &#38; Brown retail agents, and (iv) the Services segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers&#8217; compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services and claims adjusting services. \n\nBrown &#38; Brown conducts most of its operations within the United States of America. International operations include Retail operations in England, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Northern Ireland, National Programs operations in Canada and England, and Wholesale Brokerage operations based in England, Italy and Belgium.

The Company also participates in two Captives for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity and participating in a portion of the underwriting results. One Captive participates on a quota share basis for policies placed by certain of our MGA businesses that are currently focused on property insurance for earthquake and wind exposed properties with a portion of premiums ceded to reinsurance companies, limiting, but not fully eliminating the Company's exposure to claims expenses. The other Captive participates through excess of loss reinsurance layers associated with one of our MGA businesses focused on placements of personal property, excluding flood, primarily in the southeastern United States with one layer of per risk excess reinsurance and three layers of catastrophe per occurrence reinsurance. All four layers have limited reinstatements and therefore have capped, maximum aggregate limits.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company ceded $ 738.0 million and $ 745.0 million of written premiums for Federal Flood, respectively. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheets contained Reinsurance recoverable of $ 826.2 million and Prepaid reinsurance premiums of $ 381.8 million . As of December 31, 2021, the Consolidated Balance Sheets contained reinsurance recoverable of $ 63.1 million and prepaid reinsurance premiums of $ 392.2 million . There was no net activity in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as WNFIC&#8217;s direct premiums written were 100.0 % ceded to two reinsurers. The balance of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense, excluding related reinsurance recoverable, was $ 826.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 63.1 million as of December 31, 2021. \n\nWNFIC maintains capital in excess of minimum statutory amount of $ 7.5 million as required by regulatory authorities. The statutory capital and surplus of WNFIC was $ 31.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 33.1 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, WNFIC generated statutory net income of $ 1.3 million and $ 1.6 million , respectively. The maximum amount of ordinary dividends that WNFIC can pay to shareholders in a rolling 12 month period is limited to the greater of 10.0 % of statutory adjusted capital and surplus of 100.0 % of adjusted net income. There was no dividend payout in 2021 and 2022 and the maximum dividend payout that may be made in 2023 without prior approval is $ 3.2 million . \n\nIn December 2021, the initial funding to capitalize the quota share Captive was $ 5.9 million. This capital in addition to current earnings of $ 4.0 million through December 31, 2022 is considered at risk for loss. Assumed net written and net earned premiums for the quota share Captive for 2022 were $ 38.3 million and $ 20.6 million, respectively. F or 2022, the ultimate loss expense inclusive of incurred but not reported (&#34;IBNR&#34;) claims was $ 10.4 million, of which $ 9.7 million is related to the estimated insured claims/losses from Hurricane Ian. In connection with the estimated IBNR from Hurricane Ian claims, $ 4.8 million was recorded as estimated reinsurance recoverable for a net expected loss of $ 4.9 million. As of December 31, 2022 the Consolidated Balance Sheets contained prepaid reinsurance premiums of $ 11.4 million, deferred acquisitions costs of $ 14.1 million, reinsurance payable for $ 8.7 million, and the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense, excluding related reinsurance recoverable, w as $ 10.4 million. The first collateral release is expected in 2024 and is based on an IBNR factor times earned premium compared to the current collateral balance. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe excess of loss layer Captive was renewed in September 2022 with underlying reinsurance treaties effective from June 1 through May 31, 2023. This Captive&#8217;s maximum underwriting exposure is $ 5.2 million. Assumed net earned premiums for the captive for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $ 5.8 million. During 2022, the captive recorded a case reserve of $ 7.0 million associated with estimated impacts from Hurricane Ian plus a reserve of $ 0.1 million for non-CAT claims. These reserves were partially offset by accelerated earned premiums of $ 2.8 million upon reaching the maximum aggregate loss for one of our reinsurance layers. The combination of earned premium of $ 2.4 million plus the accelerated earned premium of $ 2.8 million resulted in a underwriting loss of $ 1.9 million for year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Balance Sheets contained the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense of $ 4.5 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nNOTE 18 Shareh olders&#8217; Equity \n\nUnder the authorization from the Company&#8217;s board of directors, shares may be purchased from time to time, at the Company&#8217;s discretion and subject to the availability of stock, market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, the Company&#8217;s financial performance and other potential factors.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \n\n&#160; \n\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nEarn-out obligation &#8212; Refer to Notes 1 (Goodwill and Amortizable Intangible Assets) and 3 (Business Combinations) to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company&#8217;s acquisition purchase price for business combinations includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with potential earn-out provisions, when an earn-out obligation is part of the negotiated transaction. The fair value of the earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. The earn-out obligations are typically based upon a multiple of average annual operating profit and/or revenue earned over a one to three-year period within a minimum and maximum range. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the earn-out obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred. \n\nIn determining fair value of the earn-out obligation, the acquired business&#8217;s future performance is estimated using financial projections of future earnings developed by management that are discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earn-out obligation will be paid. The earn-out obligation balance was $251.6 million as of December 31, 2022 of which $119.3 million is recorded in accounts payable and $132.3 million is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. \n\nWe identified the earn-out obligation as a critical audit matter because of the increased auditor judgment and extent of effort required to evaluate whether an adjustment is required for the earn-out obligation in periods after the acquisition. Specifically, there was a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to audit the reasonableness of management&#8217;s assumptions related to projections of future earnings of the acquired businesses. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasted future earnings assumptions used in determining the fair value of the earn-out obligation included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s earn-out obligation calculation, including the controls over management&#8217;s determination of future earnings. \n\n&#8226; We read the asset/stock purchase agreements and associated addenda and agreed the provisions of the contracts to the earn-out obligation models for our testing selections. \n\n&#8226; We read any post-acquisition asset/stock purchase agreements and associated addenda modifications for any additional terms to evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of the models utilized to calculate the earn-out obligation for our testing selections. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated the reasonableness of projections of future earnings for the earn-out obligation models by comparing the projections to historical results and assessing management&#8217;s key assumptions for our testing selections. \n\n&#8226; We evaluated management&#8217;s ability to accurately forecast future earnings by comparing actual results to management&#8217;s historical forecast and forecasted growth rates to that of comparable subsidiaries for our testing selections. \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nTampa, Florida February 27, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. \n\n&#160; \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Brown &#38; Brown, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Brown &#38; Brown, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Orchid Underwriters Agency, LLC, GRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited et al., First Insurance Solutions Ltd., BdB Holdings Limited, Smithwick &#38; Mariners Insurance, Inc., VistaNational Insurance Group, Inc., and Taylor Berry Knight Limited, which were acquired during 2022 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 0.2% and 7.1% of net and total assets, respectively, 5.97% of revenues, and 0.85% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of these acquired entities. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n&#160; \n\n/s/ Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP \n\nTampa, Florida February 27, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThe management of Brown &#38; Brown, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Brown &#38; Brown&#8221;) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including Brown &#38; Brown&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Brown &#38; Brown conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;). \n\nIn conducting Brown &#38; Brown&#8217;s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, Brown &#38; Brown has excluded the following acquisitions completed by Brown &#38; Brown during 2022: Orchid Underwriters Agency, L LC , GRP (Jersey) Holdco Limited et al., First Insurance Solutions Ltd., BdB Holdings Limited, Smithwick &#38; Mariners Insurance, Inc., VistaNational Insurance Group, Inc., Taylor Berry Knight Limited, and Claim Technologies, Inc. (collectively the &#8220;2022 Excluded Acquisitions&#8221;), which were acquired during 2022 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 0.2% and 7.1% of net and total assets, respectively, 5.97% of revenues, and 0.85% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on Brown &#38; Brown&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nBased upon Brown &#38; Brown&#8217;s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission , management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Management&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. \n\nBrown &#38; Brown, Inc. \n\nDaytona Beach, Florida \n\nFebruary 27, 2023 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n/s/ J.

Controls and Procedures. \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nWe carried out an evaluation (the &#8220;Evaluation&#8221;) required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and chief financial officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act (&#8220;Disclosure Controls&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022. Based upon the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. \n\nChanges in Internal Controls \n\nThere has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nInherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. \n\nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. \n\nCEO and CFO Certifications \n\nExhibits 31.1 and 31.2 are the Certifications of the CEO and the CFO, respectively. The Certifications are supplied in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Section 302 Certifications&#8221;). This Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. \n\n"
