      "text": " ITEM 1. &#160; Business \n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements \n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to our 2023 outlook and all underlying assumptions, our proposal to acquire Life Storage, Inc. (&#8220;Life Storage&#8221;), our expected acquisition, disposition, development, and redevelopment activity, supply and demand for our self-storage facilities, information relating to operating trends in our markets, expectations regarding operating expenses, including property tax changes, expectations regarding the impacts from inflation and a potential future recession, our strategic priorities, expectations with respect to financing activities, rental rates, cap rates, and yields, leasing expectations, our credit ratings, and all other statements other than statements of historical fact. Such statements are based on management&#8217;s beliefs and assumptions made based on information currently available to management and may be identified by the use of the words &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; and similar expressions. \n\nThese forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may impact future results and performance include, but are not limited to, those described in Part 1, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). These include changes in demand for our facilities, impacts of natural disasters, adverse changes in laws and regulations including governing property tax, evictions, rental rates, minimum wage levels, and insurance, our ability to consummate acquisition transactions, including our proposed acquisition of Life Storage, and to realize the intended benefits of such transactions, adverse economic effects from the COVID-19 Pandemic, international military conflicts, or similar events impacting public health and/or economic activity, increases in the costs of our primary customer acquisition channels, adverse impacts to us and our customers from inflation, unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations, changes in federal or state tax laws related to the taxation of REITs, security breaches, including ransomware, or a failure of our networks, systems, or technology. \n\nThese forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. All of our forward-looking statements, including those in this report, are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, new estimates, or other factors, events, or circumstances after the date of these forward looking statements, except when expressly required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, neither as predictions of future events nor guarantees of future performance. \n\nGeneral Discussion of our Business \n\nPublic Storage (referred to herein as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), a Maryland real estate investment trust that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;), was organized in 1980. Our principal business activities include the ownership, development, and operation of self-storage facilities and other related operations including tenant reinsurance and third-party self-storage management. We are the industry leading owner and operator of self-storage properties, with the most recognized brand in the self-storage industry, including our ubiquitous orange color. \n\nSelf-storage Operations : \n\nWe acquire, develop, own, and operate self-storage facilities, which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), with physical presence in most major markets and 40 states. We believe our scale, brand name, and technology platform afford us competitive advantages. At December 31, 2022, we held interests in and consolidated 2,869 self-storage facilities (an aggregate of 204 million net rentable square feet of space) operating under the Public Storage&#174; name. \n\nOther Operations: \n\nWe manage insurance programs whereby customers at our facilities, including those we manage for third parties, have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their stored goods. A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of Public Storage fully reinsures these policies and thereby assumes all risk of losses under the policies. This subsidiary receives from the non-affiliated insurance company reinsurance premiums substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants. These policies cover claims for losses related to specified events up to a maximum limit of $5,000 per storage unit. We reinsure all risks in this program but purchase insurance from an independent third party insurer to cover this exposure for a limit of $15.0 million for losses in excess of $5.0 million per occurrence. At December 31, 2022, there were approximately 1.2 million certificates of insurance held by our self-storage customers, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $5.6 billion. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we managed 114 facilities for third parties, and were under contract to manage 78 additional facilities including 73 facilities that are currently under construction. In addition, we sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes at our self-storage facilities. \n\nWe hold a 35% interest in Shurgard Self Storage Limited (&#8220;Shurgard&#8221;). Shurgard is a public company traded on Euronext Brussels under the &#8220;SHUR&#8221; symbol. At December 31, 2022, Shurgard owned and operated 266 self-storage facilities (15 million net rentable square feet) located in seven countries in Western Europe under the Shurgard&#174; name. We previously held a significant equity interest in PS Business Parks, Inc. (&#8220;PSB&#8221;), which we sold in July 2022 in connection with PSB&#8217;s merger with an unaffiliated third party. \n\nFor all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we met these requirements in all periods presented herein and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. \n\nWe file annually with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, which include consolidated financial statements certified by our independent registered public accountants. We also file quarterly with the SEC quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which include unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue such reporting. \n\nOn our website, www.publicstorage.com, we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, definitive proxy statements, and other reports required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC, as well as all supplements and amendments to those filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after the filings, supplements, and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCompetition \n\nOwnership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 9% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 20%, with the remaining 80% owned by regional and local operators. We believe our Public Storage&#174; brand awareness, as well as our digital customer experience described below, provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring and retaining customers relative to other self-storage operators. \n\nThe high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators, who use marketing channels, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners, and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income, and operating expenses of our facilities. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale. \n\nTechnology \n\nWe believe technology enables revenue optimization and cost efficiencies. Over the past few years we have invested in additional technologies that we believe have enabled us to operate and compete more effectively by providing customers with an enhanced digital experience. \n\nConvenient shopping experience: Customers can conveniently shop for available storage space, reviewing attributes such as facility location, size, amenities (such as climate-control), and pricing through the following marketing channels: \n\n&#8226; Our Website: The online marketing channel is a key source of customers. Approximately 79% of our move-ins in 2022 were sourced through our website and we believe that many of our other customers who reserved directly through our customer care center or arrived at a facility and moved in without a reservation, have reviewed our pricing and availability online through our website. We seek to update the structure, layout, and content of our website regularly in order to enhance our placement in &#8220;unpaid&#8221; search in Google and related websites, to improve the efficiency of our bids in &#8220;paid&#8221; search campaigns, and to maximize users&#8217; likelihood of reserving space on our website. \n\n&#8226; Our Customer Care Center: Our customer care center is staffed by skilled sales specialists and customer service representatives. Customers reach our customer care center by calling our advertised toll-free telephone numbers provided on search engines, from our website, the Public Storage App, or from our in-store kiosks. We believe giving customers the option to interact with a live agent, despite the higher marginal cost relative to a reservation made on our website, enhances our ability to close sales with potential customers and results in greater satisfaction. We also have live Internet chat capability as another channel for our customers to engage our agents, cost effectively improving customer responsiveness. \n\n&#8226; Our Properties: Customers can also shop for available space at any one of our facilities. Property managers access the same information that is available on our website and to our customer care center agents and can inform the customer of available space at that site or at our other nearby storage facilities. Property managers are trained to maximize the conversion of such &#8220;walk in&#8221; shoppers into customers. We are expanding the use of in-store kiosks to give customers the options of a full self-service experience or a two-way video assisted service via our existing customer care center. \n\neRental&#174; move-in process: To further enhance the move-in experience, we offer our eRental&#174; process whereby prospective tenants (including those who initially reserved a space) are able to execute their rental agreement from their smartphone or computer and then go directly to their space on the move-in date. More than half of customers utilized our eRental&#174; process during 2022. \n\nPublic Storage App: We maintain an industry leading customer smartphone application. The Public Storage App provides our customers with digital access to our properties, as well as payment and other account management functions. \n\nCentralized information network: Our centralized reporting and information network enables us to identify changing market conditions and operating trends and analyze customer data. Our network allows us to quickly change each of our individual property&#8217;s pricing and promotions, and drive marketing spending, such as the relative level of bidding for various paid search terms on paid search engines. \n\nGrowth and Investment Strategies \n\nOur ongoing growth strategies consist of: (i) improving the operating performance of our existing self-storage facilities, (ii) acquiring and developing facilities, and (iii) growing ancillary business activities including tenant reinsurance and third-party management services. While our long-term strategy includes each of these elements, in the short term the level of growth in our asset base in any period is dependent upon the cost and availability of capital, as well as the relative attractiveness of available investment alternatives. \n\nImprove the operating performance of existing facilities: We regularly update and enhance our strategies to increase the net cash flow of our existing self-storage facilities through maximizing revenues and controlling operating costs. We maximize revenues through striking the appropriate balance between occupancy and rates to new and existing \n\ntenants by regularly adjusting (i) our promotional and other discounts, (ii) the rental rates we charge to new and existing customers, and (iii) our marketing spending and intensity. We inform these pricing and marketing decisions by observing their impact on web and customer care center traffic, reservations, move-ins, move-outs, tenant length of stay, and other indicators of response. The size and scope of our operations have enabled us to achieve high operating margins and a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues through the centralization of many functions, such as facility maintenance, employee compensation and benefits programs, revenue management, and the development and documentation of standardized operating procedures. \n\nAcquire existing properties: We seek to capitalize on the fragmentation of the self-storage industry through acquiring attractively priced, well-located existing self-storage facilities. We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Data on the rental rates and occupancy levels of our existing facilities provide us an advantage in evaluating the potential of acquisition opportunities. Our aggressiveness in bidding for particular marketed facilities depends upon many factors including the potential for future growth, the quality of construction and location, the cash flow we expect from the facility when operated on our platform, how well the facility fits into our current geographic footprint, and our return on capital expectations. \n\nDevelop new self-storage facilities and expand existing facilities: The development of new self-storage locations and the expansion of existing facilities has been an important source of our growth. Our operating experience in major markets and experience in stabilizing new properties provides us advantages in developing new facilities. We plan to increase our development activity when we identify attractive risk adjusted return profiles with yields above those of acquisitions. However, our level of development is dependent upon many factors, including the cost and availability of land, the cost and availability of construction materials and labor, zoning and permitting limitations, our cost of capital, the cost of acquiring facilities relative to developing new facilities, and local demand and economic conditions. \n\nGrow ancillary business activities: We pursue growth initiatives aimed at increasing our insurance offering coverage for tenants who choose to protect their stored items against loss and desire to maximize their storage experience. As we grow our self-storage portfolio we have the opportunity to increase the growth profile of our tenant reinsurance business. \n\nOur third party management business enables us to generate revenues through management fees, expand our presence, increase our economies of scale, promote our brand, and enhance our ability to acquire additional facilities over the medium and long-term as a result of strategic relationships forged with third-party owners. \n\nCompliance with Government Regulations \n\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including various federal, state, and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of self-storage facilities. These include various laws and regulations concerning environmental matters, labor matters, and employee safety and health matters. Further, our insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with certain federal regulations. \n\nWe are committed to a long-term environmental stewardship program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment and the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns, including environmentally-friendly capital initiatives and building and operating properties with high structural resilience and low obsolescence. We accrue environmental assessments and estimated remediation costs when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. Our current practice is to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions. Although there can be no assurance, we are not aware of any environmental contamination of any of our facilities that individually or in the aggregate would be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\nRefer to Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below for a discussion of certain risks related to government regulations, including risks related to environmental regulations, emergency regulations adopted in response to wildfires, flooding, or public health crises that restrict access to our facilities or the rents we can charge our customers, wage regulations, income tax regulations including relating to REIT qualification, and property tax regulations. \n\nAside from the regulations discussed therein, we are not aware of any government regulations that have resulted or that we expect will result in compliance costs that had or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. \n\nHuman Capital Resources \n\nOur employees are the foundation of our business and fundamental to our ability to execute our corporate strategies and build long-term value for our stakeholders. In order to maintain a strong foundation, our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain the highest quality talent. We achieve these objectives by committing to our employees to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, regular and open communication, competitive and supportive compensation and benefits programs, and opportunities for career growth and development. Together with our core values of doing the right thing and integrity in all that we do, which serve as the cornerstone of our corporate culture, we believe that this commitment facilitates employee engagement and their commitment to Public Storage. \n\nWe have approximately 5,900 employees, including 5,090 customer facing roles (such as property level and customer care center personnel), 380 field management employees, and 430 employees in our corporate operations. \n\nThe following is an overview of our key programs and initiatives focused on attracting, developing, and retaining the highest quality talent: \n\nDiversity and Inclusion \n\nWe are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse workplace where all employees feel valued, included, and excited to be part of a best-in-class team. Our employees come from all different races, backgrounds, and life experiences, and we celebrate inclusion and value the diversity each person brings to Public Storage. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion makes us a stronger company and instills a sense of pride across our teams as we serve our customers. \n\nIn 2021, our Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action for Diversity &#38; Inclusion pledge, reflecting our commitment to foster an environment where everyone feels valued and included. This commitment extends not just throughout Public Storage but across the real estate industry. In this regard, in 2022, we made a founding donor contribution to the Nareit Dividends through Diversity, Equity &#38; Inclusion Giving Campaign, which is directed at taking actionable and sustainable measures that support the recruitment, inclusion, development, and advancement of women, black professionals, other people of color, ethnically diverse individuals, and members of other under-represented groups in REITs and the publicly traded real estate industry. \n\nPublic Storage hires based on skills, personality, and experience, without regard to age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic. We maintain policies regarding diversity, equal opportunity, pay-for-performance, discrimination, harassment, and labor (including opposition to child, forced, and compulsory labor). We also maintain a policy of requiring that diverse candidate slates be considered for all director positions and above. \n\nAdherence to our practice of hiring &#8220;the best&#8221; has fostered a diverse and inclusive employee base that reflects the diversity of the customers we serve. Our commitment to diversity is evident at all levels of the organization. Additionally, by having a balanced mix of generations in the organization, we gain from the experiences each age group brings &#8211; our employees are 9% Boomer, 38% Gen X, 36% Gen Y and 17% Gen Z. \n\nWe publicly disclose our annual Consolidated EEO-1 report, which reflects the race, ethnicity, and gender composition of our workforce, on the Investor Relations section of our website. \n\nCommunication and Engagement \n\nGiven the geographically dispersed nature of our business, regular and clear communication is critical to ensuring that employees feel informed, included, and engaged. We communicate through various channels, including email communications, a monthly newsletter and town halls, where we provide employees company strategy and performance updates, employee recognitions and other information and the opportunity to ask questions of our leaders. \n\nIn order to better understand the effectiveness of our engagement strategies, we conduct various surveys that measure employee commitment, motivation, and engagement, and solicit employee feedback that helps us improve. In 2022, 85% of our employees participated in our employee engagement survey, an increase from 80% in 2021, and we achieved employee engagement of 76%. We are committed to continuous listening and improvement for our employees, and our feedback tools have guided enhancements for our employees, including the development of additional career progression opportunities and enhancements to our employee compensation and benefits programs. \n\nWe believe that the success of our engagement strategies can also be seen through third party surveys and recognition. Among other recognitions, we are proud to be named in 2022 a Great Place to Work&#174; and included on the 2022 Forbes and Statista &#8220;America&#8217;s Best Large Employers&#8221; award list. We have also been recognized by Comparably, Inc. as a &#8220;Choice Employer&#8221; with an &#8220;A+&#8221; Culture Score based on employee responses across 18 culture metrics, among other recognitions. \n\nCompensation, Health, Wellness, and Safety \n\nPublic Storage maintains compensation and benefits programs designed to incentivize, reward, and support our employees. We believe in aligning employee compensation with our short- and long-term performance goals and providing the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate, and retain employees who are crucial to our success. We tailor our compensation programs to each employee group to ensure competitiveness in the market and to drive employee engagement. \n\nWe are committed to the total well-being of all our employees and provide resources to help support them in times of need along with access to targeted solutions to help them achieve their personal and financial goals. We provide affordable health plans and programs to virtually all our employees. Anyone working 20 hours or more is eligible to participate in our health benefit offerings, which include medical, dental, vision, flexible and health savings accounts, discount programs, and income protection plans. We also offer a 401(k) plan with generous matching employer contributions to help our employees prepare for retirement. In addition to these programs, we maintain various employee support programs, including access to counseling, life planning tools, and discount programs for fitness, legal services, and home, auto, and pet insurance. Finally, we offer a range of educational tools and resources, including a dedicated health and wellness website, to help empower our employees to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. \n\nWe are committed to providing safe self-storage facilities for our customers and employees. We conduct monthly safety trainings at all of our properties and an annual safety training at our headquarters. We did not have any fatal injuries in 2022 and we publicly disclose our employee health and safety data in our annual Sustainability Report. \n\nTraining, Development, Growth, and Recognition \n\nWe provide robust training and development programs across all levels of Public Storage that are intended to provide our employees with the skills, tools, and knowledge they need to not only grow as individuals but also contribute to the value of the organization through strong engagement. \n\nMost new hires join us as property managers without any experience in the self-storage industry. We provide a hands-on new hire training program that provides close coaching and development. All new hires in leadership roles complete property-level training that gives them a hands-on view of our day-to-day operations at our properties to provide our leaders with an understanding of the fundamentals of our business and operations. We also provide numerous career development opportunities for existing employees across Public Storage, including management training programs. Many of our training and career development programs leverage our online learning platform of training courses and reference materials. Public Storage employees completed over 430,000 formal training hours in 2022. In addition to formal training programs, we also offer a variety of one-on-one coaching, job shadowing, and mentoring programs. \n\nPerformance Management and Succession Planning \n\nOur performance management processes are designed to be collaborative, where employees and management work together to plan, monitor, and review the employee&#8217;s objectives and career aspirations and set short- and long-term goals to achieve outcomes. This process is continual, with regular opportunities for management and employees to give and receive feedback. \n\nSuccession planning is a top priority for management and our Board of Trustees (our &#8220;Board&#8221;) to ensure business continuity. Leaders at all levels review development opportunities, provide feedback, and facilitate career progression conversations on an ongoing basis to ensure that employees can reach their full potential. Additionally, in 2022, we began development of a new leadership accelerator program for women and diverse employees, which includes individual mentorship and hands-on experiences directed at further enhancing our bench of women and minority leaders and management succession planning. \n\nNo less than annually, the executive teams meet to review succession bench strength, calibrate talent, and provide recommendations to prepare succession candidates for future leadership roles within the organization. This broad and collaborative approach to talent management works to ensure opportunities are made available to employees to grow outside of their current function and responsibilities. \n\nClimate Change and Environmental Stewardship \n\nWe are committed to managing climate-related risks and opportunities. This commitment is a key component of our recognition that we must operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that aligns with our long-term corporate strategy and promotes our best interests along with those of our stakeholders, including our customers, investors, employees, and the communities in which we do business. \n\nOur management Environmental, Social, and Governance Steering Committee (our &#8220;Sustainability Committee&#8221;) guides our commitment to sustainability and has primary responsibility for climate-related activities. The Sustainability Committee reports to our Board and its Committees, which oversee all of our sustainability initiatives. \n\nWe consider potential environmental impacts&#8212;both positive and negative&#8212;in our decision making across the business. The following features of our properties reflect our commitment to responsible environmental stewardship: \n\n- Low environmental impact. Our property portfolio has an inherently light footprint. On average, one to two Public Storage employees operate each property at any given time, and our customers are only occasionally on-site because they do not work or reside there. As a result, our properties consume less energy, emit less carbon, use less water, and produce less waste relative to other real estate types. \n\n- Proactive Initiatives. Despite our light environmental footprint, we proactively strive to reduce our impact further through initiatives such as &#8220;on demand&#8221; LED lighting, solar power generation, and low-water-use landscaping. These are environmentally friendly initiatives that also generate economic returns on invested capital. Additionally, we have recently partnered with The BRE Group to develop a green building certification program for self-storage facilities in the U.S. through its BREEAM&#174; validation and certification system. \n\n- Low obsolescence . Our properties have retained functional and physical usefulness over many decades. In fact, many customers favor our single-story, drive-up properties built in the 1970s and 1980s due to their central locations and accessibility. This contrasts with other real estate types that require frequent reinvestment (i.e., capital expenditures) to stay current with consumer preference, remain competitive with newer competition, offset heavier wear-and-tear by users, and maintain structural operating efficiency. \n\n- High structural resilience. We build and operate our properties to withstand the test of time, including general aging and acute and chronic risks from rising water levels, changing temperatures, and natural disasters. \n\nWe measure and monitor our environmental impact and leverage sustainability measures to reduce this impact while achieving cost efficiencies in our operations by implementing a range of energy, water, and waste management initiatives. Many of these initiatives are integrated into our ongoing Property of Tomorrow capital investment program. \n\nIn regard to climate, we assess risks and opportunities in conjunction with ongoing operating and risk management processes across the company. We give primary consideration to physical, regulatory, legal, market, and \n\nreputational risks. Examples of these risks include heat/water stress, natural disasters, pandemics, temperature change, and regulatory compliance. We are addressing potential heat stress risks (e.g., higher energy costs, more frequent power outages, and impacts on our customers and workforce) through initiatives such as converting to LED lighting, solar power generation installation, and analyzing battery storage and microgrids. We are addressing potential water stress risks (e.g., increased costs and decreased availability) through initiatives such as efficient plumbing systems, low-water use irrigation systems, drought tolerant and native landscaping, water run-off controls, and storm water retention. We address the remaining risks primarily through natural disaster resilient development, redevelopment, and capital expenditures. \n\nWe will continue to utilize our unique competitive advantages in furthering our environmental stewardship efforts and addressing the effects of climate change. Our commitment includes: \n\n&#8226; expanding our greenhouse gas emissions inventory to include Scopes 1, 2, and 3 for the entire portfolio; \n\n&#8226; analyzing opportunities to work with our vendors and suppliers on emissions; \n\n&#8226; enhancing our internal processes and controls in anticipation of forthcoming SEC climate disclosure rules; \n\n&#8226; evaluating the feasibility of instituting well-founded medium and/or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets or other science-based, climate-focused targets in a manner aligned with the ambitious carbon reduction goals of the Paris Climate Agreement; \n\n&#8226; continuing to enhance our environmental management system to further infuse sustainability across our organization, enhance our program, and bolster the results of our sustainability efforts; \n\n&#8226; continuing to provide regular updates to our stakeholders on our ongoing efforts through our annual Sustainability Report; and \n\n&#8226; continuing publicly to disclose detailed information on our greenhouse gas emissions (consistent with TCFD standards), including through the Carbon Disclosure Project, as well as information on energy and water usage, green energy generation, and similar metrics. \n\nOur annual Sustainability Report, which details our commitment to environmental stewardship along with our results, performance and progress, is accessible on our website at www.publicstorage.com. \n\nCybersecurity \n\nPublic Storage devotes significant resources to protecting and continuing to improve the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets. Our security efforts are designed to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of all information owned by, or in the care of, the Company and protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. \n\nBoard Oversight \n\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk one of the most significant risks to our business. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks affecting the Company. The Audit Committee periodically evaluates our cybersecurity strategy to ensure its effectiveness. Management provides quarterly reports to the Audit Committee regarding cybersecurity and other information technology risks, and the Audit Committee in turn provides reports to the full Board. \n\nAs part of our Board refreshment efforts in recent years, we have focused on adding trustees with information technology skills. Currently, ten members of our Board, including all four members of our Audit Committee, have cybersecurity experience from their principal occupation or other professional experience. In addition, several members of our Audit Committee have attended third-party director education courses on cybersecurity since 2021, including cyber risk governance, and privacy issues and trends. \n\nCybersecurity Risk Identification and Management \n\nA dedicated team of technology professionals works throughout the year to monitor all matters of risk relating to cybersecurity. Our Chief Technology Officer and our Vice President, Management Information Systems, oversee our information security program and report to our executive management team through our Chief Administrative Officer. Their teams are responsible for leading enterprise-wide cyber resilience strategy, policy, standards, architecture, and processes. \n\nWe identify and address information security risks by employing a defense-in-depth methodology, consisting of both proactive and reactive elements, that provides multiple, redundant defensive measures and prescribes actions to take in case a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited. We leverage internal resources, along with strategic external partnerships, to mitigate cybersecurity threats to the Company. We have partnerships for Security Operations Center (SOC) services, penetration testing (PENTEST), incident response (IR), and various third-party assessments. We deploy both commercially available solutions and proprietary systems to manage threats to our information technology environment actively. \n\nOur cybersecurity oversight infrastructure is part of our internal control environment and our controls include information security standards. In addition, we are certified against top information security standards, specifically the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), to ensure we comply with this rigorous standard specifically for the safe handling and protection of credit card data. Annually, we are assessed, either internally or by an independent third-party, against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework. We also have policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including the regular review of SOC reports, relevant cyber attestations, and other independent cyber ratings. These processes include technical controls and processes, as well as contractual mechanisms to mitigate risk. Additionally, throughout the year, we utilize reports prepared by our external partners, which provide an independent ranking of our cybersecurity maturity and coverage, to assess our cyber proficiency on an standalone basis and comparatively against peers and other companies. Our cyber proficiency consistently ranks as &#8220;advanced.&#8221; We also regularly engage appropriate external resources regarding emerging threats to navigate the diverse cybersecurity landscape. \n\nIn addition to ensuring adequate safeguards are in place to minimize the chance of a successful cyberattack, the Company has established well-defined response procedures to address any cyber event that may occur despite these robust safeguards. These response procedures are designed to identify, analyze, contain, and remediate such cyber incidents to ensure a timely, consistent, and compliant response to actual or attempted data incidents impacting the Company. Recently, the Company completed two separate Disaster Response and Business Continuity Plan exercises to validate our current readiness, and the Company devotes appropriate resources and enlists partners to adapt to the evolving threat landscape. Each year, the Company tests these response procedures, including through disaster response and business continuity plan exercises, in our continuous effort to adapt to the evolving threat landscape. These exercises are intended to challenge and validate our information security response and resources through simulated cybersecurity incidents, including engagement of outside cybersecurity legal counsel, other third party partners, executive management, and our Board. \n\nThe Company takes data protection seriously and ensures every employee understands their role in keeping Public Storage safe from cyber-attacks. We employ a robust information security and training program for our employees, including mandatory computer-based training, regular internal communications, and ongoing end-user testing to measure the effectiveness of our information security program. As part of this commitment, we require our employees to complete a Cybersecurity Awareness eCourse and acknowledge our Information Security policy each year. In addition, we have an established schedule and process for regular phishing awareness campaigns that are designed to emulate real-world contemporary threats and provide immediate feedback (and, if necessary, additional training or remedial action) to employees. \n\nWe have experienced no material information security breaches in the last three years. As such, we have not spent any material amount of capital on addressing information security breaches in the last three years, nor have we incurred any material expenses from penalties and settlements related to a material breach during this same time. \n\nWe believe we are adequately insured against losses related to a potential information security breach, and we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for the size and complexity of our business. \n\nSeasonality \n\nWe experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the demand for self-storage space, with demand and rental rates generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months. We believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer months. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors \n\nIn addition to the other information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the risks described below that we believe may be material to investors in evaluating the Company. This section contains forward-looking statements, and in considering these statements, you should refer to the qualifications and limitations on our forward-looking statements that are described in Item 1, &#8220;Business.&#8221; \n\nRisks Related to Our Properties and Our Business \n\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, or other events that could damage or otherwise disrupt our ability to operate our facilities could adversely impact our business and financial results. \n\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and floods, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, and other events that damage our facilities or our customers' property, or that make our facilities temporarily unavailable, have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business and financial results. Damage and business interruption losses could exceed the aggregate limits of our insurance coverage. In addition, because we self-insure a portion of our risks, losses below a certain level may not be covered by insurance. See Note 14 to our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements for a description of the risks of losses that are not covered by third-party insurance contracts. In addition, customer perceptions about the risk of property loss from these events could negatively impact self-storage demand. \n\nWe are subject to risks from the consequences of climate change, including severe weather events, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy and other steps taken to prevent or mitigate climate change. \n\nOur self-storage facilities are located in areas that may be subject to the direct impacts of climate change, such as increased destructive weather events like floods, fires, and drought, which could result in significant damage to our facilities, increased capital expenditures, increased expenses, reduced revenues, or reduced demand for our facilities. Indirect impacts of climate change could also adversely impact our business, including through increased costs, such as insurance costs or regulatory compliance costs. In addition, the ongoing transition to a low-carbon economy presents certain risks for us and our customers, including stranded assets, increased costs, lower profitability, lower property values, lower household wealth, and macroeconomic risks related to high energy costs and energy shortages, among other things. Consistent with our commitment to sustainability in our business operations, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce emissions and energy consumption, water usage, and waste, including through our Property of Tomorrow program, pursuant to which we are upgrading all of our older properties by the end of 2025, which has already resulted in investment of approximately $370 million in improvements through December 31, 2022. In addition, we have made investments in LED lighting and the installation of solar panels of approximately $100 million since 2021 through December 31, 2022. Governmental, political, and societal pressures, including expectations of institutional and activist investors and other interest groups, could require us to accelerate our initiatives and, with it, the costs of their implementation. These same potential governmental, political, and social pressure could in the future result in (i) costly changes to newly developed facilities or retrofits of our existing facilities to reduce carbon emissions through multiple avenues, including changes to insulation, space configuration, lighting, heating, and air conditioning, (ii) increased energy costs as a result of transitioning to less carbon-intensive, but more expensive, sources of energy to operate our facilities, and (iii) consumers reducing their individual carbon footprints by owning fewer durable material consumer goods, collectibles, and other such items requiring storage, resulting in a reduced demand for our self-storage space. In addition, our reputation and investor relationships could be damaged as a result of our involvement with activities perceived to be causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. \n\nOperating costs, including property taxes, could increase. \n\nWe could be subject to increases in property or other taxes, repair and maintenance costs, payroll, utility costs, insurance premiums, workers compensation, and other operating expenses due to various factors such as inflation, labor shortages, commodity and energy price increases, weather, increases to minimum wage rates, supply chain disruptions, and \n\nchanges to governmental safety and real estate use limitations and other governmental actions. Our property tax expense, which totaled approximately $386.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, generally depends upon the assessed value of our real estate facilities as determined by assessors and government agencies and, accordingly, could be subject to substantial increases if such agencies change their valuation approaches or opinions or if new laws are enacted, especially if new approaches are adopted or laws are enacted that result in increased property tax assessments in states or geographies where we have a high concentration of facilities. See also &#8220;We have exposure to increased property tax in California&#8221; below. \n\nThe acquisition of existing properties or self-storage operating companies is subject to risks that may adversely affect our growth and financial results. \n\nWe have acquired self-storage facilities and self-storage operating companies in the past, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We face significant competition for suitable acquisition properties and companies from other real estate investors, including operating companies and private equity funds. As a result, we may be unable to acquire the companies or additional properties we desire or the purchase price for desirable companies or properties may be significantly increased. Failures or unexpected circumstances in integrating facilities or companies that we acquire, or circumstances we did not detect or anticipate during due diligence, such as environmental matters, needed repairs or deferred maintenance, customer collection issues, assumed liabilities, turnover of critical personnel involved in acquired operating companies, or the effects of increased property tax following reassessment of a newly-acquired property, as well as the general risks of real estate investment and mergers and acquisitions, could jeopardize realization of the anticipated earnings from an acquisition. \n\nOn February 5, 2023, we disclosed that we have made a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of Life Storage for consideration consisting of our common shares. Our public offer followed prior rebuffs by Life Storage of our attempts to negotiate privately, and on February 16, 2023, Life Storage announced it had rejected the offer. While we currently intend to engage in discussions with Life Storage, there can be no assurance that Life Storage will engage with us regarding our proposal or that we and Life Storage will agree to an acquisition transaction. Additionally, Life Storage can avail itself of various takeover defenses, including the ability unilaterally to classify its board of trustees under the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act (MUTA). Even if we reach an agreement with Life Storage, there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing such transaction would be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Further, if a transaction is consummated, there can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits we hope to achieve through the transaction, and the complexities of combining the two companies may result in unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses. If a transaction is not consummated, we nevertheless may incur significant costs associated with our pursuit of the transaction. \n\nOur development program subjects us to risks. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had a pipeline of development projects totaling $979.6 million (subject to contingencies), and we expect to continue to seek additional development projects. There are significant risks involved in developing self-storage facilities, such as delays or cost increases due to changes in or failure to meet government or regulatory requirements, failure of revenue to meet our underwriting estimates, delays caused by weather issues, unforeseen site conditions, or personnel problems. Self-storage space is generally not pre-leased, and rent-up of newly developed space can be delayed or ongoing cash flow yields can be reduced due to competition, reductions in storage demand, or other factors. \n\nThere is significant competition among self-storage operators and from other storage alternatives. \n\nOur self-storage facilities generate most of our revenue and earnings. Significant competition from self-storage operators, property developers, and other storage alternatives may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. Competition in the local market areas in which many of our properties are located is significant and affects our occupancy levels, rental rates, and operating expenses. There is also an increasing influx of capital from outside financing sources driving more money, development, and supply into the industry. Development of self-storage facilities may increase, which may intensify competition as newly developed facilities are opened. Development of self-storage facilities by other operators could increase, due to increases in availability of funds for investment or other reasons, and further intensify competition. \n\nDemand for self-storage facilities may be affected by customer perceptions and factors outside of our control. \n\nSignificantly lower logistics costs could introduce new competitors, such as valet-style storage services, which may reduce the demand for traditional self-storage. Customer preferences and/or needs for self-storage could change, decline, or shift to other product types, thereby impacting our business model and ability to grow and/or generate revenues. Shifts in population and demographics could cause the geographical distribution of our portfolio to be suboptimal and affect our ability to maintain occupancy and attract new customers. Security incidents could result in the perception that our properties are not safe. If our customers do not feel our properties are safe, they may select competitors for their self-storage needs, or if there is an industry perception of inadequate security generally, customer use of self-storage could be negatively impacted. \n\nOur newly developed and expanded facilities, and facilities that we manage for third party owners, may negatively impact the revenues of our existing facilities. \n\nWe continue to develop new self-storage facilities and expand our existing self-storage facilities. In addition, we are seeking to increase the number of self-storage facilities that we manage for third party owners in exchange for a fee, many of which are in the process of stabilization and are near our existing stabilized self-storage facilities. In order to hasten the fill-up of these new facilities, we aggressively price such space during the fill-up period. While we believe that this aggressive pricing allows us to increase our market share relative to our competitors and increase the cash flows of these properties, such pricing and the added capacity may also negatively impact our existing stabilized self-storage facilities that are near these unstabilized facilities. \n\nMany of our existing self-storage facilities may be at a competitive disadvantage to newly developed facilities. \n\nThere is a significant level of development of new self-storage facilities, by us and other operators. These newly developed facilities are generally of high quality, with a more fresh and vibrant appearance, more amenities (such as climate control), more attractive office configurations, newer elements, and a more attractive retail presence as compared to many of our existing stabilized self-storage facilities, some of which were built as much as 50 years ago. Such qualitative differentials may negatively impact our ability to compete with these facilities for new tenants and our existing tenants may move to newly developed facilities. \n\nWe may incur significant liabilities from environmental contamination or moisture infiltration. \n\nExisting or future laws impose or may impose liability on us to clean up environmental contamination on or around properties that we currently or previously owned or operated, even if we were not responsible for or aware of the environmental contamination or even if such environmental contamination occurred prior to our involvement with the property. We have conducted preliminary environmental assessments on most of our properties, which have not identified any material liabilities. These assessments, commonly referred to as &#8220;Phase 1 Environmental Assessments,&#8221; include an investigation (excluding soil or groundwater sampling or analysis) and a review of publicly available information regarding the site and other nearby properties. \n\nWe are also subject to potential liability relating to moisture infiltration, which can result in mold or other damage to our or our customers&#8217; property, as well as potential health concerns. When we receive a complaint or otherwise become aware that an air quality concern exists, we implement corrective measures and seek to work proactively with our customers to resolve issues, subject to our contractual limitations on liability for such claims. \n\nWe are not aware of any environmental contamination or moisture infiltration related liabilities at any of our properties that could be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operation. However, we may not have detected all material liabilities, we could acquire properties with material undetected liabilities, or new conditions could arise or develop at our properties, any of which could result in a cash settlement or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, operate, or encumber affected facilities. \n\nEconomic conditions can adversely affect our business, financial condition, growth, and access to capital. \n\nEconomic downturns or adverse economic or industry conditions, including those related to high levels of inflation, could adversely impact our financial results, growth, and access to capital. Our revenues and operating cash flow can be negatively impacted by reductions in employment and population levels, household and disposable income, and \n\nother general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for self-storage space in each of the markets in which we operate. \n\nOur ability to raise capital on attractive terms to fund our activities may be adversely affected by challenging market conditions, including high interest rates resulting from government efforts to manage inflation. In periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility, the amounts, sources, and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected. If we were unable to raise capital at reasonable rates, prospective earnings growth through expanding our asset base could be limited. \n\nWe have exposure to European operations through our ownership in Shurgard. \n\nWe own approximately 35% of the common shares of Shurgard, and this investment has a $275.8 million book value and a $1.4 billion market value (based upon the closing trading price of Shurgard&#8217;s common stock) at December 31, 2022. We recognized $26.4 million in equity in earnings and received $37.8 million in dividends in 2022 with respect to Shurgard. \n\nShurgard, as an owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, is subject to many of the same risks we are with respect to self-storage. However, through our investment in Shurgard, we are exposed to additional risks unique to the various European markets in which Shurgard operates, which may adversely impact our business and financial results, and many of which are referred to in Shurgard&#8217;s public filings. These risks include the following: \n\n&#8226; Currency risks: Currency fluctuations can impact the fair value of our investment in Shurgard, our equity earnings, our ongoing dividends, and any other related repatriations of cash. \n\n&#8226; Legislative, tax, and regulatory risks: Shurgard is subject to a variety of local, national, and pan-European laws and regulations related to permitting and land use, the environment, labor, and other areas, as well as income, property, sales, and value added and employment tax. These laws and regulations can be difficult to apply or interpret, can vary in each country or locality, and are subject to unexpected changes in their form and application due to regional, national, or local political uncertainty and other factors. Such changes, or Shurgard&#8217;s failure to comply with these laws, could subject it to penalties or other sanctions, adverse changes in business processes, and, potentially, adverse income tax, property tax, or other tax burdens. \n\n&#8226; Impediments to capital repatriation could negatively impact the realization of our investment in Shurgard: Laws in Europe and the U.S. may create, impede, or increase our cost to repatriate distributions received from Shurgard or proceeds from the sale of Shurgard shares. \n\n&#8226; Risks of collective bargaining: Collective bargaining, which is prevalent in certain areas in Europe, could negatively impact Shurgard&#8217;s labor costs or operations. Many of Shurgard&#8217;s employees participate in various national unions. \n\n&#8226; Potential operating and individual country risks: Economic slowdowns or extraordinary political or social change in the countries in which it operates have posed, and could continue to pose, challenges or result in future reductions of Shurgard&#8217;s operating cash flows. \n\n&#8226; Liquidity of our ownership stake: We have no plans to liquidate our interest in Shurgard. However, while Shurgard is a publicly held entity, if we chose to, our ability to liquidate our shares in Shurgard in an efficient manner could be limited by the level of Shurgard&#8217;s public &#8220;float&#8221; relative to any ownership stake we sought to sell. Our existing relationship with our legacy joint venture partner may place further contractual limitations on our ability to sell all of the shares we own if we desired to do so. \n\n&#8226; Impediments of Shurgard&#8217;s public ownership structure: Shurgard&#8217;s strategic decisions, involving activities such as borrowing money, capital contributions, raising capital from third parties, and selling or acquiring significant assets, are determined by its board of directors. As a result, Shurgard may be precluded from taking advantage of opportunities that we would find attractive but that we may not be able to pursue separately, or it could take actions that we do not agree with. \n\nPublic health and other crises, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic, have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. \n\nOur business is subject to risks from public health and other crises like the COVID-19 Pandemic, including, among others: \n\n&#8226; risk of illness or death of our employees or customers; \n\n&#8226; negative impacts on economic conditions in our markets, which may reduce the demand for self-storage; \n\n&#8226; risk that there could be an out-migration of population from certain high-cost major markets; \n\n&#8226; government restrictions that (i) limit or prevent use of our facilities, (ii) limit our ability to increase rent or otherwise limit the rent we can charge, (iii) limit our ability to collect rent or evict delinquent tenants, or (iv) limit our ability to complete development and redevelopment projects; \n\n&#8226; risk that we could experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty and increases in unemployment, which could lead to lower occupancies and rent &#8220;roll down&#8221; as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates; and \n\n&#8226; risk of negative impacts on the cost and availability of debt and equity capital, which could have a material impact upon our capital and growth plans. \n\nWe have been and may in the future be adversely impacted by emergency regulations adopted in response to significant events, such as natural disasters or public health crises, that could adversely impact our operations. \n\nIn response to significant events, local, state, and federal governments have and may in the future adopt regulations that could impact our operations. For example, in response to wildfires in 2018 and 2019 and floods in 2023, the State of California and some localities in California adopted temporary regulations that imposed certain limits on the rents we could charge at certain of our facilities and the extent to which we could increase rents to existing tenants. Similarly, in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, certain localities adopted restrictions on the use of certain of our facilities, limited our ability to increase rents, limited our ability to collect rent or evict delinquent tenants, and limited our ability to complete development and redevelopment projects. Similar restrictions could be imposed in the future in response to significant events and these restrictions could adversely impact our operations. \n\nOur marketing and pricing strategies may fail to be effective or may be constrained by factors outside of our control. \n\nMarketing initiatives, including our increasing dependence on Google to source customers, may fail to be effective and could negatively impact financial performance. Approximately 65% of our new storage customers in 2022 were sourced directly or indirectly through &#8220;unpaid&#8221; search and &#8220;paid&#8221; search campaigns on Google. We believe that the vast majority of customers searching for self-storage use Google at some stage in their shopping experience. Google is providing tools to allow smaller and less sophisticated operators to bid for search terms, increasing competition for self-storage search terms. The predominance of Google in the shopping experience, as well as Google&#8217;s enabling of additional competitors to bid for placements in self-storage search terms, may reduce the number of new customers that we can procure, and/or increase our costs to obtain new customers. \n\nIn addition, the inability to utilize our pricing methodology due to regulatory or market constraints could also significantly impact our financial results. \n\nWe are exposed to ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions, which may divert management&#8217;s time and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business. \n\nWe have approximately 5,900 employees and 1.8 million customers, and we conduct business at facilities in 40 states. As a result, we are subject to the risk of legal claims and proceedings (including class actions) and regulatory enforcement actions across many jurisdictions in the ordinary course of our business and otherwise, and we could incur significant liabilities and substantial legal fees as a result of these actions. Resolution of these claims and actions may divert time and attention by our management and could involve payment of damages or expenses by us, all of which may \n\nbe significant, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. We cannot guarantee that losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or any available insurance coverage. Any such legal claims, proceedings, and regulatory enforcement actions could negatively impact our operating results, cash flow available for distribution or reinvestment, and/or the price of our common shares. \n\nIn addition, through exercising their authority to regulate our activities, governmental agencies can otherwise negatively impact our business by increasing costs or decreasing revenues. \n\nOur failure to modernize and adopt advancements in information technology may hinder or prevent us from achieving strategic objectives. \n\nOur inability to adapt and deliver new capabilities in time with strategic requirements may cause the organization to miss market competitive timing, first mover position, or to suffer material loss due to failed technology choices or implementation. \n\nThe failure or disruption of our computer and communications systems, on which we are heavily dependent, could significantly harm our business. \n\nWe are heavily dependent upon automated information technology and Internet commerce, with more than half of our new customers coming from the telephone or over the Internet. We centrally manage significant components of our operations with our computer systems, including our financial information, and we also rely extensively on third-party vendors to retain data, process transactions, and provide other systems services. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, hackers, including through a ransomware attack, computer worms, viruses, and other destructive or disruptive security breaches, and catastrophic events. Such incidents could also result in significant costs to repair or replace such networks or information systems, as well as actual monetary losses in case of a breach that resulted in fraudulent payments or other cash transactions. As a result, our operations could be severely impacted by a natural disaster, terrorist attack, attack by hackers, acts of vandalism, data theft, misplaced or lost data, programming or human error, or other circumstance that results in a significant outage of our systems or those of our third party providers, despite our use of back up and redundancy measures. \n\nIf our confidential information is compromised or corrupted, including as a result of a cybersecurity breach, our reputation and business relationships could be damaged, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. \n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we acquire and store sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of our prospective and current customers and our employees. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Although we believe we have taken commercially reasonable steps to protect the security of our confidential information, information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. Despite our security measures, we have experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks and additional breaches could occur in the future. In these cases, our information technology and infrastructure could be vulnerable and our or our customers&#8217; or employees&#8217; confidential information could be compromised or misappropriated. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for us or our tenants. \n\nOur confidential information may also be compromised due to programming or human error or malfeasance. We must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes to address the evolving threat landscape, and therefore there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business from multiple regulatory agencies at the local, state, federal, or international level, compliance with those requirement could also result in additional costs, or we could fail to comply with those requirements due to various reasons such as not being aware of them. \n\nAny such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers, or damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, reputation, and competitive position. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their \n\npersonal information, which could cause them to discontinue leasing our self-storage facilities. Such events could lead to lost future revenues and adversely affect our results of operations, or result in remedial and other costs, fines, or lawsuits, which could be in excess of any available insurance that we have procured. \n\nIneffective succession planning for our CEO and executive management, as well as for our other key employees, may impact the execution of our strategic plan. \n\nWe may not effectively or appropriately identify ready-now succession candidates for our CEO and executive management team, which may negatively impact our ability to meet key strategic goals. Failure to implement succession plans for other key employees may leave us vulnerable to retirements and turnover. \n\nWe may fail to protect our intellectual property adequately. \n\nWe maintain a portfolio of trademarks and trade dress that we believe are fundamental to the success of the Public Storage&#174; brand. While we actively seek to enforce and expand our rights, our trademark and trade dress could be deemed generic and indistinct and lose protection. We also own and seek to protect other intellectual property, such as propriety systems, processes, data, and other trade secrets that we have collected and developed in the course of operating our business and that we believe provides us with various competitive advantages. Our protections could be inadequate or we could lose rights to our other intellectual property and trade secrets. Competitor use of our trademarks and trade names could lead to likelihood of confusion, tarnishment of our brand, and loss of legal protection for our marks. \n\nRisks Related to Our Ownership, Organization and Structure \n\nTakeover attempts or changes in control could be thwarted, even if beneficial to shareholders. \n\nIn certain circumstances, shareholders might desire a change in control or acquisition of us in order to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our shares or for other reasons. However, the following could prevent, deter, or delay such a transaction: \n\n&#8226; Provisions of Maryland law may impose limitations that may make it more difficult for a third party to negotiate or effect a business combination transaction or control share acquisition with Public Storage. Currently, our Board has opted not to subject the Company to these provisions of Maryland law, but it could choose to do so in the future without shareholder approval. \n\n&#8226; To protect against the loss of our REIT status due to concentration of ownership levels, our declaration of trust generally limits the ability of a person, other than the Hughes family or &#8220;designated investment entities&#8221; (each as defined in our declaration of trust), to own, actually or constructively, more than 3% of our outstanding common shares or 9.9% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of preferred or equity shares. Our Board may grant, and has previously granted, a specific exemption. These limits could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company not approved by our Board. \n\n&#8226; Similarly, current provisions of our declaration of trust and powers of our Board could have the same effect, including (1) limitations on removal of trustees, (2) restrictions on the acquisition of our shares of beneficial interest, (3) the power to issue additional common shares, preferred shares, or equity shares on terms approved by our Board without obtaining shareholder approval, (4) the advance notice provisions of our bylaws, and (5) our Board&#8217;s ability under Maryland law, without obtaining shareholder approval, to implement takeover defenses that we may not yet have and to take, or refrain from taking, other actions that could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a transaction or a change in control. \n\nHolders of our preferred shares have dividend, liquidation, and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares. \n\nHolders of our preferred shares are entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common shares. Upon liquidation, holders of our preferred shares will receive a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (or $25.00 per depositary share) plus any accrued and unpaid distributions before any payment is made to the common shareholders. These preferences may limit the amount received by our common shareholders either from ongoing distributions or upon liquidation. In addition, our preferred shareholders have the right to elect two additional \n\ndirectors to our Board whenever dividends are in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to six or more quarterly dividends, whether or not consecutive. \n\nPreferred Shareholders are subject to certain risks. \n\nHolders of our preferred shares have preference rights over our common shareholders with respect to liquidation and distributions, which give them some assurance of continued payment of their stated dividend rate, and receipt of their principal upon liquidation of the Company or redemption of their securities. However, holders of our Preferred Shares should consider the following risks: \n\n&#8226; The Company has in the past, and could in the future, issue or assume additional debt. Preferred shareholders would be subordinated to the interest and principal payments of such debt, which would increase the risk that there would not be sufficient funds to pay distributions or liquidation amounts to the preferred shareholders. \n\n&#8226; The Company has in the past, and could in the future, issue additional preferred shares that, while pari passu to the existing preferred shares, increases the risk that there would not be sufficient funds to pay distributions to the preferred shareholders. \n\n&#8226; While the Company has no plans to do so, if the Company were to lose its REIT status or no longer elect REIT status, it would no longer be required to distribute its taxable income to maintain REIT status. If, in such a circumstance, the Company ceased paying dividends, unpaid distributions to the preferred shareholders would continue to accumulate. The preferred shareholders would have the ability to elect two additional members to serve on our Board until the arrearage was cured. The preferred shareholders would not receive any compensation (such as interest) for the delay in the receipt of distributions, and it is possible that the arrearage could accumulate indefinitely. \n\n&#8226; Holders of our Preferred Shares have limited rights in the event the Company ceases to pay dividends to shareholders, and have no rights with respect to a Company decision to discontinue listing the Preferred Shares on a national securities exchange or file reports with the SEC, including following a change of control transaction. \n\nRisks Related to Government Regulations and Taxation \n\nWe would incur adverse tax consequences if we failed to qualify as a REIT, and we would have to pay substantial U.S. federal corporate income taxes. \n\nREITs are subject to a range of complex organizational and operational requirements. A qualifying REIT does not generally incur U.S. federal corporate income tax on its &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) that it distributes to its shareholders. Our REIT status is also dependent upon the REIT qualification of PSB through the end of its taxable year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of our substantial ownership interest in it prior to the closing of the PSB merger with and unaffiliated third party. We believe we have qualified as a REIT and we intend to continue to maintain our REIT status. \n\nHowever, there can be no assurance that we qualify or will continue to qualify as a REIT, because of the highly technical nature of the REIT rules, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, the possibility of unidentified issues in prior periods, or changes in our circumstances, as well as share ownership limits in our declaration of trust that do not necessarily ensure that our shareholder base is sufficiently diverse for us to qualify as a REIT. For any year we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless certain relief provisions apply (the granting of such relief could nonetheless result in significant excise or penalty taxes), we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid, we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income, and generally we would not be allowed to elect REIT status until the fifth year after such a disqualification. In addition, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, we would possibly also be subject to certain taxes enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that are applicable to non-REIT corporations, including the corporate alternative minimum tax and nondeductible one percent excise tax on certain stock repurchases. Any taxes, interest, and penalties incurred would reduce our cash available for distributions to shareholders and could negatively affect our stock price. However, for years in which we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would not be subject to REIT rules that require us to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders. \n\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the preferential tax rates available for some dividends. \n\nDividends payable by REITs may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of non-REIT corporations. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic non-REIT corporations to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts, or estates is generally 20%. Dividends paid by REITs to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate, but under current tax law, such stockholders may deduct up to 20% of ordinary dividends (i.e., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs, such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends. This may cause investors to view REIT investments as less attractive than investments in non-REIT corporations, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our stock. \n\nChanges in tax laws could negatively impact us. \n\nThe United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. We cannot predict whether, when, or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted, but these changes might include, in particular, increases in the U.S. federal income tax rates that apply to us or our shareholders in certain circumstances, possibly with retroactive effect. \n\nWe may pay some taxes, reducing cash available for shareholders. \n\nEven if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes, we may be subject to some federal, foreign, state, and local taxes on our income and property. Certain consolidated corporate subsidiaries of the Company have elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;) for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes, and are taxable as regular corporations and subject to certain limitations on intercompany transactions. If tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our TRSs to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments, and ongoing intercompany arrangements could have to change, resulting in higher ongoing tax payments. To the extent the Company is required to pay federal, foreign, state, or local taxes, or federal penalty taxes due to existing laws or changes thereto, we will have less cash available for distribution to shareholders. \n\nIn addition, certain local and state governments have imposed taxes on self-storage rent. While in most cases those taxes are paid by our customers, they increase the cost of self-storage rental to our customers and can negatively impact our revenues. Other local and state governments may impose self-storage rent taxes in the future. \n\nWe have exposure to increased property tax in California. \n\nApproximately $767.2 million of our 2022 net operating income is from our properties in California, and we incurred approximately $47.2 million in related property tax expense. Due to the impact of Proposition 13, which generally limits increases in assessed values to 2% per year, the assessed value and resulting property tax we pay is less than it would be if the properties were assessed at current values. From time to time, proposals have been made to reduce the beneficial impact of Proposition 13, most recently in the November 2020 ballot. While this ballot initiative failed, there can be no assurance that future initiatives or other legislative actions will not eliminate or reduce the benefit of Proposition 13 with respect to our properties. If the beneficial effect of Proposition 13 were ended for our properties, our property tax expense could increase substantially, adversely affecting our cash flow from operations and net income. \n\nWe are subject to new and changing legislation and regulations, including the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). \n\nWe are subject to new and changing legislation and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and legislation regarding property taxes, income taxes, REIT status, labor and employment, privacy, and lien sales at the city, county, state, and federal level, which could materially impact our business and operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policies may subject us to increased litigation and regulatory actions and negatively affect our business and operations or reputation. \n\nOn November 3, 2020, Californians passed a ballot measure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;). The CPRA amends and expands the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, provides new rights and amends existing rights \n\nfound in the CCPA. It also creates a new privacy enforcement authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency (&#8220;CalPPA&#8221;). The CPRA grants the Attorney General and the CalPPA the authority to issue regulations on a wide range of topics. It therefore remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the CPRA or how it will be interpreted. While we believe we have developed processes to comply with current privacy requirements, a regulatory agency may not agree with certain of our implementation decisions, which could subject us to litigation, regulatory actions, or changes to our business practices that could increase costs or reduce revenues. Other states have also enacted or are considering enacting privacy laws similar to those passed in California. Similar laws may be implemented in other jurisdictions in which we do business and in ways that may be more restrictive than those in California, increasing the cost of compliance, as well as the risk of noncompliance, on our business. \n\nOur tenant reinsurance business is subject to governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth. \n\nWe hold Limited Lines Self-Service Storage Insurance Agent licenses from a number of individual state departments of insurance and are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision. Our continued ability to maintain these Limited Lines Self-Service Storage Insurance Agent licenses in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed depends on our compliance with related rules and regulations. The regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction generally have broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret, and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits, and investigations of the affairs of insurance agents. As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities , or otherwise fined, penalized, or subject to an adverse judgment, which could reduce our net income. \n\n"

The oldest facilities are comprised generally of multiple single-story buildings, and have on average approximately 500 primarily &#8220;drive up&#8221; spaces per facility, and a small rental office. The most prevalent recently constructed facilities have higher density footprints with large, multi-story buildings with climate control and 1,000 or more self-storage spaces, a more imposing and visible retail presence, and a \n\nprominent and large rental office designed to appeal to customers as an attractive and retail-focused &#8220;store.&#8221; Our self-storage portfolio includes facilities with characteristics of the oldest facilities, characteristics of the most recently constructed facilities, and those with characteristics of both older and recently constructed facilities.

      "text": " ITEM 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nManagement&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates: \n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. \n\nWe believe the following are our critical accounting estimates, because they are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that involve a significant level of uncertainty. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets: The analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets, including our real estate facilities, involves identification of indicators of impairment, including unfavorable operational results and significant cost overruns on construction, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. In particular, these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the projections of future rental rates, stabilized occupancy level, future profit margin, discount rates, and capitalization rates, all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions. Others could come to materially different conclusions. \n\nAllocating Purchase Price for Acquired Real Estate Facilities : We estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities of acquired real estate facilities, which consist principally of land and buildings, for purposes of allocating the aggregate purchase price of acquired real estate facilities. We estimate the fair value of land based upon price per square foot derived from observable transactions involving comparable land in similar locations as adjusted for location quality, parcel size, and date of sale associated with the acquired facilities. The fair value estimate of land is sensitive to the adjustments made to the land market transactions used in the estimate, particularly when there is a lack of recent comparable land market data. For large portfolio acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of buildings primarily using the income approach by estimating the fair value of hypothetical vacant acquired facilities and adjusting for the estimated fair value of land. For individual and small portfolio acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of buildings primarily based upon the estimated current replacement cost, which we calculate by estimating the replacement cost of new purpose-built self-storage facilities in similar geographic regions and adjusting for age, quality, amenities, and configuration associated with \n\nthe buildings acquired. The fair value estimate of buildings is sensitive to assumptions used in both the income approach, such as lease-up period, future stabilized operating cash flows, capitalization rate and discount rate, and in the replacement cost approach, such as current cost adjustment, soft cost and developer profit estimates. Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values of land and buildings, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, as well as the level of land and buildings on our consolidated balance sheet. \n\nOverview \n\nOur self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and our earnings growth is impacted by the levels of growth within our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) as well as within our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities (both as defined below). Accordingly, a significant portion of management&#8217;s time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facility portfolio. \n\nDuring 2022, revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 14.8% ($409.9 million), as compared to 2021, while Same Store cost of operations increased by 5.7% ($39.9 million). Demand and operating trends softened in the second half of 2022 and returned to historical seasonal patterns as compared to what we experienced in 2020 and 2021. We expect the trends to continue in 2023. \n\nIn addition to managing our existing facilities for organic growth, we have grown and plan to continue to grow through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities. Since the beginning of 2020, we acquired a total of 368 facilities with 31.7 million net rentable square feet for $6.6 billion. In our non-same store portfolio, we also have developed and expanded self-storage facilities of 17.7 million net rentable square feet for a total cost of $1.6 billion. During 2022, net operating income generated by our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities increased 98.2% ($226.3 million), as compared to 2021. \n\nWe have experienced recent inflationary impacts on our cost of operations, including labor, utilities, and repairs and maintenance, and costs of development and expansion activities, and we may continue to experience such impacts in the future. We have implemented various initiatives to manage the adverse impacts, such as enhancements in operational processes and investments in technology to reduce payroll hours, achievement of economies of scale from recent acquisitions with supervisory payroll allocated over a broader number of self-storage facilities, and investments in solar power and LED lights to lower utility usage. \n\nIn order to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors (including newly developed facilities), we have embarked on our multi-year Property of Tomorrow program to (i) rebrand our properties with more pronounced, attractive, and clearly identifiable color schemes and signage, (ii) enhance the energy efficiency of our properties, and (iii) upgrade the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. We expect to complete the program by the end of 2025. We spent approximately $189 million on the program in 2022 and expect to spend approximately $160 million in 2023 on this effort. \n\nOn April 24, 2022, PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (&#8220;Blackstone&#8221;) agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB&#8217;s common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20, 2022, PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit, including a $5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit, and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit, for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction, we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion, which was classified within gain on sale of our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nIn connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB, on August 4, 2022, we paid a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share, totaling approximately $2.3 billion, to shareholders of record as of August 1, 2022. \n\nOn February 5, 2023, we disclosed that we made a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of Life Storage for consideration consisting of Public Storage common shares at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 Public Storage common shares for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. Our public offer followed prior rebuffs by Life Storage of our attempts to negotiate privately. For more detail about the proposal, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 6, 2023. On February 16, 2023, Life Storage announced it had rejected the offer. We currently \n\nintend to pursue the proposed transaction. In the event we enter into and consummate an acquisition of Life Storage, the acquisition would have a significant impact on our future results of operations. \n\nOn February 4, 2023, our Board of Trustees declared a 50% increase in its regular common quarterly dividend from $2.00 to $3.00 per share, payable on March 30, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2023. The distribution equates to an annualized increase to the Company&#8217;s regular common dividend from $8.00 to $12.00 per share. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nOperating Results for 2022 and 2021 \n\nIn 2022, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $4,142.3 million or $23.50 per diluted common share, compared to $1,732.4 million or $9.87 per diluted common share in 2021, representing an increase of $2,409.9 million or $13.63 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB and (ii) a $614.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income, partially offset by (iii) a $174.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) a $125.1 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to sale of our equity investment in PSB, and (v) a $45.5 million increase in interest expense. \n\nThe $614.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2022 as compared to 2021 is a result of a $370.1 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $244.2 million increase attributable to our non-same store facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 14.8% or $409.9 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.7% or $39.9 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $244.2 million for the non-same store facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities. \n\nOperating Results for 2021 and 2020 \n\nIn 2021, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,732.4 million or $9.87 per diluted common share, compared to $1,098.3 million or $6.29 per diluted common share in 2020, representing an increase of $634.1 million or $3.58 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $437.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income, (ii) a $209.7 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains associated with our Euro denominated notes payable, and (iii) our $149.0 million equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by PSB in 2021, partially offset by (iv) a $160.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. \n\nThe $437.4 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2021 as compared to 2020 is a result of a $279.5 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $157.9 million increase in our non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 10.6% or $265.8 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot and weighted average square foot occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities decreased by 1.9% or $13.8 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to (i) a 36.1% ($22.4 million) decrease in marketing expenses and (ii) an 11.2% ($14.4 million) decrease in on-site property manager payroll. The increase in net operating income of $157.9 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2020 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities. \n\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations \n\nFunds from Operations (&#8220;FFO&#8221;) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit&#8217;s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, FFO was $16.46 per diluted common share as compared to $13.36 and $9.75 per diluted common share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase in 2022 of 23.2%, or $3.10 per diluted common share, as compared to 2021. \n\nWe also present &#8220;Core FFO&#8221; and &#8220;Core FFO per share&#8221; non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of loss contingency accruals and casualties, unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs, severance of a senior executive, lease termination income, and casualties from our equity investees . We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share.

We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating property operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, operating cash flow, or other related financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. See Note 13 to our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our total net income for all periods presented. \n\nSame Store Facilities \n\nThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities we have owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us more effectively to evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe investors and analysts use Same Store information in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. \n\nThe following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,276 facilities (149.1 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 73% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2022. It includes various measures and detail that we do not include in the analysis of the developed, acquired, and other non-same store facilities, due to the relative magnitude and importance of the Same Store Facilities relative to our other self-storage facilities. \n\nSelected Operating Data for the Same Store Facilities (2,276 facilities) \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Percentage Change 2021 2020 Percentage Change &#160; (Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 3,074,192 $ 2,683,116 14.6% $ 2,683,116 $ 2,415,822 11.1% Late charges and administrative fees 101,015 82,147 23.0% 82,147 83,664 (1.8)% Total revenues 3,175,207 2,765,263 14.8% 2,765,263 2,499,486 10.6% Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 279,388 267,961 4.3% 267,961 258,453 3.7% On-site property manager payroll 119,139 114,426 4.1% 114,426 128,819 (11.2)% Repairs and maintenance 58,468 52,703 10.9% 52,703 50,700 4.0% Utilities 43,457 40,548 7.2% 40,548 41,345 (1.9)% Marketing 45,906 39,682 15.7% 39,682 62,101 (36.1)% Other direct property costs 80,991 73,646 10.0% 73,646 68,332 7.8% Total direct cost of operations 627,349 588,966 6.5% 588,966 609,750 (3.4)% Direct net operating income (b) 2,547,858 2,176,297 17.1% 2,176,297 1,889,736 15.2% Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (35,017) (37,058) (5.5)% (37,058) (40,965) (9.5)% Centralized management costs (61,922) (55,350) 11.9% (55,350) (49,129) 12.7% Share-based compensation (14,203) (17,255) (17.7)% (17,255) (12,546) 37.5% Net operating income 2,436,716 2,066,634 17.9% 2,066,634 1,787,096 15.6% Depreciation and amortization expense (471,458) (451,802) 4.4% (451,802) (452,622) (0.2)% Net income $ 1,965,258 $ 1,614,832 21.7% $ 1,614,832 $ 1,334,474 21.0% Gross margin (before indirect costs, depreciation and amortization expense) 80.2% 78.7% 1.9% 78.7% 75.6% 4.1% Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 76.7% 74.7% 2.7% 74.7% 71.5% 4.5% Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 94.9% 96.3% (1.5)% 96.3% 94.5% 1.9% Realized annual rental income per (c): Occupied square foot $ 21.73 $ 18.67 16.4% $ 18.67 $ 17.15 8.9% Available square foot $ 20.61 $ 17.99 14.6% $ 17.99 $ 16.20 11.0% \n\nAt December 31: \n\nSquare foot occupancy 92.4% 94.8% (2.5)% 94.8% 94.2% 0.6% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (d) $ 23.02 $ 19.96 15.3% $ 19.96 $ 17.81 12.1% ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities. See &#8220;Ancillary Operations&#8221; below for more information. \n\n(b) Direct net operating income (&#8220;Direct NOI&#8221;), a subtotal within NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. \n\n(c) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (&#8220;REVPAF&#8221;) is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income. \n\n(d) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible. \n\nAnalysis of Same Store Revenue \n\nWe believe a balanced occupancy and rate strategy maximizes our revenues over time. We regularly adjust rental rates and promotional discounts offered (generally, &#8220;$1.00 rent for the first month&#8221;), as well as our marketing efforts to maximize revenue from new tenants to replace tenants that vacate. \n\nWe typically increase rental rates to our long-term tenants (generally, those who have been with us for at least a year) every six to twelve months. As a result, the number of long-term tenants we have in our facilities is an important factor in our revenue growth. The level of rate increases to long-term tenants is based upon evaluating the additional revenue from the increase against the negative impact of incremental move-outs, by considering customers&#8217; in-place rent and prevailing market rents, among other factors. \n\nRevenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased 14.8% and 10.6% in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year. The increase in 2022 is due primarily to (i) a 16.4% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot for 2022 as compared to 2021, partially offset by (ii) a 1.5% decrease in average occupancy for 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase in 2021 is due primarily to (i) an 8.9% increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot for 2021 as compared to 2020 and, to a lesser extent, (ii) a 1.9% increase in average occupancy for 2021 as compared to 2020. \n\nOur growth in revenues, realized annual rent per occupied square foot, and REVPAF for 2022 as compared to 2021 was evident in each of our markets. Our weighted average square foot occupancy remained strong across our markets for 2022. \n\nThe increase in realized annual rent per occupied square foot in 2022 as compared to the same periods in 2021 was due to rate increases to existing long-term tenants in substantially all of our markets in 2022 as compared to curtailed increases in certain markets in 2021, combined with a 6.2% increase in average rates per square foot charged to new tenants moving in, as a result of strong customer demand in most of our markets. These improvements were partially offset by increases in move-out activity and promotional discounts given during 2022 as compared to 2021. At December 31, 2022, annual contract rent per occupied square foot was 15.3% higher as compared to December 31, 2021. \n\nWe experienced high occupancy levels throughout 2022 with a weighted average square foot occupancy of 94.9%, although representing a decrease of 1.5% during 2022 as compared to 2021. Year-over-year move-out volumes increased 9.7% and year-over-year move-in volumes increased 4.5% in 2022 as compared to 2021, leading to a lower square foot occupancy at December 31, 2022 of 92.4% as compared to 94.8% at December 31, 2021. \n\nMove-out volumes were partially impacted by rental rate increases to our existing tenants in 2022 as compared to 2021. However, move-out activity from tenants not receiving increases was also higher in 2022 compared to 2021 but remains below pre-2020 levels. Average length of stay of our tenants increased in 2022 as compared to 2021, which supported our revenue growth by contributing to the number of tenants eligible for rental rate increases in 2022. \n\nIn order to attract more new tenants to replace those that vacated in the second half of 2022, we took a number of actions including increasing promotional discounting, reducing rental rates to new customers, and increasing marketing expense. \n\nDemand historically has been higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants have typically been higher in the summer months than in the winter months. More typical seasonal patterns of demand with lower demand in the winter months returned in 2022. Demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand for our facilities is also impacted by new supply of self-storage space and alternatives to self-storage. \n\nWe expect weaker demand in 2023 as compared to 2022 driven by a weaker macroeconomic outlook and more limited moving activities, with move-out activities and occupancy levels returning to pre-2020 levels. We will continue to support demand levels with increased marketing expense, lowering rental rates to new customers, and increased promotional discounting. As a result, we expect revenue growth to decline significantly in 2023 as compared to high levels of growth in 2022 and 2021. With a wide range of potential macroeconomic pathways for 2023, the range of potential revenue growth rates is wide including the potential for year-over-year declines in revenue in the second half of 2023. \n\nLate Charges and Administrative Fees \n\nLate charges and administrative fees increased 23.0% in 2022 and decreased 1.8% in 2021, in each case as compared to the previous year. The increase in 2022 is due to (i) higher late charges collected on delinquent accounts driven by more delinquent accounts compared to 2021 and to a lesser extent (ii) higher administrative fees charged per move-in combined with higher move-in volumes. The decrease in 2021 as compared to 2020 is due to (i) an acceleration in average collections whereby a greater percentage of tenants paid their monthly rent promptly to avoid the incurrence of such fees and (ii) reduced move-in administrative fees due to lower move-ins. \n\nSelected Key Statistical Data \n\nThe following table sets forth average annual contract rent per square foot and total square footage for tenants moving in and moving out during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. It also includes promotional discounts, which vary based upon the move-in contractual rates, move-in volume, and percentage of tenants moving in who receive the discount. \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2021 2020 Change (Amounts in thousands, except for per square foot amounts) Tenants moving in during the period: Average annual contract rent per square foot $ 18.11 $ 17.06 6.2% $ 17.06 $ 13.53 26.1% Square footage 97,783 93,607 4.5% 93,607 104,636 (10.5)% Contract rents gained from move-ins $ 1,770,850 $ 1,596,935 10.9% $ 1,596,935 $ 1,415,725 12.8% Promotional discounts given $ 46,087 $ 38,203 20.6% $ 38,203 $ 75,785 (49.6)% Tenants moving out during the period: Average annual contract rent per square foot $ 20.65 $ 17.52 17.9% $ 17.52 $ 15.52 12.9% Square footage 101,399 92,466 9.7% 92,466 100,670 (8.1)% Contract rents lost from move-outs $ 2,093,889 $ 1,620,004 29.3% $ 1,620,004 $ 1,562,398 3.7% ##TABLE_END\n\nAnalysis of Same Store Cost of Operations \n\nCost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased 5.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021 due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased 1.9% in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to decreased marketing expense and on-site property manager payroll expense, partially offset by increased property tax expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. \n\nProperty tax expense increased 4.3% and 3.7% in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in each case as compared to the previous year, as a result of higher assessed values. We expected property tax expense growth of approximately 5.3% in 2023 due primarily to higher assessed values. \n\nOn-site property manager payroll expense increased 4.1% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and decreased 11.2% in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in 2022 is primarily due to competitive labor conditions experienced in most geographical markets, partially offset by a decline in hours worked driven by revisions in operational processes. The decrease in 2021 is primarily due to (i) a year-over-year decline in hours worked due to staffing reductions from reduced move-in and move-out activity and revisions to other operational processes and (ii) a temporary $3.00 hourly incentive increase and enhancement of paid time off benefits to all of our property managers between April 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 in response to the COVID Pandemic, partially offset by wage increases in response to competitive labor conditions experienced in most geographical markets since the second quarter of 2021. We expect on-site property manager payroll expense to increase in 2023 driven by increased wage rates, partially offset by expected reduction in labor hours driven by revisions in operational processes. \n\nMarketing expense includes Internet advertising and the operating costs of our telephone reservation center. Internet advertising expense, comprising keyword search fees assessed on a &#8220;per click&#8221; basis, varies based upon demand for self-storage space, the quantity of people inquiring about self-storage through online search, occupancy levels, the number and aggressiveness of bidding competitors, and other factors. These factors are volatile; accordingly, Internet advertising can increase or decrease significantly in the short-term. We increased marketing expense by 15.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021, by utilizing a higher volume of online paid search programs to attract new tenants. We decreased marketing expense by 36.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to lower volume of paid search programs we utilized in 2021 given strong demand and high occupancies in many of our same store properties. \n\nOther direct property costs include administrative expenses specific to each self-storage facility, such as property loss, telephone and data communication lines, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the facilities&#8217; cash receipts, tenant mailings, credit card fees, eviction costs, and the cost of operating each property&#8217;s rental office. These costs increased 10.0% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and 7.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020. These increases were due primarily to an increase in credit card fees as result of year-over-year increases in revenues, and to a lesser extent, a long-term trend of more customers paying with credit cards rather than cash, checks, or other methods of payment with lower transaction costs. We expect a moderate increase in other direct property costs in 2023 primarily driven by increase in credit card fees. \n\nCentralized management costs represents administrative and cash compensation expenses for shared general corporate functions to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations. Such functions include information technology support, hardware, and software, as well as centralized administration of payroll, benefits, training, facilities management, customer service, pricing and marketing, operational accounting and finance, and legal costs. Centralized management costs increased 11.9% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and 12.7% in 2021 as compared to 2020. These increases were due primarily to an increase in technology and data team costs that support property operations. We expect centralized managements costs to remain flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nAnalysis of Market Trends \n\nThe following tables set forth selected market trends in our Same Store Facilities: \n\nSame Store Facilities Operating Trends by Market \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; As of December 31, 2022 \n\nYear Ended December 31, &#160; Number of Facilities Square Feet (millions) Realized Rent per Occupied Square Foot Average Occupancy Realized Rent per Available Square Foot &#160; 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change 2022 2021 Change Los Angeles 212 15.3 $ 32.55 $ 27.32 19.1 % 96.9 % 98.2 % (1.3) % $ 31.55 $ 26.83 17.6 % San Francisco 128 7.8 31.43 28.08 11.9 % 95.3 % 97.2 % (2.0) % 29.95 27.29 9.7 % New York 90 6.4 30.60 27.44 11.5 % 94.5 % 96.3 % (1.9) % 28.92 26.43 9.4 % Miami 83 5.8 27.92 22.42 24.5 % 95.6 % 97.1 % (1.5) % 26.70 21.77 22.6 % Seattle-Tacoma 86 5.7 25.11 21.95 14.4 % 94.2 % 95.3 % (1.2) % 23.67 20.93 13.1 % Washington DC 90 5.5 25.42 22.65 12.2 % 93.4 % 95.3 % (2.0) % 23.74 21.58 10.0 % Chicago 129 8.1 19.28 16.63 15.9 % 93.6 % 95.7 % (2.2) % 18.05 15.92 13.4 % Dallas-Ft.

Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities across five states with 0.5 million net rentable square feet, for $70.5 million. Future acquisition volume is likely to be impacted by increasing cost of capital requirements and overall macro-economic uncertainties. \n\nDeveloped and Expanded Facilities \n\nThe developed and expanded facilities include 62 facilities that were developed on new sites since January 1, 2017, and 91 facilities expanded to increase their net rentable square footage. Of these expansions, 51 were completed before 2021, 27 were completed in 2021 or 2022, and 13 are currently in process at December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes operating data with respect to the Developed and Expanded Facilities: \n\n##TABLE_START DEVELOPED AND EXPANDED FACILITIES Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change (a) 2021 2020 Change (a) ($ amounts in thousands, except for per square foot amounts) Revenues (b): Developed in 2017 $ 35,216 $ 27,593 $ 7,623 $ 27,593 $ 21,541 $ 6,052 Developed in 2018 36,789 28,308 8,481 28,308 20,163 8,145 Developed in 2019 16,444 11,921 4,523 11,921 6,455 5,466 Developed in 2020 6,838 3,405 3,433 3,405 301 3,104 Developed in 2021 8,333 1,602 6,731 1,602 &#8212;

$ 1,620,158 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Represents the percentage change with respect to square foot occupancy and annual contract rent per occupied square foot, and the absolute nominal change with respect to all other items. \n\n(b) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales generated at the facilities. See &#8220;Ancillary Operations&#8221; below for more information. \n\n(c) The facilities included above have an aggregate of approximately 17.7 million net rentable square feet at December 31, 2022, including 5.0 million in Texas, 3.2 million in Florida, 2.2 million in California, 1.5 million in Colorado, 1.4 million in Minnesota, 0.9 million in North Carolina, 0.7 million in Michigan, 0.4 million in each of Missouri, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Washington, 0.3 million in Virginia, and 0.9 million in other states. \n\n(d) These amounts only include the direct cost incurred to expand and renovate these facilities, and do not include (i) the original cost to develop or acquire the facility or (ii) the lost revenue on space demolished during the construction and fill-up period. \n\nIt typically takes at least three to four years for a newly developed or expanded self-storage facility to stabilize with respect to revenues. Physical occupancy can be achieved as early as two to three years following completion of the development or expansion through offering lower rental rates during fill-up. As a result, even after achieving high occupancy, there can still be a period of elevated revenue growth as the tenant base matures and higher rental rates are achieved. \n\nWe believe that our development and redevelopment activities generate favorable risk-adjusted returns over the long run. However, in the short run, our earnings are diluted during the construction and stabilization period due to the cost of capital to fund the development cost, as well as the related construction and development overhead expenses included in general and administrative expense. \n\nWe typically underwrite new developments to stabilize at approximately an 8.0% NOI yield on cost. Our developed facilities have thus far leased up as expected and are at various stages of their revenue stabilization periods. The actual annualized yields that we may achieve on these facilities upon stabilization will depend on many factors, including local and current market conditions in the vicinity of each property and the level of new and existing supply. \n\nThe facilities under &#8220;expansions completed&#8221; represent those facilities where the expansions have been completed at December 31, 2022. We incurred a total of $709.9 million in direct cost to expand these facilities, demolished a total of 1.2 million net rentable square feet of storage space, and built a total of 6.3 million net rentable square feet of new storage space. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had 22 additional facilities in development, which will have a total of 2.1 million net rentable square feet of storage space and have an aggregate development cost totaling approximately $492.3 million. We expect these facilities to open over the next 18 to 24 months. \n\nThe facilities under &#8220;expansion in process&#8221; represent those facilities where construction is in process at December 31, 2022, and together with additional future expansion activities primarily related to our Same Store Facilities at December 31, 2022, we expect to add a total of 2.5 million net rentable square feet of storage space by expanding existing self-storage facilities for an aggregate direct development cost of $487.3 million. \n\nOther Non-Same Store Facilities \n\nThe &#8220;Other Non-Same Store Facilities&#8221; represent facilities which, while not newly acquired, developed, or expanded, are not fully stabilized since January 1, 2020, including facilities undergoing fill-up as well as facilities damaged in casualty events such as hurricanes, floods, and fires. \n\nThe Other Non-Same Store Facilities have an aggregate of 5.7 million net rentable square feet, including 1.1 million in Texas, 0.6 million in each of Florida and Washington, 0.4 million in each of California and Virginia, 0.3 million in each of Indiana and South Carolina, 0.2 million in each of Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Tennessee, and 1.0 million in other states. \n\nDuring 2022, 2021, and 2020, the average occupancy for these facilities totaled 91.4%, 92.7%, and 85.5%, respectively, and the realized rent per occupied square foot totaled $18.42, $14.61, and $12.69, respectively. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expense \n\nDepreciation and amortization expense for Self-Storage Operations increased $174.7 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased $160.2 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to newly acquired facilities of $5.1 billion in 2021. We expect continued increases in depreciation expense in 2023 as a result of elevated levels of capital expenditures and new facilities that are acquired, developed or expanded in 2023. \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the components of net income, including Ancillary Operations and items not allocated to segments, present a comparison for the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021. The results of these components for the years ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 on page 23, under Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022. \n\nAncillary Operations \n\nAncillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities, sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities, and management of property owned by unrelated third parties. The following table sets forth our ancillary operations: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Change &#160; (Amounts in thousands) Revenues: Tenant reinsurance premiums $ 188,201 $ 166,585 $ 21,616 Merchandise 28,303 28,466 (163) Third party property management 19,631 17,207 2,424 Total revenues 236,135 212,258 23,877 Cost of operations: Tenant reinsurance 36,830 33,932 2,898 Merchandise 17,113 17,274 (161) Third party property management 18,755 17,362 1,393 Total cost of operations 72,698 68,568 4,130 Net operating income (loss): Tenant reinsurance 151,371 132,653 18,718 Merchandise 11,190 11,192 (2) Third party property management 876 (155) 1,031 Total net operating income $ 163,437 $ 143,690 $ 19,747 ##TABLE_END\n\nTenant reinsurance operations: Tenant reinsurance premium revenue increased $21.6 million or 13.0% in 2022 over 2021, as a result of an increase in our tenant base with respect to acquired, newly developed, and expanded facilities and the third party properties we manage. Tenant reinsurance premium revenue generated from tenants at our Same-Store Facilities were $139.0 million and $133.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a 3.8% year over year increase in 2022. \n\nWe expect future growth will come primarily from customers of newly acquired and developed facilities, as well as additional tenants at our existing unstabilized self-storage facilities. \n\nCost of operations primarily includes claims paid as well as claims adjustment expenses. Claims expenses vary based upon the number of insured tenants and the volume of events that drive covered customer losses, such as burglary, as well as catastrophic weather events affecting multiple properties such as hurricanes and floods. Included in cost of operations are $2.7 million of estimated claims costs related to Hurricane Ian for 2022, as compared to $2.0 million of estimated claims costs related to Hurricane Ida for 2021. \n\nMerchandise sales: Sales of locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities are primarily impacted by the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities. We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our merchandise sales in 2023. \n\nThird-party property management: At December 31, 2022, in our third-party property management program, we managed 114 facilities for unrelated third parties, and were under contract to manage 78 additional facilities including 73 \n\nfacilities that are currently under construction. During 2022, we added 60 facilities to the program, acquired three facilities from the program, and had 17 properties exit the program due to sales to other buyers. While we expect this business to increase in scope and size, we do not expect any significant changes in overall profitability of this business in the near term as we seek new properties to manage and are in the earlier stages of fill-up for newly managed properties. \n\nAnalysis of items not allocated to segments \n\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities \n\nWe account for the equity investments in PSB and Shurgard using the equity method and record our pro-rata share of the net income of these entities. The following table, and the discussion below, sets forth our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Change &#160; (Amounts in thousands) Equity in earnings: PSB $ 80,596 $ 207,722 $ (127,126) Shurgard 26,385 24,371 2,014 Total equity in earnings $ 106,981 $ 232,093 $ (125,112) ##TABLE_END\n\nInvestment in PSB: On April 24, 2022, PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB&#8217;s common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20, 2022, PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit, including a $5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit, and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit, for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction, we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion, which was classified within gain on sale of our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accordingly, equity in earnings from PSB for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflect activities through the merger date, July 20, 2022. \n\nIncluded in our equity earnings from PSB is our equity share of gains on sale of real estate totaling $49.1 million and $149.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our equity share of earnings from PSB contributed $57.7 million and $99.3 million to Core FFO in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nAs a result of closing the sale of PSB, we will no longer recognize equity in earnings from PSB in the future. \n\nInvestment in Shurgard: Included in our equity earnings from Shurgard for the year ended December 31, 2022 is our equity share of gains on sale of real estate totaling $3.5 million. \n\nFor purposes of recording our equity in earnings from Shurgard, the Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.070 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2022 (1.134 at December 31, 2021), and average exchange rates of 1.054 for 2022 and 1.183 for 2021. Accordingly, our equity in earnings from Shurgard was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro by approximately 10.9% during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nGeneral and administrative expense: The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 Change &#160; (Amounts in thousands) Share-based compensation expense $ 37,865 $ 37,760 $ 105 Development and acquisition costs 17,540 8,892 8,648 Federal and State tax expense and related compliance costs 16,086 11,530 4,556 Legal costs 4,014 6,194 (2,180) Corporate management costs 21,808 18,594 3,214 Other costs 17,429 18,284 (855) Total $ 114,742 $ 101,254 $ 13,488 ##TABLE_END\n\nDevelopment and acquisition costs primarily represent internal and external expenses related to our development and acquisition of real estate facilities and varies primarily based upon the level of activities. The amounts in the above table are net of $17.4 million and $14.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in development costs that were capitalized to newly developed and redeveloped self-storage facilities. During 2022, we wrote off $7.0 million of accumulated development costs for cancelled development and redevelopment projects driven by significant increases in construction costs from when the projects were initiated. \n\nInterest and other income: The following table sets forth our interest and other income: \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change (Amounts in thousands) Interest earned on cash balances $ 20,824 $ 101 $ 20,723 Commercial operations 9,846 8,127 1,719 Unrealized gain on private equity investments 4,685 &#8212; 4,685 Other 5,212 4,078 1,134 Total $ 40,567 $ 12,306 $ 28,261 ##TABLE_END\n\nInterest expense: For 2022 and 2021, we incurred $142.4 million and $94.3 million, respectively, of interest on our outstanding notes payable. In determining interest expense, these amounts were offset by capitalized interest of $6.0 million and $3.5 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, associated with our development activities. The increase of interest expense in 2022 as compared to 2021 is due to our issuances of debt to fund our 2021 acquisition activity. At December 31, 2022, we had $6.9 billion of notes payable outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.0%. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Gain: For 2022, we recorded foreign currency gains of $98.3 million, representing primarily the changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-denominated unsecured notes due to fluctuations in exchange rates (gains of $111.8 million for 2021). The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.070 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2022 and 1.134 at December 31, 2021. Future gains and losses on foreign currency will be dependent upon changes in the relative value of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar and the level of Euro-denominated notes payable outstanding. \n\nGain on Sale of Real Estate: In 2022 and 2021, we recorded gains on sale of real estate totaling $1.5 million and $13.7 million, respectively, in connection with the partial sale of real estate facilities pursuant to eminent domain proceedings. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nOverview and our Sources of Capital \n\nWhile operating as a REIT allows us to minimize the payment of U.S. federal corporate income tax expense, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Notwithstanding this requirement, our annual operating retained cash flow increased from $200 million to $300 million per year in recent years to approximately $700 million in 2021 and $1 billion in 2022. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities (including property operating costs and interest payments described below), less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures. We expect retained cash flow of approximately $500 million for 2023. \n\nThe REIT distribution requirement limits cash flow from operations that can be retained and reinvested in the business, increasing our reliance upon raising capital to fund growth. Capital needs in excess of retained cash flow are met with: (i) medium and long-term debt, (ii) preferred equity, and (iii) common equity. We select among these sources of capital based upon relative cost, availability, the desire for leverage, and considering potential constraints caused by certain features of capital sources, such as debt covenants. We view our line of credit, as well as any short-term bank loans, as bridge financing. \n\nBecause raising capital is important to our growth, we endeavor to maintain a strong financial profile characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. We are one of the highest rated REITs, as rated by major rating agencies Moody&#8217;s and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s. Our senior notes payable have an &#8220;A&#8221; credit rating by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and &#8220;A2&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s. Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are &#8220;A3&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s and &#8220;BBB+&#8221; by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s. Our credit profile enables us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital. \n\nWe have a $500.0 million revolving line of credit that we are able to use as temporary &#8220;bridge&#8221; financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. As of December 31, 2022 and February 21, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit; however, we do have approximately $18.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, which limits our borrowing capacity to $481.4 million as of February 21, 2023. Our line of credit matures on April 19, 2024. \n\nWe believe that we have significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and opportunities, and we have significant access to sources of capital including debt and preferred equity. While the costs of financing have increased recently, based on our strong credit profile and our substantial current liquidity relative to our capital requirements noted below, we would not expect any potential capital market dislocations to have a material impact upon our expected capital and growth plans over the next 12 months. However, if capital market conditions were to change significantly in the long run, our access to or cost of debt and preferred equity capital could be negatively impacted and potentially affect future investment activities. \n\nOur current and expected capital resources include: (i) $775.3 million of cash as of December 31, 2022 and (ii) approximately $500.0 million of expected retained operating cash flow over the next twelve months. We believe that our cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing cash requirements for interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future. \n\nAs described below, our current committed cash requirements consist of (i) $70.5 million in property acquisitions currently under contract and (ii) $606.6 million of remaining spending on our current development pipeline, which will be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. Our cash requirements may increase over the next year as we add projects to our development pipeline and acquire additional properties. Additional potential cash requirements could result from various activities including the redemption of outstanding preferred securities, repurchases of common stock, or merger and acquisition activities, as and to the extent we determine to engage in such activities. \n\nOver the long term, to the extent that our cash requirements exceed our capital resources, we believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital including issuing common or preferred securities, issuing debt, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities. \n\nCash Requirements \n\nThe following summarizes our expected material cash requirements, which comprise (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest, (ii) other essential expenditures, including property operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid in accordance with REIT distribution requirements, and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including acquisitions and developments and repurchases of our securities. We expect to satisfy these cash requirements through operating cash flow and opportunistic debt and equity financings. \n\nRequired Debt Repayments: As of December 31, 2022, the principal outstanding on our debt totaled approximately $6.9 billion, consisting of $10.1 million of secured notes payable, $1.7 billion of Euro-denominated unsecured notes payable and $5.3 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured notes payable. Approximate principal maturities and interest payments are as follows (amounts in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 $ 151,532 2024 933,385 2025 367,561 2026 1,251,404 2027 587,643 Thereafter 4,349,115 &#160; $ 7,640,640 ##TABLE_END\n\nCapital Expenditure Requirements: Capital expenditures include general maintenance, major repairs, or replacements to elements of our facilities to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal. Capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or redevelopment of existing facilities to increase their available rentable square footage. \n\nCapital expenditures totaled $452.3 million in 2022 and are expected to approximate $450 million in 2023. In addition to standard capital repairs of building elements reaching the end of their useful lives, our capital expenditures in recent years have included incremental expenditures to enhance the competitive position of certain of our facilities relative to local competitors pursuant to a multi-year program. Such investments include development of more pronounced, attractive, and clearly identifiable color schemes and signage and upgrades to the configuration and layout of the offices and other customer zones to improve the customer experience. We spent approximately $189 million in 2022 and expect to spend $160 million in 2023 on this effort. In addition, we have made investments in LED lighting and the installation of solar panels, which approximated $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and we expect to spend $132 million in 2023. \n\nWe believe that these incremental investments improve customer satisfaction, the attractiveness and competitiveness of our facilities to new and existing customers and, in the case of LED lighting and solar panels, reduce operating costs. \n\nRequirement to Pay Distributions: For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Code. For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. \n\nOn February 4, 2023, our Board declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share totaling approximately $526 million, which will be paid at the end of March 2023. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash flows from operating activities. Our future aggregate annual common dividend distributions may increase as a result of the issuance of additional common shares, including any shares that would be issued if we were to consummate our recently proposed acquisition of Life Storage. \n\nThe annual distribution requirement with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2022 is approximately $194.7 million per year. \n\nReal Estate Investment Activities: We continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities for a total purchase price of $70.5 million. \n\nWe are actively seeking to acquire additional facilities. However, future acquisition volume will depend upon whether additional owners will be motivated to market their facilities, which will in turn depend upon factors such as economic conditions and the level of seller confidence. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had development and expansion projects at a total cost of approximately $979.6 million. Costs incurred through December 31, 2022 were $373.0 million, with the remaining cost to complete of $606.6 million expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. Some of these projects are subject to contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek to add projects to maintain and increase our robust pipeline. Our ability to do so continues to be challenged by various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage facilities in certain municipalities. \n\nProperty Operating Expenses: The direct and indirect cost of our operations impose significant cash requirements. Direct operating costs include property taxes, on-site property manager payroll, repairs and maintenance, utilities, and marketing. Indirect operating costs include supervisory payroll and centralized management costs. The cash requirements from these operating costs will vary year to year based on, among other things, changes in the size of our portfolio and changes in property tax rates and assessed values, wage rates, and marketing costs in our markets. \n\nRedemption of Preferred Securities : Historically, we have taken advantage of refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities. In the future, we may also elect to finance the redemption of preferred securities with proceeds from the issuance of debt. As of February 21, 2023, we have two series of preferred securities that are eligible for redemption, at our option and with 30 days&#8217; notice: our 5.150% Series F Preferred Shares ($280.0 million) and our 5.050% Series G Preferred Shares ($300.0 million). See Note 9 to our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements for the redemption dates of all of our series of preferred shares. Redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors, including the rate at which we could issue replacement preferred securities. None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders. \n\nRepurchases of Common Shares : Our Board has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2022, we did not repurchase any of our common shares. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 21, 2023, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. Future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures \n\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in accordance with SEC guidelines, and that such information is communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition &#8220;of disclosure controls and procedures&#8221; in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures in reaching that level of reasonable assurance. We also have investments in certain unconsolidated real estate entities, and, because we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022, at a reasonable assurance level. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the \n\nparticipation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst &#38; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst &#38; Young LLP&#8217;s report on our internal control over financial reporting appears below. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2022 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Public Storage \n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Public Storage&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Public Storage (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nLos Angeles, California \n\nFebruary 21, 2023 \n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nF-1 \n\n##TABLE_START Purchase Price Allocation Description of the Matter For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 74 self-storage facilities for a total purchase price of $730.5 million. As further discussed in Notes 2 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price was allocated based on a relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which consisted principally of land and buildings. \n\nAuditing the accounting for the Company&#8217;s 2022 acquisitions of self-storage facilities was subjective because the Company, with the assistance of its external valuation specialist, must exercise a high level of management judgment in determining the estimated fair value of acquired land and buildings. Determining the fair value of acquired land was difficult due to the lack of available directly comparable land market information. The estimated fair value of the acquired buildings was based upon (i) the income approach, which included estimating the fair value of hypothetical vacant acquired buildings and adjusting for the estimated fair value of land or (ii) estimated replacement costs, which were calculated by estimating the cost of building similar facilities in comparable markets and adjusting those costs for the age, quality, and configuration associated with the acquired facilities. Determining the fair value of the acquired buildings was challenging due to the judgment utilized by management in determining the assumptions utilized in, or the adjustments applied to, the valuation of each building. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s accounting for acquired self-storage facilities, including controls over the review of assumptions underlying the purchase price allocation and accuracy of the underlying data used. For example, we tested controls over the determination of the fair value of the land and building assets, including the controls over the review of the valuation models and the underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. \n\nFor the 2022 acquisitions of self-storage facilities described above, our procedures included, but were not limited to, evaluating the sensitivity of changes in significant assumptions on the purchase price allocation. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements resulting from changes in allocated land and building values. For certain of these asset acquisitions, we also read the purchase agreements, evaluated whether the Company had appropriately determined whether the transaction was a business combination or asset acquisition, evaluated the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. Additionally, for certain of these asset acquisitions, we involved our valuation specialists to assist in the assessment of the methodology utilized by the Company, in addition to performing corroborative analyses to assess whether the conclusions in the valuation were supported by observable market data. For example, our valuation specialists used independently identified data sources to evaluate management&#8217;s selected comparable land sales, income approach assumptions, and replacement cost assumptions. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38;

Description of the Business \n\nPublic Storage (referred to herein as &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), a Maryland real estate investment trust that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;), was organized in 1980. Our principal business activities include the ownership and operation of self-storage facilities that offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use, ancillary activities such as tenant reinsurance, merchandise sales, and third party management, as well as the acquisition and development of additional self-storage space. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had direct and indirect equity interests in 2,869 self-storage facilities (with approximately 204.2 million net rentable square feet) located in 40 states in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) operating under the Public Storage&#174; name, and 1.2 million net rentable square feet of commercial and retail space. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we owned a 35 % common equity interest in Shurgard Self Storage Limited (&#8220;Shurgard&#8221;), a public company traded on the Euronext Brussels under the &#8220;SHUR&#8221; symbol, which owned 266 self-storage facilities (with approximately 15 million net rentable square feet) located in seven Western European countries, all operating under the Shurgard&#174; name. \n\nOn July 20, 2022, in connection with the closing of the merger of PS Business Parks, Inc. (&#8220;PSB&#8221;) with affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (&#8220;Blackstone&#8221;), we completed the sale of our 41 % common equity interest in PSB in its entirety. Prior to the merger transaction, PSB was a REIT traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the &#8220;PSB&#8221; symbol, which owned commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, flex, and office space. Refer to Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities for transaction information and our accounting treatment of the sale. \n\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented on an accrual basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) as set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), and in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). \n\nDisclosures of the number and square footage of facilities, as well as the number and coverage of tenant reinsurance policies (Note 14) are unaudited and outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s audit of our financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). \n\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \n\nConsolidation and Equity Method of Accounting \n\nWe consider entities to be Variable Interest Entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) when they have insufficient equity to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by other parties, or the equity holders as a group do not have a controlling financial interest. In addition, we have general partner interests in limited partnerships along with third-party investors to develop, construct or operate self-storage facilities. As the general partner, we consider the limited partnerships to be VIEs if the limited partners lack both substantive participating rights and substantive kick-out rights. We consolidate VIEs when we have (i) the power to direct the activities most significantly impacting economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. The total assets, primarily real estate assets, and the total liabilities of our consolidated VIEs are not material as of December 31, 2022. We consolidate all other entities when we control them through voting shares or contractual rights. We refer to the entities we consolidate, for the period in which the reference applies, collectively as the &#8220;Subsidiaries,&#8221; and we eliminate intercompany transactions and balances. \n\nF-10 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nWe account for our investments in entities that we do not consolidate but over which we have significant influence using the equity method of accounting. We refer to these entities, for the periods in which the reference applies, collectively as the &#8220;Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities,&#8221; and we eliminate intra-entity profits and losses and amortize any differences between the cost of our investment and the underlying equity in net assets against equity in earnings as if the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entity were a consolidated subsidiary. \n\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities presented on our income statements represents our pro-rata share of the earnings of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities. The dividends we receive from the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities are reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows as &#8220;distributions from cumulative equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities&#8221; to the extent of our cumulative equity in earnings, with any excess classified as &#8220;distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from unconsolidated real estate entities.&#8221; \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. \n\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \n\nCash equivalents represent highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three months of acquisition such as money market funds with a rating of at least AAA by Standard &#38; Poor's, commercial paper that is rated A1 by Standard &#38; Poor's or deposits with highly rated commercial banks. Restricted cash, which represent amounts used to collateralize our insurance obligations and are restricted from general corporate use, are included in other assets. \n\nFair Value \n\nAs used herein, the term &#8220;fair value&#8221; is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the balance sheet date. \n\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value: \n\nLevel 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. \n\nLevel 2 Significant observable inputs other than Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data. \n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data for the related assets or liabilities. \n\nThe categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nOur financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other assets, other liabilities, and notes payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, other assets and other liabilities are stated at book value, which approximates fair value as of the balance sheet date due to the short time period to maturity. \n\nWe estimate and disclose the fair value of our notes payable using Level 2 inputs by discounting the related future cash flows at a rate based upon quoted interest rates for securities that have similar characteristics such as credit quality and time to maturity. \n\nF-11 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nWe use significant judgment to estimate fair values of real estate facilities, goodwill, and other intangible assets for the purposes of purchase price allocation or impairment analysis. In estimating their values, we consider Level 3 inputs such as market prices of land, market capitalization rates, expected returns, earnings multiples, projected levels of earnings, costs of construction, and functional depreciation. \n\nReal Estate Facilities \n\nWe record real estate facilities at cost. We capitalize all costs incurred to acquire, develop, construct, renovate and improve facilities as part of major repair and maintenance programs, including interest and property taxes incurred during the construction period. We expense the costs of demolition of existing facilities associated with a renovation as incurred. We allocate the net acquisition cost of acquired real estate facilities to the underlying land, buildings, and identified intangible assets based upon their respective individual estimated fair values. \n\nWe expense costs associated with dispositions of real estate, as well as routine repairs and maintenance costs, as incurred. We depreciate buildings and improvements on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging generally between 5 to 25 years. \n\nWhen we sell a full or partial interest in a real estate facility without retaining a controlling interest following sale, we recognize a gain or loss on sale as if 100 % of the property was sold at fair value. If we retain a controlling interest following the sale, we record a noncontrolling interest for the book value of the partial interest sold, and recognize additional paid-in capital for the difference between the consideration received and the partial interest at book value. \n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \n\nIntangible assets consist of goodwill, the Shurgard&#174; trade name, which Shurgard uses pursuant to a fee-based licensing agreement, and finite-lived assets. Goodwill and the Shurgard&#174; trade name have indefinite lives and are not amortized. Our finite-lived assets consist primarily of (i) acquired customers in place amortized relative to the benefit of the customers in place, with such amortization reflected as depreciation and amortization expense on our income statement and (ii) property tax abatements acquired and amortized relative to the reduction in property tax paid, with such amortization reflected as self-storage cost of operations on our income statement. \n\nEvaluation of Asset Impairment \n\nWe evaluate our real estate and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter. If there are indicators of impairment and we determine that the asset is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows to be received through the asset&#8217;s remaining life (or, if earlier, the expected disposal date), we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s estimated fair value or net proceeds from expected disposal. \n\nWe evaluate our investments in unconsolidated real estate entities for impairment quarterly. We record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds estimated fair value, when we believe any such shortfall is other than temporary. \n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever relevant events, circumstances, and other related factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the related reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. When we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the aggregate carrying amount, no impairment charge is recorded and no further analysis is performed. Otherwise, we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the amount that would be allocated to goodwill if the reporting unit were acquired for estimated fair value. \n\nWe evaluate other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Shurgard&#174; trade name for impairment at least annually and whenever relevant events, circumstances and other related factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. When we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we do not record an impairment charge and no further analysis is performed. Otherwise, we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the asset&#8217;s estimated fair value. \n\nF-12 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nNo impairments were recorded in any of our evaluations for any period presented herein. \n\nRevenue and Expense Recognition \n\nWe recognize revenues from self-storage facilities, which primarily comprise rental income earned pursuant to month-to-month leases, as well as associated late charges and administrative fees, as earned. Promotional discounts reduce rental income over the promotional period, which is generally one month. We recognize ancillary revenues when earned. \n\nWe accrue for property tax expense based upon actual amounts billed and, in some circumstances, estimates when bills or assessments have not been received from the taxing authorities. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing and amount of expense recognition could be incorrect. We expense cost of operations (including advertising expenditures), general and administrative expense, and interest expense as incurred. \n\nForeign Currency Exchange Translation \n\nThe local currency (primarily the Euro) is the functional currency for our interests in foreign operations. The related balance sheet amounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates at the respective financial statement date, while amounts on our consolidated statements of income are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective period. Cumulative translation adjustments, to the extent not included in cumulative net income, are included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nWhen financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar are expected to be settled in cash in the foreseeable future, the impact of changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent are reflected in current earnings. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, due primarily to our investment in Shurgard (Note 4) and our notes payable denominated in Euros (Note 7), our operating results and financial position are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the Euro, and to a lesser extent, other European currencies, against the U.S. Dollar. The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.070 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2022 ( 1.134 at December 31, 2021), and average exchange rates of 1.054 , 1.183 and 1.141 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have met these REIT requirements for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, we have recorded no U.S. federal corporate income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income. \n\nOur tenant reinsurance, merchandise, and third party management operations are subject to corporate income tax and such taxes are included in general and administrative expenses. We also incur income and other taxes in certain states, which are included in general and administrative expense. \n\nWe recognize tax benefits of uncertain income tax positions that are subject to audit only if we believe it is more likely than not that the position would ultimately be sustained assuming the relevant taxing authorities had full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances of our positions. As of December 31, 2022, we had no tax benefits that were not recognized. \n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\nWe generally estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of restricted share units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) with no market conditions based on the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common shares on the date of grant. We value stock options with no market conditions at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We value stock options and RSUs with market conditions at the grant \n\nF-13 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\ndate using a Monte-Carlo valuation simulation. Our determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model or Monte-Carlo valuation simulation is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective and complex variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards. For stock options, variables also include actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors. For restricted share units and stock options with performance conditions, we adjust compensation cost each quarter as needed for any changes in the assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved. \n\nWe amortize the grant-date fair value of awards as compensation expense over the service period, which begins on the grant date and ends on the expected vesting date. For awards that are earned solely upon the passage of time and continued service, the entire cost of the award is amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period. For awards with market and/or performance conditions, the individual cost of each vesting is amortized separately over each individual service period (the &#8220;accelerated attribution&#8221; method). For awards with performance conditions, the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. In amortizing share-based compensation expense, we do not estimate future forfeitures. Instead, we reverse previously amortized share-based compensation expense with respect to grants that are forfeited in the period the employee terminates employment. \n\nIn July 2020, we modified our share-based compensation plans to allow immediate vesting upon retirement (&#8220;Retirement Acceleration&#8221;), and to extend the exercisability of outstanding stock options up to a year after retirement, for currently outstanding and future grants. Prior to the modification, unvested awards were forfeited, and outstanding vested stock options were cancelled, upon retirement. Employees are eligible for Retirement Acceleration if they meet certain conditions including length of service, age, notice of intent to retire, and facilitation of succession for their role. This modification results in accelerating amortization of compensation expense for each grant by changing the end of the service period from the original vesting date to the date an employee is expected to be eligible for Retirement Acceleration, if earlier. \n\nF-14 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n3.

Approximately $ 24.1 million of the total cost was allocated to intangible assets. We completed development and redevelopment activities costing $ 227.2 million during 2022, adding 1.4 million net rentable square feet of self-storage space. Construction in process at December 31, 2022 consisted of projects to develop new self-storage facilities and expand existing self-storage facilities.

On July 20, 2022, PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $ 187.50 per share or unit, including a $ 5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit, and a $ 0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit, for a total of $ 187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction, we received a total of $ 2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $ 2.1 billion, which was classified within gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nWe classified $ 2.6 billion of the proceeds from the merger consideration, or $ 182.25 per share or unit within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2022. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received cash distributions from PSB totaling $ 109.5 million (including the aforementioned $ 5.25 closing cash dividend per share or unit and the $ 0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit from the merger transaction), $ 127.3 million and $ 60.7 million, respectively, which were classified within cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nInvestment in Shurgard \n\nThroughout all periods presented, we effectively owned, directly and indirectly 31,268,459 Shurgard common shares, representing a 35 % equity interest in Shurgard. \n\nBased upon the closing price at December 31, 2022 (&#8364; 42.85 per share of Shurgard common stock, at 1.070 exchange rate of U.S. Dollars to the Euro), the shares we owned had a market value of approximately $ 1.4 billion. \n\nF-17 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nOur equity in earnings of Shurgard comprised our equity share of Shurgard&#8217;s net income, less amortization of the Shurgard Basis Differential (defined below). During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received $ 3.5 million, $ 3.5 million and $ 3.1 million of trademark license fees that Shurgard pays to us for the use of the Shurgard&#174; trademark, respectively. We eliminated $ 1.2 million, $ 1.2 million, and $ 1.1 million of intra-entity profits and losses for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing our equity share of the trademark license fees.

Approximately $ 13.7 million, $ 19.5 million and $ 24.7 million of total cash distributions from Shurgard during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, represented distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from Shurgard, which was classified within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, our investment in Shurgard&#8217;s real estate assets exceeded our pro-rata share of the underlying amounts on Shurgard&#8217;s balance sheet by approximately $ 67.8 million ($ 74.7 million at December 31, 2021). This differential (the &#8220;Shurgard Basis Differential&#8221;) includes our basis adjustments in Shurgard&#8217;s real estate assets net of related deferred income taxes. The Shurgard Basis Differential is being amortized as a reduction to equity in earnings of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities. Such amortization totaled approximately $ 6.9 million, $ 8.4 million and $ 5.8 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nShurgard is a publicly held entity trading on Euronext Brussels under the symbol &#8220;SHUR&#8221;. \n\n5.

Included in these covenants are (a) a maximum Debt to Total Assets of 65 % (approximately 14 % at December 31, 2022) and (b) a minimum ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense of 1.5 x (approximately 25 x for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022) as well as covenants limiting the amount we can encumber our properties with mortgage debt. \n\nEuro Denominated Unsecured Notes \n\nOur Euro denominated unsecured notes (the &#8220;Euro Notes&#8221;) consist of four tranches: (i) &#8364; 242.0 million issued to institutional investors on November 3, 2015, (ii) &#8364; 100.0 million issued to institutional investors on April 12, 2016, (iii) &#8364; 500.0 million issued in a public offering on January 24, 2020, and (iv) &#8364; 700.0 million issued in a public offering on September 9, 2021. Interest is payable semi-annually on the notes issued November 3, 2015 and April 12, 2016, and annually on the notes issued January 24, 2020 and September 9, 2021.The Euro Notes have financial covenants similar to those of the U.S. Dollar Denominated Unsecured Notes. \n\nWe reflect changes in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the amount payable including the associated interest, as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates as &#8220;Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)&#8221; on our income statement (gains of $ 99.2 million for 2022, as compared to gains of $ 111.8 million for 2021 and losses of $ 98.0 million for 2020). \n\nMortgage Notes \n\nWe assumed our non-recourse mortgage debt in connection with property acquisitions, and we recorded such debt at fair value with any premium or discount to the stated note balance amortized using the effective interest method. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, the related contractual interest rates of our mortgage notes are fixed, ranging between 3.2 % and 7.1 %, and mature between November 1, 2023 and July 1, 2030. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, approximate principal maturities of our Notes Payable are as follows (amounts in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Unsecured Debt Mortgage Debt Total 2023 $ &#8212; $ 8,270 $ 8,270 2024 807,035 124 807,159 2025 259,039 131 259,170 2026 1,150,000 138 1,150,138 2027 500,000 140 500,140 Thereafter 4,184,420 1,289 4,185,709 $ 6,900,494 $ 10,092 $ 6,910,586 Weighted average effective rate 2.0 % 3.4 % 2.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\nCash paid for interest totaled $ 133.8 million, $ 77.7 million, and $ 52.7 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Interest capitalized as real estate totaled $ 6.0 million, $ 3.5 million and $ 3.4 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\n8. Noncontrolling Interests \n\nThere are noncontrolling interests related to several subsidiaries we consolidate of which we do not own 100% of the equity. At December 31, 2022, certain of these subsidiaries have issued 499,966 partnership units to third-parties that are convertible on a one -for-one basis (subject to certain limitations) into common shares of the Company at the request of the unitholder. These include a total of 54,137 partnership units of $ 19.9 million issued to third-parties in connection with our acquisition of self-storage properties in 2022. \n\nF-21 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nAt March 31, 2022, there were 254,833 partnership units of $ 83.8 million classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of total equity in our consolidated balance sheets, because the unitholders of these partnership units had the right to require redemption of their partnership units in cash if common shares of the Company were not publicly listed. In the second quarter of 2022, the related partnership agreements were amended with such cash redemption feature removed from these partnership units. We therefore reclassified $ 83.8 million from redeemable noncontrolling interests to noncontrolling interests in total equity during the three months ended June 30, 2022. \n\n9.

Except as noted below, holders of the Preferred Shares do not have voting rights. In the event of a cumulative arrearage equal to six quarterly dividends, holders of all outstanding series of preferred shares (voting as a single class without regard to series) will have the right to elect two additional members to serve on our Board of Trustees (our &#8220;Board&#8221;) until the arrearage has been cured. At December 31, 2022, there were no dividends in arrears. The affirmative vote of at least 66.67 % of the outstanding shares of a series of Preferred Shares is required for any material and adverse amendment to the terms of such series. The affirmative vote of at least 66.67 % of the outstanding shares of all of our Preferred Shares, voting as a single class, is required to issue shares ranking senior to our Preferred Shares. \n\nExcept under certain conditions relating to the Company&#8217;s qualification as a REIT, the Preferred Shares are not redeemable prior to the dates indicated on the table above. On or after the respective dates, each of the series of Preferred Shares is redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at $ 25.00 per depositary share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Holders of the Preferred Shares cannot require us to redeem such shares. \n\nF-22 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nUpon issuance of our Preferred Shares, we classify the liquidation value as preferred equity on our consolidated balance sheet with any issuance costs recorded as a reduction to Paid-in capital. \n\nDuring 2022, 2021, and 2020, we issued the following series of Preferred Shares at an issuance price of $ 25.00 per depository share with each depository share representing 0.001 of a share of Preferred Share (amounts in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Series Shares Gross Proceeds Issuance Costs 2022 S 10,000 &#160; $ 250,000 &#160; $ 7,168 &#160; 2021 P, Q and R 47,300 &#160; 1,182,500 &#160; 35,045 &#160; 2020 L, M, N and O 49,900 &#160; 1,247,500 &#160; 39,294 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we redeemed the following series of Preferred Shares at par (none in 2022) (amounts in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Series Aggregate Redemption Amount Allocation of Income to Preferred Shares Holders in Connection with Redemption \n\n2021 C, D and E $ 875,000 &#160; $ 28,914 &#160; 2020 (a) V, W, X and B 1,520,000 &#160; 48,265 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) On December 14, 2020, we called for redemption of, and on January 20, 2021, we redeemed Series B Preferred Shares.

Through December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 23.7 million shares pursuant to this authorization; none of which were repurchased during the three years ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThe unaudited characterization of dividends for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes is made based upon earnings and profits of the Company, as defined by the Code. Common share dividends paid, including amounts paid to our restricted share unitholders, totaled $ 3.714 billion ($ 21.15 per share), $ 1.402 billion ($ 8.00 per share), and $ 1.399 billion ($ 8.00 per share) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Included in common share dividends paid during 2022 is $ 2.3 billion of a special cash dividend (&#8220;Special Dividend&#8221;) of $ 13.15 per common share paid on August 4, 2022 in connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB on July 20, 2022.

Related Party Transactions \n\nAt December 31, 2022, Tamara Hughes Gustavson, a current member of our Board, held less than a 0.1 % equity interest in, and is a manager of, a limited liability company that owns 65 self-storage facilities in Canada. Two of Ms. Gustavson&#8217;s adult children owned the remaining equity interest in the limited liability company. These facilities operate under the Public Storage&#174; tradename, which we license to the owners of these facilities for use in Canada on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis. We have no ownership interest in these facilities and we do not own or operate any facilities in Canada. If we chose to acquire or develop our own facilities in Canada, we would have to share the use of the Public Storage&#174; name in Canada. We have a right of first refusal, subject to limitations, to acquire the stock or assets of the corporation engaged in the operation of these facilities if their owners agree to sell them. Our subsidiaries reinsure risks relating to loss of goods stored by customers in these facilities, and have received premium payments of approximately $ 2.2 million, $ 2.1 million and $ 1.6 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nOn July 8, 2022, we acquired from PSB the commercial interests in five properties at three sites jointly occupied with certain of our self-storage facilities located in Maryland and Virginia, for $ 47.3 million. We recognized $ 27.0 million of real estate assets and $ 0.7 million of intangibles for the properties acquired, representing the cost of these commercial properties that we did not have interest in through our equity investment in PSB. We recognized the remaining $ 19.6 million as an increase in our basis in our equity investment in PSB, which represents the elimination of our portion of the gain recorded by PSB. \n\n11. Share-Based Compensation \n\nUnder various share-based compensation plans and under terms established or modified by our Board or a committee thereof, we grant equity awards to trustees, officers, and key employees, including non-qualified options to purchase the Company&#8217;s common shares, RSUs, deferred share units (&#8220;DSUs&#8221;), and unrestricted common shares issued in lieu of trustee compensation. \n\nOn April 26, 2021, the Company&#8217;s Shareholders approved the 2021 Equity and Performance-Based Incentive Compensation Plan (&#8220;2021 Plan&#8221;), which authorized an additional three million shares available for future issuance of equity-based awards. As of December 31, 2022, there were a total of 1,724,352 shares reserved for granting of future options and stock awards under the 2021 Plan. \n\nWe recorded share-based compensation expense associated with our equity awards in the various expense categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income as set forth in the following table. In addition, $ 4.1 million and $ 3.9 million share-based compensation cost was capitalized as real estate facilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively ( none in 2020). \n\nF-24 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n##TABLE_START For Years Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2021 2020 &#160; (Amounts in thousands) Self-storage cost of operations $ 17,950 &#160; $ 20,544 &#160; $ 14,904 &#160; Ancillary cost of operations 888 &#160; 1,561 &#160; &#8212; &#160; General and administrative 37,865 &#160; 37,760 &#160; 18,586 &#160; Total $ 56,703 &#160; $ 59,865 &#160; $ 33,490 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIncluded in share-based compensation is $ 14.9 million, $ 15.9 million and $ 5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, of retirement acceleration as discussed in Note 2. \n\nStock Options \n\nWe have service-based and performance-based stock options outstanding. Performance-based stock options outstanding vest upon meeting certain performance conditions or market conditions. Stock options generally vest over 3 to 5 years, expire 10 years after the grant date, and have an exercise price equal to the closing trading price of our common shares on the grant date. New shares are issued for options exercised. Employees cannot require the Company to settle their award in cash. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred share-based compensation cost for outstanding stock options of $ 19.9 million, $ 25.1 million and $ 7.6 million, respectively. \n\nDuring 2022, we granted 65,000 stock options in connection with non-management trustee compensation. We also granted 77,683 stock options, of which vesting is dependent upon meeting certain market conditions over the three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, with continued service-based vesting through the first quarter of 2027. These stock options require relative achievement of the Company&#8217;s total shareholder return as compared to the weighted average total shareholder return of specified peer groups and can result in grantees earning up to 200 % of the target options originally granted. \n\nDuring 2021, 245,000 stock options were awarded where vesting is dependent upon meeting certain performance targets over the three-year period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023, which are considered performance conditions, with continued service-based vesting through the first quarter of 2026. These awards contain a relative Total Shareholder Return modifier that will adjust the payout based on relative performance as compared to the market. As of December 31, 2022, these performance targets were expected to be met at 125 % achievement, an increase from 100 % as of December 31, 2021. \n\nDuring 2020, 770,000 stock options were awarded where vesting is dependent upon meeting certain performance targets over the three-year period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022, which are considered performance conditions, with continued service-based vesting through the first quarter of 2025. These performance targets were met at 125 % achievement at December 31, 2022. \n\nThe stock options outstanding at December 31, 2022 have an aggregate intrinsic value (the excess, if any, of each option&#8217;s market value over the exercise price) of approximately $ 209.8 million and remaining average contractual lives of approximately five years . Total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options that has not yet been recognized is $ 21.2 million and is expected to be recognized as compensation cost over approximately three years on average. Exercisable stock options have an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $ 128.9 million at December 31, 2022 and remaining average contractual lives of approximately three years . \n\nAdditional information with respect to stock options during 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows: \n\nF-25 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n##TABLE_START Service-Based Performance-Based Total Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share \n\nOptions outstanding January 1, 2020 \n\n2,339,667 &#160; $ 204.53 &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; 2,339,667 &#160; $ 204.53 &#160; Granted 70,000 &#160; 200.61 &#160; 770,000 &#160; 228.94 &#160; 840,000 &#160; 226.58 &#160; Exercised ( 71,500 ) ( 175.16 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 71,500 ) ( 175.16 ) Cancelled ( 107,000 ) ( 220.33 ) ( 40,000 ) ( 228.94 ) ( 147,000 ) ( 222.67 ) \n\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2020 \n\n2,231,167 &#160; $ 204.60 &#160; 730,000 &#160; $ 228.94 &#160; 2,961,167 &#160; $ 210.59 &#160; Granted (a) 140,000 &#160; 248.54 &#160; 420,000 &#160; 229.53 &#160; 560,000 &#160; 234.29 &#160; Exercised ( 471,216 ) ( 203.30 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 471,216 ) ( 203.30 ) Cancelled &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 10,000 ) ( 228.94 ) ( 10,000 ) ( 228.94 ) \n\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2021 \n\n1,899,951 &#160; $ 208.16 &#160; 1,140,000 &#160; $ 229.16 &#160; 3,039,951 &#160; $ 216.04 &#160; Granted (b) 65,000 &#160; 398.97 &#160; 138,933 &#160; 299.88 &#160; 203,933 &#160; 331.46 &#160; Special dividend adjustment (c) 62,512 &#160; N/A 41,836 &#160; N/A 104,348 &#160; N/A Exercised ( 173,422 ) ( 189.95 ) ( 10,327 ) ( 221.68 ) ( 183,749 ) ( 191.74 ) Cancelled &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2022 (d) \n\n1,854,041 &#160; $ 209.53 &#160; 1,310,442 &#160; $ 229.39 &#160; 3,164,483 &#160; $ 217.75 &#160; \n\nOptions exercisable at December 31, 2022 (d) \n\n1,617,555 &#160; $ 200.87 &#160; 10,327 &#160; $ 221.68 &#160; 1,627,882 &#160; $ 201.00 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Aggregate exercise date intrinsic value of options exercised during the year (in 000's) $ 27,210 $ 44,613 $ 3,433 Average assumptions used in valuing options with the Black-Scholes method: Expected life of options in years 6 5 5 Risk-free interest rate 2.9 % 0.8 % 0.4 % Expected volatility, based upon historical volatility 22.9 % 24.1 % 21.6 % Expected dividend yield 2.0 % 2.9 % 3.8 % Average assumptions used in valuing options with market conditions with the Monte-Carlo simulation method: Expected life of options in years 7 5 Risk-free interest rate 1.8 % 0.9 % Expected volatility, based upon historical volatility 22.6 % 26.5 % Expected dividend yield 2.3 % 2.9 % Average estimated value of options granted during the year $ 87.57 $ 62.66 $ 17.79 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Amount granted for performance-based stock options includes performance adjustments above target for options granted in 2020. \n\n(b) Amount granted for performance-based stock options includes performance adjustments above target for options granted in 2021. \n\n(c) On August 4, 2022, we paid a Special Dividend of $ 13.15 per common share to shareholders of record as of August 1, 2022. Stock options that were outstanding at the time of the Special Dividend were adjusted pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of the Company&#8217;s applicable equity and performance-based incentive compensation plans that provide for equitable adjustments in the event of an extraordinary cash dividend. The anti-dilution adjustments \n\nF-26 \n\nPUBLIC STORAGE \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nproportionately increased the number of outstanding stock options and reduced the exercise prices of outstanding stock options by a conversion rate of 1.03275 , resulting in an increase of 104,348 stock options outstanding. The adjustments did not result in incremental share-based compensation expense. \n\n(d) The weighted average exercise price of options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2022 reflect the adjusted exercise price post the anti-dilution adjustment on August 3, 2022. \n\nRestricted Share Units \n\nWe have service-based and performance-based RSUs outstanding, which generally vest over 5 to 8 years from the grant date. Performance-based RSUs outstanding vest upon meeting certain performance conditions or market conditions. The grantee receives dividends for each outstanding RSU equal to the per-share dividends received by our common shareholders. We expense any dividends previously paid upon forfeiture of the related RSU. Upon vesting, the grantee receives new common shares equal to the number of vested RSUs, less common shares withheld to satisfy the grantee&#8217;s statutory tax liabilities arising from the vesting. \n\nThe fair value of our RSUs is determined based upon the applicable closing trading price of our common shares. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred share-based compensation cost for RSUs of $ 39.9 million, $ 37.6 million, and $ 25.1 million, respectively. \n\nDuring 2022, 21,985 RSUs were awarded where vesting is dependent upon meeting certain market conditions over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, with continued service-based vesting through the first quarter of 2027. The amount of these RSUs that are earned and vested, if any, will be based, in addition to continued employment requirements, on the Company's relative total shareholder return over the three-year period as compared to the weighted average total shareholder return of the specified peer groups and can result in grantees earning up to 200 % of the target RSUs originally granted. \n\nDuring 2021, 37,000 RSUs were awarded where vesting is dependent upon meeting certain performance targets for 2021, which are considered performance conditions, with continued service-based vesting through the first quarter of 2026. As of December 31, 2021, these targets were met at 125 % achievement. \n\nRemaining compensation cost related to RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2022 totals approximately $ 74.3 million and is expected to be recognized over the next two years on average.

Commitments and Contingencies \n\nContingent Losses \n\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings and subject to various claims and complaints; however, we believe that the likelihood of these contingencies resulting in a material loss to the Company, either individually or in the aggregate, is remote. \n\nInsurance and Loss Exposure \n\nWe carry property, earthquake, general liability, employee medical insurance, and workers compensation coverage through internationally recognized insurance carriers, subject to deductibles. Our deductible for general liability is $ 2.0 million per occurrence. Our annual deductible for property loss is $ 25.0 million per occurrence. This deductible decreases to $ 5.0 million once we reach $ 35.0 million in aggregate losses for occurrences that exceed $ 5.0 million. Insurance carriers&#8217; aggregate limits on these policies of $ 75.0 million for property losses and $ 102.0 million for general liability losses are higher than estimates of maximum probable losses that could occur from individual catastrophic events determined in recent engineering and actuarial studies; however, in case of multiple catastrophic events, these limits could be exceeded. \n\nWe reinsure a program that provides insurance to our customers from an independent third-party insurer. This program covers customer claims for losses to goods stored at our facilities as a result of specific named perils (earthquakes are not covered by this program), up to a maximum limit of $ 5,000 per storage unit. We reinsure all risks in this program, but purchase insurance to cover this exposure for a limit of $ 15.0 million for losses in excess of $ 5.0 million per occurrence. We are subject to licensing requirements and regulations in all states. Customers participate in the program at their option. At December 31, 2022, there were approximately 1.2 million certificates held by our self-storage customers, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $ 5.6 billion. \n\nCommitments \n\nWe have construction commitments representing future expected payments for construction under contract totaling $ 263.5 million at December 31, 2022. We expect to pay approximately $ 229.8 million in 2023 and $ 33.7 million in 2024 for these construction commitments. \n\nWe have future contractual payments on land, equipment and office space under various lease commitments totaling $ 63.4 million at December 31, 2022. We expect to pay approximately $ 3.1 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $ 3.0 million in each of 2025 and 2026, $ 2.1 million in 2027 and $ 49.1 million thereafter for these commitments. \n\n15.
