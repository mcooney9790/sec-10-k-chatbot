Business\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We have a significant ownership interest in the co-investment ventures, which are either consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity.\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#8220;Internal Revenue Code&#8221; or &#8220;IRC&#8221;). We believe the current organization and method of operation enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Prologis, L.P. was also formed in 1997.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe operate, manage and measure the operating performance of our properties on an owned and managed (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) basis. Our O&#38;M portfolio includes our consolidated properties as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We make operating decisions based on our total O&#38;M portfolio as we manage the properties without regard to their ownership. We also evaluate our results based on our proportionate economic ownership of each property included in the O&#38;M portfolio (&#8220;our share&#8221;) to reflect our share of the financial results of the O&#38;M portfolio.\n\n&#160;\n\nIncluded in our discussion below are references to funds from operations (&#8220;FFO&#8221;) and net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;), neither of which are United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of Net Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders in the Consolidated Statements of Income to our FFO measures and a reconciliation of NOI to Operating Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur corporate headquarters is located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, Denver, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Internet address is www.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the ticker &#8220;PLD&#8221; and is a component of the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (&#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) 500.\n\n&#160;\n\nTHE COMPANY\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 19 countries across four continents. Our portfolio focuses on the world&#8217;s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale across these locations allows us to better serve our customers&#8217; diverse logistics requirements. Our teams actively manage our portfolio and provide comprehensive real estate services, including leasing, property management, development, acquisitions and dispositions. We invest significant capital into new logistics properties principally through our \n\n&#160;\n\ndevelopment activity and third-party acquisitions. The contribution of newly developed properties to our co-investment ventures and the sale of non-strategic properties to third parties allow s us to recycle capital into our development and acquisition activities. \n\n&#160;\n\nWhile the majority of our properties in the U.S. are wholly owned, we hold a significant ownership interest in properties internationally and in the U.S. through our investments in the co-investment ventures. Partnering with the world&#8217;s largest institutional investors through co-investment ventures allows us to enhance and diversify our real estate returns as well as mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.\n\n&#160;\n\nLogistics supply chains have increased dramatically in importance to our customers and the global economy. The long-term trends of e-commerce adoption and supply chain resiliency continue to drive the need for increased warehouse space to store and distribute goods. This demand has translated into meaningful increases in rents and low vacancy. We believe this demand is driven by three primary factors: (i) customer supply chains re-positioning to address the significant shift to e-commerce and heightened service expectations&#59; (ii) overall consumption and household growth&#59; and (iii) our customers&#8217; desire for more supply chain resiliency. We believe these forces will keep demand strong for the long-term.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe nature of the services we are providing to our customers is expanding. The scale of our 1.2 billion square foot portfolio allows us to provide a platform of solutions to address challenges that companies face in global fulfillment today. Through Prologis Essentials, we focus on innovative ways to meet our customers&#8217; operations, energy and sustainability, mobility and workforce needs. Our customer experience teams, proprietary technology and strategic partnerships are foundational to Prologis Essentials and allow us to provide our customers with unique and actionable insights to drive greater efficiency in their operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur long-standing dedication to Environmental, Social and Governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) practices strengthens our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business. The principles of ESG are an important aspect of our business strategy that we believe delivers a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. \n\n&#160;\n\n2022 Significant Acquisition \n\n&#160;\n\nOn October 3, 2022, we acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively &#8220;Duke&#8221;) through a merger transaction that we refer to as the &#8220;Duke Transaction&#8221; and is detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Our financial condition and operating results include the Duke properties subsequent to the acquisition date. The Duke portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 494 industrial operating properties, aggregating 144 million square feet and was highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. There was approximately 15 million square feet of non-strategic industrial operating properties that we do not intend to hold long-term and are classified as other real estate investments. The portfolio also included properties under development, land for future development and investments in other ventures. The acquisition expanded our presence in target markets such as Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, South Florida and Southern California. The total acquisition price, including transaction costs, was $23.2 billion and was funded through the issuance of equity based on the value of the Prologis, Inc. common stock issued using the closing price on September 30, 2022 and the assumption of debt. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategy and our ability to scale, we integrated the Duke portfolio while adding minimal property management and general and administrative expenses (&#8220;G&#38;A&#8221;).\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOverview\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we owned or had investments in, on a wholly-owned basis or through co-investment ventures, properties and development projects expected to total approximately 1.2 billion square feet across the following geographies: \n\nThroughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments.\n\n&#160;\n\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital.\n\n&#160;\n\nBelow is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nNOI from the Real Estate Segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Rental Revenues and Development Management and Other Revenues less Rental Expenses and Other Expenses. NOI from the Strategic Capital Segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nA developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of when a property that was developed has been completed for one year, is contributed to a co-investment venture following completion or is 90% occupied. Amounts represent our total expected investment (&#8220;TEI&#8221;) upon stabilization, which includes the estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, construction and leasing costs. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReal Estate Segment\n\n&#160;\n\nRental Operations. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. For leases that commenced during 2022 within the consolidated operating portfolio, the weighted average lease term was 69 months. We expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth, outside of the Duke Transaction, will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents when leases expire, as discussed further below. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. Substantially all of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows from rental operations are generated in the U.S. \n\n&#160;\n\nDevelopment. Given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets, our development business provides the opportunity to build to the requirements of our current and future customers while deepening our market presence. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our global land bank and redevelopment sites&#59; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams&#59; (iii) the depth of our customer relationships&#59; (iv) our ability to integrate sustainable design features that result in cost-savings and operational efficiencies for our customers&#59; and (v) our procurement capabilities that allow us to secure high-demand construction materials at lower cost. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the value of our Real Estate Segment. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. \n\n&#160;\n\nStrategic Capital Segment\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Strategic Capital Segment allows us to partner with many of the world&#8217;s largest institutional investors. The business is capitalized principally through private and public equity of which 95% is either in perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures, and two publicly traded vehicles (Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico). We align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our eight unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15% to 50%). This structure allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S.\n\n&#160;\n\nThis segment produces durable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% to 15% of our recurring consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO, all while requiring minimal capital other than our investment in the venture. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset management and property management services. Asset management fees are primarily driven by the quarterly valuation of the real estate properties owned by the respective ventures. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction management, development and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (&#8220;promotes&#8221; or &#8220;promote revenues&#8221;) periodically during the life of a venture, upon liquidation of a venture or upon stabilization of individual venture assets based primarily on the total return of the investments over certain financial hurdles . We plan to grow this business and increase revenues by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. The majority of strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S.\n\n&#160;\n\nFUTURE GROWTH\n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe that the quality and scale of our portfolio, our ability to build out our land bank, our strategic capital business, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet are differentiators that allow us to drive growth in revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nRent Growth. We expect rents in our markets to continue to increase due to healthy demand combined with low vacancy. Due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential to drive future organic NOI growth. We estimate that our lease mark-to-market is approximately 67% (on a net effective basis), which represents the growth rate from in-place rents to current market rents based on our share of the O&#38;M portfolio at December 31, 2022. Therefore, even if there was no additional market rent growth in the future, we expect our lease renewals to translate into significant increases in future income. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent (&#8220;NER&#8221;) of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) in every quarter since 2013. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nValue Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program requires sourcing well-located land and redevelopment sites through acquisition opportunities, including our innovative approach with Covered Land Plays, which are income producing assets acquired with the intention to redevelop for higher and better use as industrial properties. Our investment in the development portfolio was $4.2 billion at December 31, 2022. We believe that the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land, including options and Covered Land Plays, has the potential to support the development of $34.2 billion ($39.0 billion on an O&#38;M basis) of TEI of new logistics space. The global nature of our development program provides a wide landscape of opportunities to pursue based on our judgement of market conditions, opportunities and risks. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe expect to create value as we build new properties. We measure the estimated value creation of a development project as the stabilized value above our TEI. As properties are completed and leased, we expect to realize the value creation principally through gains realized through contributions of these properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of the consolidated portfolio.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStrategic Capital Advantages. We raise capital to support the long-term growth of the co-investment ventures while maintaining our own substantial investments in these vehicles. At December 31, 2022, the gross book value of the operating portfolio held by our eight unconsolidated co-investment ventures was $49.3 billion across 488 million square feet. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nG&#38;A Expenses is a line item in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted G&#38;A expenses is calculated from our Consolidated Financial Statements as G&#38;A Expenses and Strategic Capital Expenses , less expenses under the Prologis Promote Plan (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by the ventures . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nBalance Sheet Strength. The Duke Transaction increased the strength and size of our balance sheet while allowing us to maintain our low leverage. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining maturity of our consolidated debt was 9 years and the weighted average interest rate was 2.5%, primarily as a result of our refinancing activities over the last several years. Through our refinancing activities we have substantially addressed all our debt maturities until 2026 and have taken advantage of previously low interest rates. At December 31, 2022, we had total available liquidity of $4.1 billion. We continue to maintain low leverage as a percentage of our real estate investments and our market capitalization. As a result of our low leverage, available liquidity and investment capacity in the co-investment ventures, we have significant capacity to capitalize on opportunistic value-added investments as they arise. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nEconomies of Scale from Growth. We have scalable systems and infrastructure in place to grow both our consolidated and O&#38;M portfolios with limited incremental G&#38;A expense. We use adjusted G&#38;A expenses as a percentage of the O&#38;M portfolio (based on gross book value) to measure and evaluate our overhead costs. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive development and acquisition activity while further reducing G&#38;A as a percentage of our investments in real estate. The acquisition of the Duke portfolio in 2022 is a key example of this, where we increased our O&#38;M portfolio by over 20% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and had minimal increases to G&#38;A expenses , resulting in lower G&#38;A expenses as a percentage of investments in real estate. While we plan to make future investments in our new lines of business through Prologis Essentials, we expect to maintain our operational efficiency. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStaying &#8220;Ahead of What&#8217;s Next&#8482;&#8221;. We are focused on creating value beyond real estate by enhancing our customers&#8217; experience, leveraging our scale to obtain procurement savings and innovating through data analytics and digitization efforts. This includes investments in early and growth-stage companies that are focused on emerging technology. Through Prologis Essentials we support our customers through service and product offerings, including innovative solutions to operations, energy and sustainability, mobility and workforce that can make our customers&#8217; decision process easier and their enterprise more efficient. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nCompetition \n\n&#160;\n\nReal estate ownership is highly fragmented, and we face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including regional, national and global operators and developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.\n\n&#160;\n\nDespite the competition, our global reach and local market knowledge over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages, including the following:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na portfolio of properties strategically located in markets characterized by large population densities, growing consumption and high barriers to entry, typically near large labor pools and extensive transportation infrastructure, including our Last Touch &#174; facilities&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe ability to leverage the organizational scale and structure of our 1.2 billion square foot O&#38;M portfolio to provide a single point of contact for our multi-market customers to address their needs through our in-house global Customer Led Solutions Team&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nservices and solutions offered through Prologis Essentials to assist our customers with their operations, energy and sustainability, mobility and workforce needs&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na strategically located, global land bank and redevelopment sites that have the potential to support the development of $39.0 billion of TEI of new logistics space on an O&#38;M basis&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nlocal teams with the expertise, experience and relationships to lease our properties and deploy capital advantageously&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndevelopment of logistics facilities with sustainable design features that meet customer needs for high-quality buildings while enabling them to make progress on their own sustainability objectives&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nrelationships and successful track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business that is comprised of 95% perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures and two publicly traded vehicles&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na market intelligence team that allows us to track business conditions in real time, proactively pursue market opportunities and disruptions alike, and develop revenue-generating capabilities to strengthen our operational excellence&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nan investment in technology and talent to support our sustainability objectives, including expanding our efforts around renewable energy&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nPrologis Ventures, our corporate venture capital group, and Prologis Labs, our initiative for testing new technologies alongside our customers, together track the leading edge of innovation and technologies within real estate and the supply chain, creating important capabilities that connect Prologis with the C-suites of our customers&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\na strong balance sheet and credit ratings, coupled with significant liquidity, borrowing capacity and long-term fixed debt with low rates. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nCustomers\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, in our Real Estate Segment representing our consolidated properties, we had more than 4,000 customers occupying 601 million square feet of logistics operating properties (6,600 customers occupying 1.2 billion square feet for our O&#38;M portfolio). Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local logistics users who operate in various industries, providing diverse goods to consumers throughout the globe.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe location of our global portfolio gives us the unique ability to provide our customers with the right real estate solutions for their supply chains that, in turn, allows them to meet end-consumer delivery expectations. We have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day access (defined as Last Touch&#174;) and next day access (defined as city distribution), to the consumer population. We have also invested in facilities located at key transportation hubs on the edge of these major infill and urban areas and gateway distribution facilities that incorporate access to major sea and intermodal ports.\n\n&#160;\n\nBelow are the primary categories of goods in our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2022 . \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nNER is calculated using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease divided by the lease term to determine the average amount of cash rent payments received per year.

At December 31, 2022, we had 162 investors in our private equity ventures, several of which invest in multiple ventures.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur People\n\n&#160;\n\nOur people are the foundation of our business. They implement our strategy and create value for our customers and shareholders. We actively seek to recruit and retain talented employees with varied experiences and viewpoints. The intent is to create an inclusive and diverse culture where each employee can do their best work and drive our collective success. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are committed to our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (&#8220;DEIB&#8221;) hiring practices. We also conduct annual pay equity analyses that cover women and people of color and aim to address differences in compensation not explained by relevant job factors accordingly. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following charts display diversity by levels of seniority of our workforce at December 31, 2022: \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\nManagers include employees with manager, director or vice president titles. Senior leaders include employees with senior vice president or higher titles. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe focus on learning and development at every level of the organization. We align employees&#8217; goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the long-term success of the company. We then provide feedback on their performance towards those goals to ensure their growth. Providing our employees learning and development through training, educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate. In 2022, more than 2,000 employees completed more than 7,400 hours of company-provided or company-sponsored learning and development training.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe provide opportunities for our employees to share their perspectives and feedback on our company and their work experience. Our most recent employee engagement pulse survey, completed in November 2022 with a participation rate of 92%, indicated that 87% of Prologis employees are engaged based on their positive response to the questions that comprise our engagement driver index.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe strive to create a healthy and safe working environment for our employees. We provide workplace flexibility with accountability as determined by role. For example, for those employees who work on-site, we have protocols in place to help ensure a safe working environment. We continue to attract and retain talent in the industry through a robust benefit package, career growth opportunities, talent recognition and individual development planning. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes our total number of employees at December 31, 2022:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Geographies\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nU.S. (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,481\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Americas\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEurope\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAsia\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,466\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nThis includes employees who were based in the U.S. but also support other geographies. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, other than in Brazil, France and Spain, and there is a works council in France.\n\n&#160;\n\nCODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\n&#160;\n\nWe maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com . In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website. \n\n&#160;\n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) \n\n&#160;\n\nEnvironmental\n\n&#160;\n\nWe develop modern and efficient buildings with state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of our customers&#8217; needs, advance structural, transportation and energy requirements, and make progress on our own sustainability goals and objectives. This includes new development and redevelopment of buildings to specifications that align with leading sustainable building standards and the implementation of energy solutions such as onsite solar generation , cool roofs, LED lighting, EV charging stations, waste diversion, recycling and xeriscaping. We regularly ask customers how Prologis can work with them to enhance the sustainability of their operations. We believe these services and solutions can deliver cost-savings and operational efficiencies, reduce energy and water consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions within our customers&#8217; operations and across our own portfolio.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have committed to: (i) installing 100% LED lighting within our logistics facilities across our O&#38;M operating properties by 2025&#59; (ii) installing 1 gigawatt of solar generation capacity, supported by storage, by 2025, and (iii) obtaining green building certifications for 100% of our eligible new development and redevelopment. We believe our Prologis Essentials LED and SolarSmart solutions create energy savings, help reduce the environmental footprint of our customers and accelerate our progress in these areas. At December 31, 2022, we had installed LED lighting across more than 70% of our logistics facilities within our O&#38;M operating properties. During 2022, approximately 100 megawatts of solar generation capacity was installed on the roofs within our O&#38;M portfolio. Both of these metrics exclude the operating properties acquired in the Duke Transaction and by Prologis European Logistics Fund ( &#8220; PELF&#8221;) in September 2022. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTo fund our sustainable development activities, we have utilized the proceeds from senior notes issuances to finance green projects eligible under our green bond framework. For development properties in our O&#38;M portfolio that were approved by our Investment Committee after June 2021 and that reached stabilization during 2022, we certified 15% of our eligible developed and redeveloped buildings with green building certifications and the remaining 85% were scheduled for green building certification. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2022, we announced a new commitment to achieve net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2040, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our commitment is aligned with the Science Based Target initiative&#8217;s Net Zero Standard and includes the following interim milestones: (i) 1 gigawatt of solar generation capacity, supported by storage, by 2025, as discussed above&#59; (ii) carbon neutral construction by 2025&#59; and (iii) net zero operations for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. We believe we can improve our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions through energy efficiency, electrification and sourcing renewable energy for our offices. Scope 3 emissions comprise a significant portion of our total emissions. To decrease scope 3 emissions, we believe we can reduce building and tenant energy consumption, and expand our generation and use of renewable energy. In support of carbon neutral construction, we will pursue sustainable design, new construction practices and innovation in building materials, as well as purchase high-quality carbon offsets for emissions that cannot yet be eliminated. \n\n&#160;\n\nSocial\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions, and DEIB initiatives. We work in partnership with local leaders and\n\norganizations to create jobs and job training programs&#59; promote health and safety&#59; and enhance recreational and transit infrastructure. We believe these efforts help create a more stable and predictable business environment for Prologis and our customers and support social wellness and well-being in the communities we serve. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor our customers, where recruitment and retention of logistics talent is a key challenge, we are helping build a talent pipeline through our Community Workforce Initiative (&#8220;CWI&#8221;), founded in 2018. The CWI is a talent development program that advances the skills and capabilities of logistics talent, with an emphasis on revitalizing career pathways and creating economic opportunities in the communities where we operate. In 2018, we set a goal to train 25,000 individuals by 2025 by partnering with leading public sector organizations and leveraging digital learning technologies to develop innovative training solutions. At December 31, 2022, under the program, we have trained approximately 21,000 individuals towards this goal. \n\n&#160;\n\nBeginning in 2019, we committed to spending 75,000 hours supporting our local communities by 2025. To achieve this goal, we enable our employees to spend 40 working hours a year to volunteer, including at our company-sponsored day of volunteering, where employees around the globe volunteer on projects to help in their local communities. At December 31, 2022, we have contributed in excess of 38,000 hours towards our goal. In addition, we encourage our employees to support our local communities outside of working hours with our Dollars for Doers and other matching gifts programs, through which Prologis donates to eligible charities and non-profit organizations based on employees&#8217; personal volunteer hours or dollar donations.\n\n&#160;\n\nGovernance\n\n&#160;\n\nWe strive to promote a culture of uncompromising integrity, including through our governance practices and corporate oversight. Our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions all serve to mitigate risk and preserve value for our company. Over the past eight years we have onboarded six new directors, increasing the ethnic, gender and geographical diversity of the Board, as well as its breadth of experience. The charters of our Board Governance and Nomination Committee and Talent and Compensation Committee provide that such committees have specific oversight over ESG matters and DEIB matters, respectively. The strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, dedication to proactive risk mitigation and engagement with our employees through ethics and anti-corruption training protects the financial, operational and reputational resilience of our company. Our global risk management team works with our Board to do regular enterprise-wide risk assessments to ensure proper oversight over real estate, financial and emerging risks across our global organization. We are committed to ensuring that 100% of our employees complete ethics training each year and continued to achieve this commitment in 2022. Along with this commitment, our employees completed more than 1,800 hours of information technology security, compliance and other ethics training. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above. \n\n&#160;\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded at December 31, 2022. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\n&#160;\n\nGOVERNMENTAL MATTERS\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to various regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses, adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and \n\n&#160;\n\nfinancial condition. In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations. The impact of regional or country-specific economic instability, including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\n&#160;\n\nINSURANCE COVERAGE\n\n&#160;\n\nWe carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism&#59; commercial general liability insurance&#59; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. Additionally, in 2021 we sponsored a catastrophe bond issuance that provides further insurance coverage through 2024 for potential losses resulting from earthquake risks in the U.S. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\n&#160;\n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 1A. Risk Factors \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including but not limited to, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities. These risks relate to Prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others, (i) risks related to our global operations (ii) risks related to our business&#59; (iii) risks related to financing and capital&#59; (iv) risks related to income taxes&#59; and (v) general risks.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to our Global Operations\n\n&#160;\n\nAs a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the U.S. During 2022, we generated approximately $1.0 billion or 17.3% of our consolidated revenues from operations outside the U.S. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include, but are not limited to, the following factors:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain geographies, including differing employment practices and labor issues&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nlocal businesses and cultural factors that differ from our domestic standards and practices&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nvolatility in currencies and currency restrictions, which may prevent the availability of capital or the transfer of profits to the U.S.&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nchallenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) Bribery Act and other similar laws&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nunexpected changes in regulatory and environmental requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles, military conflicts and economic instability, including government shutdowns and withdrawals from the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\npolitical instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nforeign ownership restrictions in operations with the respective countries&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\naccess to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other factors.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCompliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, including (but not limited to) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and state and local fire, life-safety, energy and greenhouse gas emissions requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us.\n\n&#160;\n\nDisruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nTo the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties&#59; (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing&#59; (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due&#59; and (iv) the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2022, approximately $10.2 billion or 11.6% of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, principally the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen. For the year ended December 31, 2022, $762.4 million or 17.2% of our total consolidated segment NOI was denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on these amounts. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and, specifically, our U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to these risks.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. We enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries. Although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful. In addition, we occasionally use interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate risk and limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage. The failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to our Business\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to the economic conditions and other events and occurrences in the local, regional, national and international geographies in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, 30.3% of our consolidated operating properties or $21.0 billion (based on consolidated gross book value, or investment before depreciation) were located in California (Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California markets), which represented 23.6% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 33.0% of our consolidated operating property NOI. Our revenues from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California&#8217;s economic climate. Because of the investment we have located in California, a downturn in California&#8217;s economy or real estate conditions, including state income tax and property tax laws, could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3% of total consolidated investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain markets located in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Lehigh Valley, New Jersey/New York City, Seattle and South Florida. Of these markets, no single market contributed more than 10% of our total \n\n&#160;\n\nconsolidated investment before depreciation in operating properties , with the exception of New Jersey/New York City . Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur O&#38;M portfolio, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in Japan and the U.K., and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets.\n\n&#160;\n\nReal estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors.\n\n&#160;\n\nReal estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. Significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage debt payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. As a REIT, under the IRC, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. We may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity. If we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our co-investment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities. Our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by: (i) competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties&#59; (ii) economic and market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties&#59; and (iii) other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all. The co-investment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. Should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions and contributions could be delayed. \n\n&#160;\n\nIf we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations, sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting properties at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business, and in particular, our distributable cash flow and debt covenants.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified.\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our asset management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nlocal conditions, such as oversupply or a reduction in demand&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ntechnological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3D printing or other technologies&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe attractiveness of our properties to potential customers and competition from other available properties&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nincreasing costs of maintaining, insuring, renovating and making improvements to our properties&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour ability to reposition our properties due to changes in the business and logistics needs of our customers&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour ability to lease the properties at favorable rates and control variable operating costs&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ngovernmental and environmental regulations and the associated potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, usage, tax, tariffs and other laws. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThese factors may affect our ability to recover our investment in the properties and result in impairment charges. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. At December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 16.4% of our consolidated NER and 14.4% of our O&#38;M NER. In the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and we may be unable to re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer&#8217;s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer&#8217;s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire or we may lose potential customers.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may acquire properties and companies that involve risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate, the acquisition of entities that own real estate or through additional investments in co-investment ventures that acquire properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with entering a new market such as a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. The acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities, including tax liabilities, which may be without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based on our new ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe may be unable to integrate the operations of newly acquired companies and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include: (i) the inability to dispose of non-industrial assets or operations that are outside of our area of expertise&#59; (ii) potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with these transactions&#59; and (iii) performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management&#8217;s attention caused by completing these transactions and integrating the companies&#8217; operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur real estate development and redevelopment strategy is focused on monetizing land and redevelopment sites in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for long-term investment and for contribution or sale to a co-investment venture or third party, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may increase our investment in the development, renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the build-out and leasing of our current development portfolio. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may explore development opportunities that may be abandoned and the related investment impaired&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may incur higher construction costs, due primarily to this inflationary environment, or additional costs related to regulation that exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned due to defects or other issues&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may not be able to attract third-party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may have properties that perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flows below budgeted amounts&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment, resulting in impairment charges&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may not be able to lease properties we develop on favorable terms or at all&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our value-added properties on expected timetables or at all&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public or government opposition to our activities&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nwe may have substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, that require a significant amount of management&#8217;s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming and attracting third-party investment in co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, and managing properties through co-investment ventures.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had investments in co-investment ventures, both public and private, that owned real estate with a gross book value of approximately $59.6 billion. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, or attract third-party investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from our existing or future investments. The same factors that impact the valuation of our consolidated portfolio, as discussed above, also impact the portfolios held by the co-investment ventures and could result in other than temporary impairment of our investment and a reduction in fee revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur co-investment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions made on behalf of the ventures&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour partners may seek to redeem their investment, and may do so simultaneously, causing the venture to seek capital to satisfy these requests on less than optimal terms&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nif our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the venture&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nthe venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nour relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, we may not continue to invest in or manage the assets underlying such relationships resulting in a decrease in our assets under management and a reduction in fee revenues. This may also require us to acquire the properties in order to maintain an investment in the portfolio&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndisputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives&#59; however, we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely. We have formed publicly traded investment vehicles, such as NPR and FIBRA Prologis, for which we serve as sponsor or manager. These entities bear their own risks related to trading markets, foreign currency exchange rates and market demand. We have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. There is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have also made investments in early and growth-stage companies that are focused on emerging technology. These companies may not be successful at raising additional capital or generating cash flows to sustain operations, which could result in the impairment of our investment. In addition, through Prologis Essentials we are investing in the development of new business lines that are complementary to our core business. These business lines may not be successful and may include risks that are different than investing in our core real estate business.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to various environmental risks, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or \n\n&#160;\n\noperator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. \n\n&#160;\n\nEnvironmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism&#59; commercial general liability insurance&#59; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our co-investment ventures are adequately insured. Certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots and pandemics, generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#160;\n\nA number of our investments, both wholly-owned and owned through co-investment ventures, are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in California and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self-insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in Japan based on this analysis. See Item 2. Properties for more information on the markets above exposed to seismic activities. \n\n&#160;\n\nFurthermore, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to Financing and Capital\n\n&#160;\n\nIn order to meet REIT distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital.\n\n&#160;\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, however, we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Furthermore, to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term \n\n&#160;\n\nborrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities. \n\n&#160;\n\nCovenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe terms of our various credit agreements, including our credit facilities and term loans, the indentures under which certain of our senior notes are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios, leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. These covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, our business and financial condition generally and, in particular, the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160;\n\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our credit ratings were A3 from Moody&#8217;s with a stable outlook and A from S&#38;P with a stable outlook. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. Our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the OP.\n\n&#160;\n\nAny additional future issuance of common stock or OP units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors. In most circumstances, stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or OP units and the utilization of the proceeds, our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to Income Tax\n\n&#160;\n\nThe failure of Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences.\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, Inc. elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe Prologis, Inc. has been organized and operated to qualify as a REIT under the IRC and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the IRC to enable Prologis, Inc. to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause Prologis, Inc. to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some annually and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the IRC for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, Prologis, Inc. must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, Prologis, Inc. must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or \n\n&#160;\n\nother property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. The provisions of the I RC and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated for Prologis, Inc. because we hold substantially all of our assets through the OP. \n\n&#160;\n\nIf Prologis, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including, for taxable years prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, Prologis, Inc. would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of REIT re-election if recognized within the five-year period after re-election, and potentially 10 years for certain states. If Prologis, Inc. lost its REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distributions would be reduced.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs that elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT 95% and 75% gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the ability of Prologis, Inc. to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus its ability to qualify as a REIT.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, we may acquire properties through the acquisition of REIT entities that own the real estate. If a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions, and such entities were to fail to satisfy the REIT requirements for any year, they would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which the REIT qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of REIT re-election or, if earlier, at the time of Prologis&#8217; acquisition of the assets. A sale of such assets within the 5-year recognition period, and potentially 10 years for certain states, could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant. \n\n&#160;\n\nCertain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction.\n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the IRC, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the IRS would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT.\n\n&#160;\n\nLegislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the U.S., state, local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate, REITs, similar entities and investments. Additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future, both in and outside of the U.S. and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders. Any increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes.\n\n&#160;\n\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur use of taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;) enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the IRC, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities.\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral Risks\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected by the impact of global pandemics. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe cannot predict the extent to which global pandemics may impact our business and operating results and that of our co-investment ventures, but their impact may include the following:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nExisting customers and potential customers of our logistics facilities may be adversely affected by the decrease in economic activity, which in turn could disrupt their business and their ability to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGovernment, labor or other restrictions may prevent us from completing the development or leasing of properties currently under development or making our properties ready for our customers to move in&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOur ability to recover our investments in real estate assets may be impacted by current market conditions&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIncreases in material costs as a result of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions may make the development of properties more costly than we originally budgeted&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOur workforce, including our executives, may become ill or have difficulty working remotely, caring for our properties and/or customers. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAny prolonged economic downturn, escalation of the outbreak or disruption in the financial markets may also impact our ability to access capital markets to issue debt or equity securities and to complete real estate transactions at attractive pricing or at all.\n\n&#160;\n\nThese items may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and real estate values.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.\n\n&#160;\n\nDespite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as malware, ransomware, or unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Third-party security events at vendors, sub-processors, and service providers could also impact our data and operations via unauthorized access to information or disruption of services which may ultimately result in financial losses. Despite training, detection systems and response procedures, an increase in email attacks (phishing and business email compromise) may create disruption to our business and financial risk.\n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough security incidents have had an insignificant financial impact on our operating results, the growing frequency of attempts may lead to increased costs to protect the company and respond to any events, including additional personnel, consultants and protection technologies. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. Additionally, remediation costs for security events may not be covered by our insurance.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks associated with our dependence on key personnel.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. While we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and could be required to implement new or stricter regulations, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our logistics facilities and the global supply chain may be exposed to catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases, our exposure to these events could increase. We may also be adversely impacted by transition risks, such as potential impacts to the supply chain as a real estate developer or changes in laws and regulations, such as stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors. We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. The potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n"

Our O&#38;M operating portfolio occupancy was 98.2% at December 31, 2022 and rent change on leases commenced during 2022 was 48.0%, on a net effective basis, based on our ownership share. Our 2022 results are representative of the prospects we see for our business despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets, ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe that are all pressuring the global economy. Due to current market conditions, we expect some decline in asset valuations in 2023 and therefore will continue to be disciplined as we evaluate capital deployment activities , including a focus on build-to-suit developments and a pause on contributions into our open-ended funds in the near term. We believe we are well-positioned to organically grow revenues given the increase in market rents over the last several years and our high lease mark-to-market. However, we will be cautious as we manage our business in this uncertain environment. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe completed the following significant activities in 2022, as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nOn October 3, 2022, we completed the Duke Transaction for $23.2 billion through the issuance of equity and assumption of debt. We assumed $4.2 billion of debt with a weighted average stated interest rate of 2.3% and 4.9% at fair value. We paid down the balance of $745 million on Duke&#8217;s line of credit subsequent to closing the acquisition. The Duke portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 494 industrial operating properties, aggregating 144 million square feet. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWe generated net proceeds of $2.7 billion and realized net gains of $1.2 billion, principally from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in Europe and Japan and dispositions of non-strategic assets to third parties, primarily in the U.S. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWe earned promotes aggregating $505 million ($386 million net of related strategic capital expenses), primarily during the third quarter of 2022 from the third-party investors in PELF in Europe. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nWith the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we operate, in 2022 we realized net gains upon settlement of undesignated derivative instruments that offset the negative impact of the translation of our earnings to U.S. dollars. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nIn June, we terminated our global senior credit facility (the &#8220;2019 Global Facility&#8221;) and entered into the 2022 Global Facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $3.0 billion and an extended initial maturity date of June 2026. We also upsized our second global senior credit facility (the &#8220;2021 Global Facility&#8221;), increasing its borrowing capacity up to $2.0 billion. This resulted in increasing our total borrowing capacity under both facilities to $5.0 billion and modifying the base rate of the aggregate lender commitments in U.S. dollars from the U.S. dollar London Inter-bank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had total available liquidity of $4.1 billion, with aggregate availability under our credit facilities of $3.9 billion and unrestricted cash balances of $278 million. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had total senior notes of $19.8 billion, with a weighted average remaining maturity of 10 years and an effective interest rate of 2.3%. In addition to the senior notes assumed in the Duke Transaction, we issued $3.3 billion of senior notes in 2022 (principal in millions): \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAggregate Principal\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIssuance Date Weighted Average\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIssuance Date\n\n&#160;\n\nBorrowing Currency\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nUSD (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInterest Rate\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nYears\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMaturity Dates\n\n&#160;\n\nJanuary\n\n&#160;\n\n&#163;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2.1%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n20.0\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2041\n\n&#160;\n\nFebruary (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8364;\n\n1,550\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,768\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.0%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8.5\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFebruary 2024 &#8211; 2034\n\n&#160;\n\nJuly\n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n30,965\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.4%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n15.5\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJuly 2027 &#8211; 2042\n\n&#160;\n\nSeptember (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4.6%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10.3\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJanuary 2033\n\n&#160;\n\nNovember\n\n&#160;\n\nC$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n5.3%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8.2\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJanuary 2031\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember\n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n24,200\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.8%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n13.4\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2027 &#8211; 2037\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,266\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2.3%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9.8\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(1) \n\nThe exchange rate used to calculate into U.S. dollars was the spot rate at the settlement date. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(2) \n\nA portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to finance green projects eligible under our green bond framework. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nOn October 6, 2022, we completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation for nine series of Duke&#8217;s senior notes for an aggregate amount of $3.4 billion, with $3.2 billion, or 96%, of the aggregate principal amount being validly tendered for exchange. The validly tendered senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by the OP. As a result of the consent solicitation, we have no separate remaining financial reporting obligations or financial covenants associated with the senior notes assumed in the Duke Transaction. All other terms of the assumed Duke senior notes remained substantially the same. \n\n&#160;\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160;\n\nWe evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\nBelow is our NOI by segment per our Consolidated Financial Statements and a reconciliation of NOI by segment to Operating Income per the Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReal estate segment:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Rental revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,913\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,148\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Development management and other revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Rental expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,206\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,041\n\n)\n\n&#160; Other expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(40\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(22\n\n)\n\nReal Estate Segment &#8211; NOI\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,688\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,105\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStrategic capital segment:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Strategic capital revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,040\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Strategic capital expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(304\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(207\n\n)\n\n&#160; Strategic Capital Segment&#8211; NOI\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(331\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(294\n\n)\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,813\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,578\n\n)\n\nOperating income before gains on real estate transactions, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,280\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,617\n\n&#160;\n\nGains on dispositions of development properties and land, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGains on other dispositions of investments in real estate, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating income\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,467\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,207\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment&#8217;s NOI to Operating Income and Earnings Before Income Taxes. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReal Estate Segment\n\n&#160;\n\nThis operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties.

We primarily recognized intangible liabilities for the lower in-place rents, as compared to current market rents, under the acquired leases from Duke. These intangible liabilities are amortized to rental revenues over the remaining lease term, which on average is 64 months. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nDuring both periods, we experienced positive rental rate growth. Rental rate growth is a combination of higher rental rates on rollover of leases (or rent change) and contractual rent increases on existing leases. If a lease has a contractual rent increase driven by a metric that is not known at the time the lease commences, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore impacts the rental revenue we recognize. Significant rent change during both periods continues to be a key driver in increasing rental income. See below for key metrics on rent change on rollover and occupancy. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nWe calculate changes in NOI from development completions period over period by comparing the change in NOI generated on the pool of developments that completed on or after January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBelow are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio, which excludes non-strategic industrial properties. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nIn 2022, we completed the Duke Transaction. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nConsolidated square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nDevelopment Activity\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes consolidated development activity (dollars and square feet in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStarts:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNumber of new development buildings during the period\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSquare feet\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTEI\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,679\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,478\n\n&#160;\n\nPercentage of build-to-suits based on TEI\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n39.1\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n46.2\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStabilizations:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNumber of development buildings stabilized during the period\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSquare feet\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTEI\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,772\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,329\n\n&#160;\n\nPercentage of build-to-suits based on TEI\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n38.9\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n42.7\n\n%\n\nWeighted average stabilized yield (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6.2\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6.1\n\n%\n\nEstimated value at completion\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,294\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,613\n\n&#160;\n\nEstimated weighted average margin (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n54.9\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n55.1\n\n%\n\nEstimated value creation\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,522\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,284\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nWe calculate the weighted average stabilized yield as estimated NOI assuming stabilized occupancy divided by TEI. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nEstimated weighted average margin is calculated on development properties as estimated value creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by TEI. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and pre-stabilized properties, was expected to be completed before November 2024 with a TEI of $7.5 billion and was 45.2% leased.

Our investment in the development portfolio was $4.2 billion at December 31, 2022 leaving $3.3 billion remaining to be spent.

The following graph summarizes capitalized expenditures, excluding development costs, of our consolidated operating properties during each year:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur capital expenditures continue to increase year over year as we grow the consolidated operating portfolio through development and acquisitions. We plan to continue allocating capital in 2023 to renovate and modernize our operating portfolio, including the addition of sustainable and efficient building features.\n\n&#160;\n\nStrategic Capital Segment\n\n&#160;\n\nThis operating segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services performed, transactional services for acquisition, disposition and leasing activity and promote revenue earned primarily from the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Revenues associated with the Strategic Capital Segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes. These revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Strategic Capital Segment through Strategic Capital Expenses and to the Real Estate Segment through Rental Expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios.

The increase in fees is primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by the increases in the fair value of the properties based on third party valuations.

An increase in asset valuations in the co-investment ventures during the promote period is one of the significant drivers of returns that can translate into earning future promote revenues. Included above is promote revenue earned from PELF in September 2022. Approximately 40% of the promote earned by us from the co-investment ventures is paid to our employees as a combination of cash and stock-based awards pursuant to the terms of the PPP and expensed through Strategic Capital Expenses, as vested. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nG&#38;A Expenses\n\n&#160;\n\nG&#38;A expenses were $331 million and $294 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. G&#38;A expenses increased in 2022 as compared to 2021, principally due to inflationary increases and higher compensation expenses based on our performance. We expect that 2023 will include additional investments we are making in our Prologis Essentials business, primarily in the energy teams. We capitalize certain internal costs that are incremental and directly related to our development and building improvement activities.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes capitalized G&#38;A (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBuilding and land development activities\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating building improvements and other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal capitalized G&#38;A expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\nCapitalized salaries and related costs as a percent of total salaries and related costs\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n22.7\n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n21.9\n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\n\n&#160;\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe change in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 of approximately $235 million was impacted by the following activities (in millions): \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nIncluded in acquisitions are the operating properties, other real estate properties and related lease intangibles acquired in the Duke Transaction. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nGains on Real Estate Transactions, Net\n\n&#160;\n\nGains on the disposition of development properties and land were $598 million and $817 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and primarily included gains from the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in Europe and Japan for 2022 and additionally in the U.S. for 2021. Gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate were $589 million and $773 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included sales of non-strategic operating properties in the U.S., including properties acquired in the LPT Transaction and the IPT Transaction. Additionally, 2021 included the sale of our ownership interest in one of our \n\n&#160;\n\nunconsolidated ventures and the contribution of operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment venture in the U.S. We utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our development activities during both periods. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur Owned and Managed (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) Operating Portfolio\n\n&#160;\n\nWe manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O&#38;M basis, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the Real Estate Segment and the Strategic Capital Segment, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of GAAP and the presentation of the ventures&#8217; operating information does not represent a legal claim. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur O&#38;M operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio, value-added properties, non-industrial properties or properties we do not have the intent to hold long-term that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments. Value-added properties are properties we have either acquired at a discount and believe we could provide greater returns post-stabilization or properties we expect to repurpose to a higher and better use.

We retained approximately 70% or more of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced, for each year. In 2022, we experienced a significant increase in net effective rent change due to increasing market rents. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n(2) \n\nTurnover costs include external leasing commissions and tenant improvements and represent the obligations incurred in connection with the lease commencement for leases greater than one year. In 2022, spend on turnover costs remained similar to 2021, however, the value of the leases commenced increased due to strong market rent growth. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nSame Store Analysis\n\n&#160;\n\nOur same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a &#8220;same store&#8221; analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. We determine our same store metrics on property NOI, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe define our same store population for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as the properties in our O&#38;M operating portfolio, including the property NOI for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at January 1, 2021 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2021 and 2022. We believe the drivers of property NOI for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the O&#38;M portfolio based on Prologis&#8217; ownership in the properties (&#8220;Prologis Share&#8221;). The same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning \n\n&#160;\n\nof the period (January 1, 20 2 1 ) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs non-GAAP financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of Rental Revenues less Rental Expenses (&#8220;Property NOI&#8221;) (from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to our Same Store Property NOI measures.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental expenses and property NOI for each quarter in 2022 and 2021 to the full year, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and within Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended December 31 (dollars in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJune 30,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFull Year\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRental revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,077\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,093\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,152\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,591\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,913\n\n&#160;\n\nRental expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(276\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(270\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(285\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(375\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,206\n\n)\n\nProperty NOI\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,216\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,707\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRental revenues\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,015\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,037\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,074\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,148\n\n&#160;\n\nRental expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(278\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(245\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(256\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(262\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1,041\n\n)\n\nProperty NOI\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,107\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n% Change\n\n&#160;\n\nReconciliation of Consolidated Property NOI to Same Store Property NOI measures:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRental revenues\n\n$\n\n1,591\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,074\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRental expenses\n\n&#160;\n\n(375\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(262\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidated Property NOI\n\n$\n\n1,216\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdjustments to derive same store results:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nProperty NOI from consolidated properties not included in same store portfolio and\n\n&#160;

We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property&#8217;s rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property&#8217;s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. Same Store Property NOI is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (2) \n\nWe include the Property NOI for the same store portfolio for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the co-investment ventures based on our investment in the underlying properties. In order to calculate our share of Same Store Property NOI from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100%, we use the co-investment ventures&#8217; underlying Property NOI for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at December 31, 2022 to the Property NOI for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. We adjust the total Property NOI from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties&#8217; share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures . \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring the periods presented, certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). As a result, only line items labeled &#8220;Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI&#8221; are comparable period over period.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (3) \n\nWe further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and amortization of fair value lease adjustments) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to reflect a Same Store Property NOI &#8211; Cash measure. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our O&#38;M portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis.

Included in 2021 is our share of the gains recognized upon the sale of certain non-strategic assets acquired in the IPT Transaction and the sale by UKLV of its operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, PELF and PELP. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture&#59; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture&#59; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt&#59; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture&#59; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars.

We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk related to our investments by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge. We recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the translation adjustment on the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses. We may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our earnings.

Our current income tax expense (benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income, including gains on the disposition of properties and fees earned from the co-investment ventures.

We had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of $191 million and $209 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in these amounts were $92 million and $82 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of Prologis, L.P. Included in 2021 was the sale of non-strategic operating properties in our consolidated co-investment venture in the U.S.\n\n&#160;\n\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss) \n\n&#160;\n\nThe key driver of changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (&#8220;AOCI/L&#8221;) in 2022 and 2021 was the currency translation adjustment derived from changes in exchange rates during both periods primarily on our net investments in real estate outside the U.S. and the borrowings we issue in the functional currencies of the countries where we invest.

We receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our Real Estate Segment, including the recovery of our operating costs. Cash flows generated by the Real Estate Segment are impacted by our acquisition, development and disposition activities, which are drivers of NOI recognized during each period. See the Results of Operations section above for further explanation of our Real Estate Segment.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this activity. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nInvesting Activities\n\n&#160;\n\nCash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from the sale of real estate assets that include the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures as well as the sale of operating properties. Contribution and disposition activity in 2022 was significantly lower than in 2021 due to the sale of non-strategic assets in 2021 and a pause on contributions in the fourth quarter of 2022. Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures as discussed above. Acquisition activity includes land for future development, operating properties and other real estate assets. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these activities. In addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash used in and provided by investing activities: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDuke Transaction, net of cash acquired .

Loan-to-value, a non-GAAP measure, was calculated as the percentage of total third-party debt to the gross book value of real estate for each venture and weighted based on the cumulative gross book value of all unconsolidated co-investment ventures. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. In our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. There can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. If the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. Certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDividend and Distribution Requirements\n\n&#160;\n\nOur dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the IRC, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund our capital deployment and other investment activities. \n\n&#160;\n\nUnder the IRC, REITs may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.79 and $0.63 per common share in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. The Class A common limited partnership units (&#8220;Class A Units&#8221;) in the OP are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. We paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.64665 per Class A Unit in 2022 and 2021. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our Series Q preferred stock had an annual dividend rate of 8.54% per share and the dividends are payable quarterly in arrears.\n\n&#160;\n\nPursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Commitments\n\n&#160;\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties. \n\n&#160;\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n&#160;\n\nA critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. Management&#8217;s judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies as they relate to our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and our operating results for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.\n\n&#160;\n\nAsset Acquisitions\n\n&#160;\n\nWe generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition. We measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged. The difference between the cost and the estimated fair value (excess or bargain consideration) is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. Assets we do not intend to hold long-term are recorded at fair value. At a property-level, we allocate the fair value to the components, which include building, land, improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases. The most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fair value of real estate properties subject to purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net operating income of a property. Key assumptions may include market rents and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. The use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the depreciation expense we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life.\n\n&#160;\n\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets\n\n&#160;\n\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the \n\n&#160;\n\nexpected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net operating income of the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment. \n\n&#160;\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n&#160;\n\nNone.\n\n&#160;\n\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS (&#8220;FFO&#8221;)\n\n&#160;\n\nFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (&#8220;NAREIT&#8221;) defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales net of any related tax, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties&#8217; share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur FFO Measures\n\n&#160;\n\nOur FFO measures begin with NAREIT&#8217;s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis and Core FFO , both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.\n\n&#160;\n\nThese FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nFFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (&#8220;FFO, as modified by Prologis&#8221;)\n\n&#160;\n\nTo arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis , we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ndeferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ncurrent income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (i) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities, (ii) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities, (iii) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions, and (iv) mark-to-market adjustments associated with other derivative financial instruments. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe use FFO, as modified by Prologis , so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S.\n\n&#160;\n\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (&#8220;Core FFO&#8221;)\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis , we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis , to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis :\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ngains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nincome tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nimpairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\ngains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nexpenses related to natural disasters. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe use Core FFO , including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies&#59; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods&#59; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management&#59; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources&#59; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance&#59; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.\n\n&#160;\n\nLimitations on the use of our FFO measures\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT&#8217;s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nGains or losses from property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nThe natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP as follows (in millions):\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReconciliation of net earnings attributable to common stockholders to FFO measures:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,359\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,934\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdd (deduct) NAREIT defined adjustments:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReal estate related depreciation and amortization\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,763\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,534\n\n&#160;\n\nGains on other dispositions of investments in real estate, net of taxes\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(595\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(749\n\n)\n\nReconciling items related to noncontrolling interests\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(13\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur share of reconciling items included in earnings related to unconsolidated entities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNAREIT defined FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,877\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,924\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdd (deduct) our modified adjustments:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nUnrealized foreign currency and derivative gains, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(85\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(173\n\n)\n\nDeferred income tax expense\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrent income tax expense (benefit) on dispositions related to acquired tax liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(21\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReconciling items related to noncontrolling interests\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n-\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur share of reconciling items included in earnings related to unconsolidated entities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(42\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(1\n\n)\n\nFFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n4,742\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,755\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdjustments to arrive at Core FFO:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGains on dispositions of development properties and land, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(598\n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(817\n\n)\n\nCurrent income tax expense on dispositions\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLosses on early extinguishment of debt, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReconciling items related to noncontrolling interests\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur share of reconciling items included in earnings related to unconsolidated entities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4,188\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,172\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange-related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes. See our risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors, specifically Risks Related to our Global Operations and Risks Related to Financing and Capital. See also Notes 2 and 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at December 31, 2022. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections. The sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value. As a result, revenues and expenses, as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period, hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\n\n&#160;\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. Additionally, we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. At December 31, 2022, after consideration of our ability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, $975 million or 16% of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries. We have forward contracts that were not designated as hedges, denominated principally in British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen, and have an aggregate notional amount of $1.6 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies. The gain or loss on settlement of these contracts is included in our earnings and offsets the lower or higher translation of earnings from our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher translated U.S. dollar earnings from these currencies, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies by 10% could result in a $164 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. To mitigate that risk, we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2022, $21.1 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022, $3.3 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates.

Changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. On the basis of our sensitivity analysis, a 10% increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which equates to a change in interest rates of 25 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and 2 basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances.\n\n&#160;\n\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAssessment of the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties\n\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Company had $69,039 million of operating properties as of December 31, 2022. The Company tests the recoverability of operating properties whenever events or changes in circumstances, including shortening the expected holding period of such assets, indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We identified the assessment of the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the relevant events or changes in circumstances that the Company used to evaluate its expected holding period. A shortening of the expected holding period could indicate a potential impairment. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to determining the expected holding period of operating properties and any related changes. We evaluated the Company&#8217;s expected holding period by inquiring of the Company regarding changes to the expected holding period, considering certain factors related to the current economic environment, reading minutes of the meetings of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, reading external communications with investors and analysts, and analyzing documents prepared by the Company regarding proposed real estate transactions and potential changes to the expected holding period.\n\nDuke Realty transaction\n\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 3, 2022 Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively the &#8220;Duke Realty transaction&#8221;) for $23.2 billion and the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In asset acquisitions, the Company measures the real estate assets acquired based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess or bargain consideration is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. The components of the acquisition include an initial allocation to investments in real estate properties acquired based on fair value and an initial allocation of that fair value to buildings and land. The Company determines fair value of the real estate properties based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net operating income of a property. We identified the evaluation of the fair value allocated to investments in real estate properties acquired, including the allocation of the property fair value to land and building, in the Duke Realty transaction as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the fair value amounts estimated by the Company in the allocation involved complex auditor judgment as a result of measurement uncertainty. Specifically, testing significant assumptions of market rents and capitalization rates related to investments in real estate and testing the allocation of property fair value to land and building required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company&#8217;s fair value estimation process for investments in real estate properties, including land and building. This included controls related to the determination of amounts allocated to land and building and determination of market rents and capitalization rates used to estimate the fair value of investments in real estate properties. For a selection of investments in real estate properties we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s determination of the fair value of investments in real estate properties to sales prices from available property sales \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s market rent and capitalization rate assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of investments in real estate properties to available leasing information, industry research publications and inquiries of market participants \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s determination of the fair value of land to sales prices from available land sales \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s determination of the fair value of building to developed ranges of estimates based on market data, such as industry guides used for developing replacement building values. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2002.\n\n&#160;\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\n&#160;\n\nTo the Partners of Prologis, L.P. and the Board of Directors of Prologis, Inc.:\n\n&#160;\n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Prologis, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Operating Partnership) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Operating Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Operating Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAssessment of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties\n\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Operating Partnership had $69,039 million of operating properties as of December 31, 2022. The Operating Partnership tests the recoverability of operating properties whenever events or changes in circumstances, including shortening the expected holding period of such assets, indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We identified the assessment of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the relevant events or changes in circumstances that the Operating Partnership used to evaluate its expected holding period. A shortening of the expected holding period could indicate a potential impairment. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to determining the expected holding period of operating properties and any related changes. We evaluated the Operating Partnership&#8217;s expected holding period by inquiring of the Operating Partnership regarding changes to the expected holding period, considering certain factors related to the current economic environment, reading minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors of Prologis, Inc., reading external communications with investors and analysts, and analyzing documents prepared by the Operating Partnership regarding proposed real estate transactions and potential changes to the expected holding period.\n\nDuke Realty transaction\n\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 3, 2022 Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively the &#8220;Duke Realty transaction&#8221;) for $23.2 billion and the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In asset acquisitions, the Company measures the real estate assets acquired based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess or bargain consideration is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. The components of the acquisition include an initial allocation to investments in real estate properties acquired based on fair value and an initial allocation of that fair value to buildings and land. The Company determines fair value of the real estate properties based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization \n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nrate to the estimated net operating income of a property. We identified the evaluation of the fair value allocated to investments in real estate properties acquired, including the allocation of the property fair value to land and building, in the Duke Realty transaction as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the fair value amounts estimated by the Company in the allocation involved complex auditor judgment as a result of measurement uncertainty. Specifically, testing significant assumptions of market rents and capitalization rates related to investments in real estate and testing the allocation of property fair value to land and building required specialized skills and knowledge. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company&#8217;s fair value estimation process for investments in real estate properties, including land and building. This included controls related to the determination of amounts allocated to land and building and determination of market rents and capitalization rates used to estimate the fair value of investments in real estate properties. For a selection of investments in real estate properties we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s determination of the fair value of investments in real estate properties to sales prices from available property sales \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s market rent and capitalization rate assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of investments in real estate properties to available leasing information, industry research publications and inquiries of market participants \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s determination of the fair value of land to sales prices from available land sales \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#8226; \n\nComparing the Company&#8217;s determination of the fair value of building to developed ranges of estimates based on market data, such as industry guides used for developing replacement building values \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have served as the Operating Partnership&#8217;s auditor since 2002.\n\n&#160;\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\n&#160;\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\n\nPrologis, Inc.:\n\n&#160;\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Prologis, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company&#59; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company&#59; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n&#160;\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15

AND PROLOGIS, L.P.\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, Inc. (or the &#8220;Parent&#8221;) commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Internal Revenue Code&#8221; or &#8220;IRC&#8221;), and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable it to maintain its status as a REIT. The Parent is the general partner of Prologis, L.P. (or the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221; or &#8220;OP&#8221;). Through the OP, we are engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of logistics facilities with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We maintain a significant level of ownership in these co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity. Our current business strategy consists of two operating business segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. Our Real Estate Segment represents the ownership, leasing and development of logistics properties. Our Strategic Capital Segment represents the management of properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures. See Note 17 for further discussion of our business segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Parent and the OP. The terms &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;Prologis,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; means the Parent and OP collectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor each share of preferred or common stock the Parent issues, the OP issues a corresponding preferred or common partnership unit, as applicable, to the Parent in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. At December 31, 2022, the Parent owned a 97.60 % common general partnership interest in the OP and substantially all of the preferred units in the OP. The remaining 2.40 % common limited partnership interests, which include Class A common limited partnership units (&#8220;Class A Units&#8221;) in the OP, are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. Each partner&#8217;s percentage interest in the OP is determined based on the number of OP units held, including the number of OP units into which Class A Units are convertible, compared to total OP units outstanding at each period end and is used as the basis for the allocation of net income or loss to each partner. At the end of each reporting period, a capital adjustment is made in the OP to reflect the appropriate ownership interest for each of the common unitholders. These adjustments are reflected in the line items Reallocation of Equity in the Consolidated Statements of Equity of the Parent and Reallocation of Capital in the Consolidated Statements of Capital of the OP.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs the sole general partner of the OP, the Parent has complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the OP and we operate the Parent and the OP as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the OP. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the OP or one of its subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the OP, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP. Because the Parent&#8217;s only significant asset is its investment in the OP, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nInformation with respect to the square footage, number of buildings and acres of land is unaudited.\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis of Presentation. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and are presented in our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Intercompany transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated. \n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidation. We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control the entity, as well as any variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor entities that are not defined as VIEs, we first consider whether we are the general partner or the limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments that are not structured as partnerships). We consolidate entities in which we are the general partner and the limited partners in such entities that do not have rights that would preclude control. For entities in which we are the general partner but do not control the entity as the other partners hold substantive participating or kick-out rights, we apply the equity method of accounting since, as the general partner, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the venture. For ventures for which we are a limited partner, or our investment is in an entity that is not structured similar to a partnership, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners. In instances where the factors indicate that we have a controlling financial interest in the venture, we consolidate the entity. In instances where we do not have a controlling interest in the venture, we apply the equity method of accounting when the factors indicate we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the venture. &#160; \n\n&#160;\n\nUse of Estimates. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting \n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nperiod. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we made are reasonable and appropriate, as discussed in the applicable sections throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported results. \n\n&#160;\n\nForeign Operations. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in the U.S. and Mexico. The functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in other countries is the principal currency in which the entity&#8217;s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated, which may be different from the local currency of the country of incorporation or where the entity conducts its operations. The functional currencies of entities outside of the U.S. and Mexico generally include the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swedish krona. We take part in business transactions denominated in these and other local currencies where we operate. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries&#8217; financial statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (&#8220; AOCI/L &#8221;) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected at the historical exchange rate. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period&#59; income statement accounts that represent significant nonrecurring transactions, are translated at the rate in effect at the date of the transaction. We translate our share of the net income or loss of our unconsolidated entities at the average exchange rate for the period other than significant nonrecurring transactions of the unconsolidated entities which are translated at the rate in effect at the date of the transaction.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third-party debt that is not denominated in the entity&#8217;s functional currency. When the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss can result. The resulting adjustment is reflected in Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense), Net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, unless it is intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature or third-party debt that has been designated as a nonderivative net investment hedge and then the adjustment is recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI/L .\n\n&#160;\n\nAcquisitions. We apply a screen test to evaluate if substantially all the fair value of the acquired property is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination. As the fair value of most of our real estate acquisitions is concentrated in either a single or a group of similar identifiable assets, our real estate transactions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions, which permits the capitalization of transaction costs to the basis of the acquired property. We measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged. The difference between the cost and the estimated fair value (excess or bargain consideration) is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. All other assets and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we intend to sell in the next twelve months are recorded at fair value. At a property-level, we allocate the fair value to the components which include building, land, improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases. Purchase price allocations for a business combination are recorded at fair value. \n\n&#160;\n\nWhen we obtain control of an unconsolidated entity and the acquisition qualifies as a business combination, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. We remeasure our previously held interest in the unconsolidated entity at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize any resulting gain or loss in earnings.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe allocate the purchase price using primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs (further defined in Fair Value Measurements below) as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments in Real Estate Properties. We value operating properties as if vacant. We estimate fair value by applying an income approach methodology using either a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated net operating income, defined as rental revenues less rental expenses, of a property. Key assumptions include market rents, growth rates, and discount and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine the discount or capitalization rate by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. At a property level, we allocate the fair value to land and building. \n\n&#160;\n\nLease Intangibles . We determine the portion of the purchase price related to acquired in-place leases as intangible assets and liabilities as follows: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nAbove and Below Market Leases . We recognize an asset or liability for acquired leases with in-place rents that are higher or lower than our estimate of current market rents in each of the applicable markets. The above or below market lease intangibles are valued using a discounted cash flow approach through which we recognize the present value of the difference in cash flows between in-place and market rents. The value is recorded in either Other Assets or Other Liabilities , as appropriate, and is amortized over the remaining term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal options, to rental revenues. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nForegone Rent . We calculate the value of the revenue and recovery of costs which would be foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, if the space was vacant, in each of the applicable markets. The values are recorded in Other Assets and amortized over the remaining life of the respective leases to amortization expense. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLeasing Commissions. We recognize an asset for leasing commissions based on our estimate of the cost to lease space in the applicable markets. The value is recorded in Other Assets and amortized over the remaining life of the respective leases to amortization expense. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities. We estimate the fair value of the entity by using similar valuation methods as those used for the consolidated real estate properties and debt. We apply our ownership percentage to the estimated net asset value of the entity to determine the fair value of our investment. \n\n&#160;\n\nDebt . We estimate the fair value of debt based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and market interest rates that would be available to us for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. In the case of publicly traded debt, we estimate the fair value based on available market data. Any discount or premium to the principal amount is included in the carrying value and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method. \n\n&#160;\n\nNoncontrolling Interests . We estimate the portion of the fair value of the net assets owned by third parties based on the fair value of the consolidated net assets, principally real estate properties and debt. \n\n&#160;\n\nWorking Capital . We estimate the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities using the best information available. \n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements. The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLevel 1 &#8212; Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLevel 2 &#8212; Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nLevel 3 &#8212; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis. We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. We determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using widely accepted valuation techniques. The technique utilized depends on the type of derivative financial instrument being valued, principally foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps, and involves the contractual term of the derivative, observable market-based inputs and implied volatilities. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe determine the fair values of our interest rate swaps using a market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments through a discounted cash flow analysis. We base the variable cash payments on an expectation of future interest rates, or forward curves, derived from observable market interest rate curves through the contractual term of the debt. We determine the fair values of our foreign currency forwards by comparing the contracted forward exchange rate to the current market exchange rate. We build a foreign exchange forward curve to determine the foreign exchange forward rate that pertains to the specific maturity date. Using this foreign exchange forward rate, spot rates and the interest rate curve of the domestic currency as inputs, we calculate the mark-to-market value of the forward.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect nonperformance risk for us and the respective counterparty in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Although the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, we assess the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. \n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis generally consist of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated entities that were subject to impairment charges due to our evaluation of recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As discussed below, our analysis of recoverability is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property \n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nin the near term . We estimate the fair value of our investments based on expected sales prices in the market (Level 2) or by applying the income approach methodology using a discounted cash flow analysis (Level 3). \n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. We estimate the fair value of our senior notes for disclosure purposes based on quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available. We estimate the fair value of our credit facilities, term loans, secured mortgage debt and other debt by discounting the future cash flows using rates and borrowing spreads currently available to us (Level 3). \n\n&#160;\n\nReal Estate Assets. Real estate assets are carried at depreciated cost. We capitalize costs incurred in developing, redeveloping and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. We expense costs for repairs and maintenance as incurred. \n\n&#160;\n\nDepreciation and Amortization. We charge the depreciable portions of real estate assets to depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives. Depreciation on development buildings commences when the asset is ready for its intended use, which we define as the earlier of when a property that was developed has been completed for one year , or is 90 % occupied. We generally use the following useful lives: 5 to 7 years for capital improvements, 10 years for standard tenant improvements, 15 to 25 years for depreciable land improvements, 25 to 40 years for operating properties acquired based on the age of the building and 40 years for operating properties we develop. We depreciate building improvements on land parcels subject to land leases over the shorter of the estimated life of the building improvement or the contractual term of the underlying land lease. Capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the estimated remaining lease term. The weighted average lease term for leases that commenced during 2022, based on square feet, was 69 months. \n\n&#160;\n\nCapitalization of Costs. During the land development and construction periods of qualifying projects, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and general and administrative costs of the personnel performing the development&#59; if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to ready the asset for its intended use. We capitalize transaction costs related to the acquisition of land for future development and operating properties that qualify as asset acquisitions. We capitalize incremental, third-party costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from obtaining a lease and would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of Other Assets and all other capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of the real estate assets. \n\n&#160;\n\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets. We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net operating income from the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt least annually or more frequently given the presence of a triggering event, we measure the recoverability of our assets. We compare the carrying amount of the asset to the fair value based on our intent as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfor real estate properties that we intend to hold long-term&#59; including land held for development, properties currently under development and operating properties&#59; recoverability is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future net operating income from the property and the terminal value, including anticipated costs to develop&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfor real estate properties we intend to sell, including properties currently under development and operating properties&#59; recoverability is assessed based on proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on the future net operating income from the property, expected market capitalization rates and anticipated costs to develop&#59; \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfor land parcels we intend to sell, recoverability is assessed based on the estimated proceeds from disposition&#59; and \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nfor costs incurred related to the potential acquisition of land and operating properties and future development projects, recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur at the measurement date. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAssets Held for Sale or Contribution. We classify a property as held for sale or contribution when certain criteria are met in accordance with GAAP. Assets classified as held for sale are expected to be sold to a third party and assets classified as held for contribution are generally newly developed assets we intend to contribute to an unconsolidated co-investment venture within twelve months. When the criteria are met, the respective assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciation is not recognized. Assets held for sale or contribution are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities. We present our investments in certain entities under the equity method. We use the equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the venture but do not have control of the entity. Under the equity method, we initially recognize these investments (including advances) in the balance sheet at our cost, including formation costs and net of deferred gains from the contribution of properties (recognized prior to January 1, 2018), if applicable. The transaction costs related to the formation of equity method investments are also capitalized. We subsequently adjust the accounts to reflect our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized and accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, distributions received, contributions made, sales and redemptions of our investments and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value. \n\n&#160;\n\nWith regard to distributions from unconsolidated entities, we have elected the nature of distribution approach as the information is available to us to determine the nature of the underlying activity that generated the distributions. In accordance with the nature of distribution approach, cash flows generated from the operations of an unconsolidated entity are classified as a return on investment (cash inflow from operating activities) and cash flows that are generated from property sales, debt refinancing or sales and redemptions of our investments are classified as a return of investment (cash inflow from investing activities). \n\n&#160;\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. We consider all cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We invest our cash with high-credit quality institutions both domestically and internationally. Cash balances may be invested in money market accounts that are not insured. We have not realized any losses of such cash investments or accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk. \n\n&#160;\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest. We may use derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to both our foreign investments and the related earnings. In addition, we occasionally use interest rate swap and forward contracts to manage interest rate risk and limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, primarily with variable-rate debt. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Each derivative transaction is customized and not exchange-traded. We recognize all derivatives at fair value within the line items Other Assets or Other Liabilities . We do not net our derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure. Management reviews our derivative positions, overall risk management strategy and hedging program, on a regular basis. We only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk. Our use of derivatives involves the risk that counterparties may default on a derivative contract&#59; therefore we: (i) establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize this risk and provide counterparty diversification&#59; (ii) contract with counterparties that have long-term credit ratings of single-A or better&#59; (iii) enter into master agreements that generally allow for netting of certain exposures&#59; thereby significantly reducing the actual loss that would be incurred should a counterparty fail to perform its contractual obligations&#59; and (iv) set minimum credit standards that become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. Based on these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.\n\n&#160;\n\nDesignated Derivatives. We may choose to designate our derivative financial instruments, generally foreign currency forwards to hedge our net investment in foreign operations or interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments on variable debt. At inception of the transaction, we formally designate and document the derivative financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. We formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, the effectiveness of our hedging transactions. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative financial instruments will generally be offset by changes in the cash flows or fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. \n\n&#160;\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges of our foreign operations or cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI/L . For net investment hedges, these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments and are recorded in AOCI/L . This includes debt issued in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity that we may designate as a nonderivative net investment hedge. We compare the net equity available from our foreign investments first to the derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges followed by any nonderivative net investment hedges. If the total notional amount of the derivative and nonderivative financial instruments exceeds the net equity available, that excess portion is considered unhedged and the translation of that excess portion is recognized in Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense), Net . \n\n&#160;\n\nFor cash flow hedges, we report the effective portion of the gain or loss as a component of AOCI/ L and reclassify it to the applicable line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, generally Interest Expense , over the corresponding period of the underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument is recognized in earnings, generally Interest Expense , at the time the ineffectiveness occurred. To the extent the hedged forecasted interest payments on debt related to our interest rate swaps is paid off, the remaining balance in AOCI/L is recognized in Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nUndesignated Derivatives. We also use derivatives, such as foreign currency forwards and option contracts, that are not designated as hedges to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the translation of our results of operations. The changes in fair values of these derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings within the line item Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense) , Net . These gains or losses are generally offset by lower or higher earnings due to the translation at exchange rates that were different than our expectations. In addition, we may choose to not designate our interest rate swap contracts . If a swap contract is not designated as a hedge, the changes in fair value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings within the line item Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income . \n\nNoncontrolling Interests. Noncontrolling interests represent the share of consolidated entities owned by third parties. We recognize each noncontrolling holder&#8217;s respective share of the estimated fair value of the net assets at the date of formation or acquisition. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for the noncontrolling holder&#8217;s share of additional contributions, distributions and their share of the net earnings or losses of each respective consolidated entity. We allocate net income to noncontrolling interests based on the weighted average ownership interest during the period. The net income that is not attributable to us is reflected in the line item Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests . We do not recognize a gain or loss on transactions with a consolidated entity in which we do not own 100 % of the equity and recognize the difference between the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the consideration paid or received as additional paid-in-capital .\n\n&#160;\n\nCertain limited partnership interests, including OP units, are exchangeable into our common stock. Common stock issued upon exchange of a holder&#8217;s noncontrolling interest is accounted for at the carrying value of the surrendered limited partnership interest and the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the common stock issued is recorded to additional paid-in-capital.\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue Recognition.\n\nRental Revenues and Recoveries. We lease our operating properties to customers under agreements that are classified as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses are recovered from our customers, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. Rental expenses recovered through reimbursements received from customers are recognized in Rental Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We generally record amounts reimbursed by our customers (&#8220;rental recoveries&#8221;) as revenues in the period that the applicable expenses are incurred. We account for and present rental revenue and rental recoveries as a single component under Rental Revenues as the timing of recognition is the same, the pattern with which we transfer the right of use of the property and related services to the lessee are both on a straight-line basis and our leases qualify as operating leases. We perform credit analyses of our customers prior to the execution of our leases and continue these analyses for each individual lease on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the collectability of rental revenue. We recognize revenue to the extent that amounts are determined to be collectible. \n\n&#160;\n\nStrategic Capital Revenues. Strategic capital revenues include revenues we earn from the management services we provide to unconsolidated entities. These fees are determined in accordance with the terms specific to each arrangement and may include recurring fees such as asset management and property management fees or transactional fees for leasing, acquisition, development, construction, financing and tax services provided. We recognize these fees as we provide the services or on a cost basis for development fees. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe may also earn incentive returns (&#8220;promotes&#8221; or &#8220;promote revenues&#8221;) directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures based on the cumulative returns of the venture over a three-year period or the stabilization of individual development projects owned by the venture. The returns are determined by both the operating performance and real estate valuation of the venture, including highly variable inputs such as capitalization rates, market rents, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As these key inputs are highly volatile and out of our control, and such volatility can materially impact our promotes period over period, we recognize promote revenues at the end of the performance period. We generally earn promote revenue directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures. We include the third-party investors&#8217; share of promotes in Strategic Capital Revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe also earn fees from ventures that we consolidate. Upon consolidation, these fees are eliminated from our earnings and the third-party investors&#8217; share of these fees are recognized as a reduction of Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. \n\n&#160;\n\nDevelopment Management and Other Revenues. Development management and other revenues principally include development and construction management fees from third parties and are recognized as we provide the services or on a cost basis. \n\nGains on Real Estate Transactions, Net. \n\nT hroughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Gains on Real Estate Transactions, Net collectively refers to Gains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net and Gains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net . \n\nWe recognize gains on the disposition of real estate when control transfers to the buyer, generally when consideration and title are exchanged and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer. We recognize losses from the disposition of real estate when known.\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nBeginning January 1, 2018 with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance , we recognize the entire gain attributed to contributions of real estate properties to unconsolidated entities. We previously recognized a gain on contribution only to the extent of the third-party ownership in the unconsolidated entity acquiring the property and deferred the portion of the gain related to our ownership through a reduction to our investment in the applicable unconsolidated entity. We adjusted our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized in future periods to reflect the entities&#8217; recorded depreciation expense as if it were computed on our lower basis in the contributed properties rather than on the entity&#8217;s basis. &#160; For deferred gains from partial sales recorded prior to the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, we continue to recognize these gains over the lives of the underlying real estate properties or at the time of disposition to a third party. If our ownership interest in an unconsolidated entity decreases and the decrease is expected to be permanent, we recognize the amounts relating to previously deferred gains to coincide with our new ownership interest. \n\nGains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net. We present gains separately based on the type of real estate sold or contributed. We present gains on sales to third parties or contributions to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures as Gains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net when the property was included in our land portfolio or when we developed the property with the intent to sell or contribute. \n\nGains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net. We present all other gains on sales to third parties or contributions to our unconsolidated entities of primarily operating properties and other real estate transactions as Gains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net . We also include gains or losses on the remeasurement of equity investments to fair value upon acquisition of a controlling interest if the transaction is considered the acquisition of a business and gains or losses upon the partial redemption or sale of our investment in an unconsolidated entity. \n\n&#160;\n\nRental Expenses. Rental expenses principally include the cost of our property management and leasing personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, real estate taxes and the other costs of managing our properties. We are also a lessee of land under leases which generally meet the criteria to be accounted for as operating leases. \n\n&#160;\n\nStrategic Capital Expenses. Strategic capital expenses generally include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the co-investment ventures provided by our employees who are assigned to our Strategic Capital Segment and the costs of our Prologis Promote Plan (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) based on earned promotes. For further discussion on the PPP, see Note 12. In addition, in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale, all of our property management and leasing functions are provided by property management and leasing personnel who are assigned to our Real Estate Segment. These individuals perform the property-level management and leasing of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio, which includes properties we consolidate and those we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing teams to the properties we consolidate (included in Rental Expenses ) and the properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures (included in Strategic Capital Expenses ) by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios. \n\n&#160;\n\nEquity-Based Compensation. We account for equity-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. We recognize the cost of the award on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period. \n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Taxes. Under the IRC, to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 % of our taxable income, and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests. REITs which meet these certain income, asset and stockholder tests are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute 100 % of their taxable income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Even as a REIT, we may be subject to certain foreign, state and local taxes on our own income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have elected taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. This allows us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs. Many of the foreign countries in which we have operations do not recognize REITs or do not accord REIT status under their respective tax laws to our entities that operate in their jurisdiction. In the U.S., we are taxed in certain states in which we operate. Accordingly, we recognize income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our TRSs, taxes incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions, and interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the Consolidated Financial Statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe recognize deferred income taxes in certain taxable entities. For federal income tax purposes, certain acquisitions have been treated as tax-free transactions resulting in a carry-over tax basis in assets and liabilities. For financial reporting purposes and in accordance with purchase accounting, we record all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair value at date of acquisition, as discussed above. For our taxable subsidiaries, including certain international jurisdictions, we recognize the deferred income tax liabilities that represent the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis carried over and the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets at date of acquisition. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the deferred income tax liability recorded in connection with these acquisitions, are reflected in earnings.\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nIf taxable income is generated in these subsidiaries, we recognize a benefit in earnings as a result of the reversal of the deferred income tax liability previously recorded at the acquisition date and we record current income tax expense representing the entire current income tax liability. If the reversal of the deferred income tax liability results from a sale or contribution of assets, the classification of the reversal to the Consolidated Statement s of Income is based on the taxability of the transaction. If the sale or contribution is of the real estate asset and results in a taxable transaction, the reversal is recorded to deferred income tax benefit. If the sale or contribution is the disposition of the entity that owns the asset, the reversal is recorded through gains. \n\nDeferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period&#8217;s temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes) and the utilization of tax net operating losses (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets. We provide for a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if we believe all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred tax expense.\n\n&#160;\n\nEnvironmental Costs. We incur certain environmental remediation costs, including cleanup costs, consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations, monitoring costs, and legal costs relating to cleanup, litigation defense, and the pursuit of responsible third parties. We expense costs incurred in connection with operating properties and properties previously sold. We capitalize costs related to undeveloped land as development costs and record any expected future environmental liabilities at the time of acquisition. We maintain a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation expected to be incurred in connection with undeveloped land, acquired operating properties and properties previously sold that we adjust as appropriate as information becomes available. \n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS\n\n&#160;\n\nDuke Transaction \n\n&#160;\n\nOn October 3, 2022 , we acquired Duke Realty Corporation and Duke Realty Limited Partnership (collectively &#8220;Duke&#8221; or the &#8220;Duke Transaction&#8221;). Through the Duke Transaction, we acquired a portfolio primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 494 industrial operating properties, aggregating 144.4 million square feet, which are highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential in &#160; our key markets . There was approximately 15 million square feet of non-strategic operating industrial properties acquired in the Duke Transaction for which our intent is not to operate these properties long-term. These assets are classified as Other Real Estate Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The portfolio also included properties under development, land for future development and investments in other ventures. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Duke Transaction was completed for $ 23.2 billion through the issuance of equity based on the value of the Prologis common stock and units issued of $ 18.8 billion, the assumption of debt of $ 4.2 billion and transaction costs. In connection with the transaction, each issued and outstanding share or unit held by a Duke shareholder or unitholder was converted automatically into 0.475 shares of Prologis common stock or common units of Prologis, L.P., respectively, including shares and units under Duke&#8217;s equity incentive plan that became fully vested at closing.\n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nThe aggregate equity consideration is calculated below (in millions, except price per share):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Number of Prologis shares and units issued upon conversion of\n\n&#160; Duke's shares and units at October 3, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n184.80 \n\n&#160;\n\nMultiplied by price of Prologis' common stock on September 30, 2022\n\n$\n\n101.60 \n\n&#160;\n\nFair value of Prologis shares and units issued\n\n$\n\n18,776 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe accounted for the Duke Transaction as an asset acquisition and as a result, the transaction costs of $ 239.8 million were capitalized to the basis of the acquired properties. Transaction costs included the direct costs incurred to acquire the real estate assets. \n\n&#160;\n\nUnder acquisition accounting, the total cost or total consideration exchanged is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. As the fair value of the properties acquired exceeded the purchase price, we allocated the bargain consideration at a property-level based on the relative fair value of the property in comparison to the total portfolio. All other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we intend to sell in the next twelve months were recorded at fair value.

Through the Liberty Transaction, we acquired a portfolio primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 519 industrial operating properties, aggregating 99.6 million square feet. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Liberty Transaction was completed for $ 13.0 billion through the issuance of equity based on the value of the Prologis common stock and units issued of $ 10.0 billion, the assumption of debt of $ 2.8 billion and transaction costs. In connection with the transaction, each issued and outstanding share or unit held by a Liberty stockholder or unitholder was converted automatically into 0.675 shares of Prologis common stock or common units of Prologis, L.P., respectively, including shares and units under Liberty&#8217;s equity incentive plan that became fully vested at closing.\n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nThe aggregate equity consideration is calculated below (in millions, except price per share):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Number of Prologis shares and units issued upon conversion of\n\n&#160; Liberty shares and units at February 4, 2020\n\n&#160;\n\n109.01 \n\n&#160;\n\nMultiplied by price of Prologis' common stock on February 3, 2020\n\n$\n\n91.87 \n\n&#160;\n\nFair value of Prologis shares and units issued\n\n$\n\n10,015 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe accounted for the Liberty Transaction as an asset acquisition and as a result, the transaction costs of $ 115.8 million were capitalized to the basis of the acquired properties.

UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\n\n&#160;\n\nSummary of Investments\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have investments in entities through a variety of ventures. We co-invest in entities that own multiple properties with partners and investors and we provide asset management and property management services to these entities, which we refer to as co-investment ventures. These entities may be consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the structure, our partner&#8217;s participation and other rights and our level of control of the entity. This note details our investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are related parties and accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See Note 11 for more detail regarding our consolidated investments that are not wholly owned.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe also have investments in other ventures, generally with one partner, which we account for using the equity method.

adjusted basis. The difference between our ownership interest of a venture&#8217;s equity and our investment balance at December 31, 2022 and 2021, results principally from four types of transactions: (i) deferred gains from the contribution of property to a venture prior to January 1, 2018 ($ 546.9 million and $ 559.7 million, respectively)&#59; (ii) recording additional costs associated with our investment in the venture ($ 90.4 million and $ 96.6 million, respectively)&#59; (iii) receivables, principally for fees and promotes ($ 193.7 million and $ 149.5 million, respectively)&#59; and (iv) customer security deposits retained subsequent to property contributions to NPR, as discussed above. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (4) \n\nRepresents our weighted average ownership interest in all unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on each entity&#8217;s contribution of total assets before depreciation, net of other liabilities. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nEquity Commitments Related to Certain Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures\n\n&#160;\n\nCertain unconsolidated co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. The commitments are generally used for the acquisition or development of properties but may be used for the repayment of debt or other general uses. The venture may obtain financing for the acquisition of properties and therefore the acquisition price of additional investments that the venture could make may be more than the equity commitment. Depending on market conditions, the investment objectives of the ventures, our liquidity needs and other factors, we may make additional contributions of properties or additional cash investments in these ventures.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our outstanding equity commitments were $ 287.6 million, principally for Prologis China Logistics Venture. &#160; The equity commitments expire from 2023 to 2028 if they have not been previously called. Typically, equity commitments are used for future development and acquisitions in the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. \n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 6.

We also upsized our second global senior credit facility (the &#8220;2021 Global Facility&#8221;), increasing its borrowing capacity to $ 2.0 billion (subject to currency fluctuations). We may draw on both facilities in British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos and U.S. dollars on a revolving basis. During the recast of both facilities, we modified the base rate of the aggregate lender commitments in U.S. dollars from the U.S. dollar London Inter-bank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The 2021 Global Facility is scheduled to initially mature in April 2024 and the 2022 Global Facility in June 2026 &#59; however, we can extend the maturity date for each facility by six months on two occasions, subject to the payment of extension fees. We have the ability to increase the 2021 Global Facility to $ 2.5 billion and the 2022 Global Facility to $ 4.0 billion, subject to currency fluctuations and obtaining additional lender commitments.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe also have a Japanese yen revolver (the &#8220;Yen Credit Facility&#8221;) with total commitments of &#165; 55.0 billion ( $ 417.1 million at December 31, 2022). We have the ability to increase the borrowing capacity of the Yen Credit Facility to &#165; 75.0 billion ( $ 568.7 million at December 31, 2022), subject to obtaining additional lender commitments.

The validly tendered senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by the OP.

All other terms of the assumed Duke senior notes remained substantially the same.\n\n&#160;\n\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt \n\n&#160;\n\nWe repurchased, redeemed or repaid certain debt before the maturity date in an effort to reduce our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities. As a result, the difference between the recorded debt (including premiums, discounts and related debt issuance costs) and the consideration we paid to retire the debt, including fees, was recognized as gains or losses. Fees associated with the restructuring of debt that meets the modification criteria, along with existing unamortized premium or discount and debt issuance costs, are amortized over the term of the new debt . \n\n&#160;\n\nWe recognized $ 20.2 million, $ 187.5 million and $ 188.3 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The losses during 2021 and 2020 were driven by the redemption of certain higher interest rate senior notes before their stated maturity. We redeemed $ 1.5 billion of senior notes in 2021, with stated maturities of 2024 and 2025, and $ 2.6 billion of senior notes in 2020, with stated maturities between 2021 and 2024. The losses in 2020 also included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the Liberty Transaction and IPT Transaction, which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt. \n\n&#160;\n\nTerm Loans \n\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding term loans at December 31 (dollars and borrowing currency in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Term Loan\n\nBorrowing Currency\n\n&#160;\n\nIssuance Date\n\n&#160;\n\nLender Commitment at 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmount Outstanding at 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAmount Outstanding at 2021\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInterest Rate\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMaturity Date\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBorrowing Currency\n\n&#160;\n\nUSD\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nUSD\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nUSD\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2015 Canadian (1) \n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nCAD\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2015 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n134,173 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCDOR + 0.9% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFebruary 2023 \n\nMarch 2017 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 2017 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n12,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n90,994 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n90,994 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n104,243 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.9% and 1.0%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 2027 &#8211; 2028 \n\nOctober 2017 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nOctober 2017 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n10,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n75,828 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n75,828 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n86,869 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.9%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOctober 2032 \n\nDecember 2018 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2018 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n20,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n151,656 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n151,656 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n173,738 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.2% and TIBOR + 0.7%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2031 &#8211; June 2033 \n\nJanuary 2019 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nJanuary 2019 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n15,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n113,742 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n113,742 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n130,304 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTIBOR + 0.5% to 0.6% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJanuary 2028 &#8211; 2030 \n\nMarch 2019 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 2019 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n85,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n644,540 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n644,540 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n738,388 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTIBOR + 0.4% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 2026 \n\nJune 2022 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nJune 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n25,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n189,570 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n189,570 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.1% and 1.2%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJune 2032 - 2034 \n\n2022 Canadian\n\n&#160; Term Loan (1) \n\nCAD\n\n&#160;\n\nAugust 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nC$\n\n300,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n221,593 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n221,593 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCDOR + spread \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAugust 2025 \n\n2022 U.S. Dollar\n\n&#160; Term Loan (2) \n\nUSD\n\n&#160;\n\nOctober 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n500,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n500,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n500,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSOFR + 0.1% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMarch 2025 \n\nDecember 2022 Yen\n\n&#160; Term Loan\n\nJPY\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#165;\n\n15,000,000 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n113,742 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n113,742 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.4% \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDecember 2033 \n\nSubtotal\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,101,665 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,367,715 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDebt issuance costs, net\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 5,007 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 5,169 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal term loans\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2,096,658 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,362,546 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nIn July 2022, we paid down our existing term loan in Canada of CAD $ 170.5 million ($ 133.5 million) and entered into a new term loan in Canada (&#8220;2022 Canadian Term Loan&#8221;) for CAD $ 300.0 million ($ 221.6 million at December 31, 2022), bearing interest at the Canada Dollar Offered Rate (&#8220;CDOR&#8221;) plus a spread over the applicable benchmark.

These entities are 100 % indirectly owned by the OP and all unsecured debt issued or to be issued by each entity is or will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the OP. There are no restrictions or limits on the OP&#8217;s ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.

STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY OF PROLOGIS, INC.\n\n&#160;\n\nShares Authorized\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, 2.1 billion shares were authorized to be issued by the Parent, of which 2.0 billion shares represent common stock and 0.1 billion shares represent preferred stock. Our board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) may, without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our stock from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of such shares.\n\n&#160;\n\nCommon Stock\n\n&#160;\n\nOur at-the-market program allows us to sell up to $ 1.5 billion in aggregate gross sales proceeds of shares of common stock through twenty designated agents. These agents earn a fee of up to 2 % of the gross sales price per share of common stock as agreed to on a transaction-by-transaction basis. We have no t issued any shares of common stock under this program. \n\n&#160;\n\nOn October 3, 2022, we issued 182.7 million common shares in the Duke Transaction. On February 4, 2020, we issued 106.7 million common shares in the Liberty Transaction. See Note 3 for more detail on these transactions.\n\n&#160;\n\nUnder the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan, certain of our employees and outside directors are able to participate in equity-based compensation plans. See Note 12 for additional information on equity-based compensation plans.\n\n&#160;\n\nShare Purchase Program\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have a share purchase program for the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of up to $ 1.0 billion. In 2020, we repurchased and retired 0.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $ 34.8 million at a weighted average price of $ 64.66 per share on the open market. \n\n&#160;\n\nPreferred Stock\n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2020, we repurchased approximately 0.1 million shares of Series Q preferred stock and recognized a loss of $ 2.3 million, which primarily represented the difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred stock, net of original issuance costs.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021 our Series Q preferred stock outstanding had a dividend rate of 8.54 % and will be redeemable at our option on or after November 13, 2026. Holders have, subject to certain conditions, limited voting rights and all holders are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based on liquidation preference. The dividends are payable quarterly when, and if, they have been declared by the Board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends.\n\n&#160;\n\nOwnership Restrictions\n\n&#160;\n\nFor us to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals may not own more than 50 % of the value of our outstanding stock at any time during the last half of our taxable year. Therefore, our charter restricts beneficial ownership (or ownership generally attributed to a person under the REIT rules), by a person, or persons acting as a group, of issued and outstanding common and preferred stock that would cause that person to own or be deemed to own more than 9.8 % (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our issued and outstanding common stock. Furthermore, subject to certain exceptions, no person shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than 25 % of any of the preferred stock. These provisions assist us in protecting and preserving our REIT status and protect the interests of stockholders in takeover transactions by preventing the acquisition of a substantial block of outstanding shares of stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nShares of stock owned by a person or group of people in excess of these limits are subject to redemption by us. The provision does not apply where a majority of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, waives such limit after determining that our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes will not be jeopardized.\n\n&#160;\n\nDividends\n\nTo comply with the REIT requirements of the IRC, we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal (i) the sum of (a) 90 % of our &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and (b) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) certain excess noncash income. Our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the IRC and that allows us to also retain cash to meet other needs, such as capital improvements and other investment activities.\n\nThe taxability of our dividends for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented below. The taxability of dividends paid in 2022 was based on management&#8217;s estimates as our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2022 has not been filed. As the \n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nstatute of limitations is generally three years, our tax returns for certain years remain subject to examination and consequently the taxability of the dividends is subject to change. \n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid all of our dividends in cash. \n\nThe following summarizes the taxability of our common and preferred stock dividends for the years ended December 31: \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2022 (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCommon Stock:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOrdinary income\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3.08 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2.45 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2.12 \n\n&#160;\n\nQualified dividend\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.02 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.00 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.00 \n\n&#160;\n\nCapital gains\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.06 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.07 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.20 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal distribution\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3.16 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2.52 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n2.32 \n\n&#160;\n\nPreferred Stock &#8211; Series Q:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOrdinary income\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4.16 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4.15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3.96 \n\n&#160;\n\nQualified dividend\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.02 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.01 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.02 \n\n&#160;\n\nCapital gains\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.09 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.11 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.29 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal dividend\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4.27 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4.27 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n4.27 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START (1) \n\nTaxability for 2022 is estimated. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nCommon stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income, qualified dividend, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital or a combination of the four. Common stock dividends that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce the stockholder&#8217;s basis in the common stock. To the extent that a dividend exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder&#8217;s basis in the common stock, it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder&#8217;s common stock. At the beginning of each year, we notify our stockholders of the taxability of the common stock dividends paid during the preceding year.\n\n&#160;\n\nPursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 10. PARTNERS&#8217; CAPITAL OF PROLOGIS, L.P.\n\n&#160;\n\nDistributions paid on the common limited partnership units, and the taxability of those distributions, are similar to dividends paid on the Parent&#8217;s common stock disclosed above.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn October 3, 2022, we issued 2.1 million common limited partnership units in the OP in the Duke Transaction. On February 4, 2020, we issued 2.3 million common limited partnership units in the OP in the Liberty Transaction. See Note 3 for more detail on these transactions. Additionally, we issued 1.0 million limited partnership units to our partner as partial consideration for the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an unconsolidated other venture in 2021 and 0.5 million limited partnership units as partial consideration for the acquisition of other properties in 2020. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe issued Class A Units in the OP through an acquisition of a portfolio of properties in 2015. The Class A Units generally have the same rights as the existing common limited partnership units of the OP, except that the Class A Units are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $ 0.64665 per unit so long as the common limited partnership units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $ 0.40 per unit (in the event the common limited partnership units receive a quarterly distribution of less than $0.40 per unit, the Class A Unit distribution would be reduced by a proportionate amount). Class A Units are convertible into common limited partnership units at an initial conversion rate of one-for-one. The conversion rate will be increased or decreased to the extent that, at the time of conversion, the net present value of the distributions paid with respect to the Class A Units are less or more than the distributions paid on common limited partnership units from the time of issuance of the Class A Units until the time of conversion. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Class A Units were convertible into 8.0 million &#160; common limited partnership units. The OP may redeem the Class A Units at any time after October 7, 2025, for an amount in cash equal to the then-current number of the common limited partnership units into which the Class A Units are convertible, multiplied by $ 43.11 , subject to the holders&#8217; right to convert the Class A Units into common limited partnership units. Distributions paid to the Class A Units were $ 2.58660 annually during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 11. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, L.P.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe report noncontrolling interests related to several entities we consolidate but of which we do not own 100% of the equity. These entities include two real estate partnerships that have issued limited partnership units to third parties. Depending on the specific partnership agreements, these limited partnership units are redeemable for cash or, at our option, shares of the Parent&#8217;s common stock, generally at a rate of one share of common stock to one limited partnership unit . We also consolidate certain entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity but the equity of these entities is not exchangeable into our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, the Parent has complete responsibility, power and discretion in the day-to-day management of the OP. The Parent, through its majority interest, has the right to receive benefits from and incur losses of the OP. In addition, the OP does not have either substantive liquidation rights or substantive kick-out rights without cause or substantive participating rights that could be exercised by a simple majority of noncontrolling interests. The absence of such rights renders the OP as a VIE. Accordingly, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP.\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, Inc.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe noncontrolling interests of the Parent include the noncontrolling interests described above for the OP, as well as the limited partnership units in the OP that are not owned by the Parent. The outstanding limited partnership units receive quarterly cash distributions equal to the quarterly dividends paid on our common stock pursuant to the terms of the applicable partnership agreements.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes these entities at December 31 (dollars in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\nOur Ownership Percentage\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNoncontrolling Interests\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal Liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis U.S. Logistics Venture\n\n&#160;\n\n55.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n55.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,182,858 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n3,264,337 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n7,225,438 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n7,397,195 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n158,453 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n147,545 \n\n&#160;\n\nOther consolidated entities (1) \n\nvarious \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nvarious \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n134,909 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n133,201 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,737,311 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,453,236 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n259,524 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n162,598 \n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis, L.P.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,317,767 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n3,397,538 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,962,749 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,850,431 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n417,977 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n310,143 \n\n&#160;\n\nLimited partners in Prologis, L.P.

Also included are the vested OP Long-Term Incentive Plan Units (&#8220;LTIP Units&#8221;) associated with our long-term compensation plans of 4.6 million and 4.0 million shares of the Parent&#8217;s common stock at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See further discussion of LTIP Units in Note 12. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 12. LONG-TERM COMPENSATION\n\n&#160;\n\n2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan \n\n&#160;\n\nIn 2020, our stockholders approved the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (&#8220;2020 LTIP&#8221;), which replaced the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (&#8220;2012 LTIP&#8221;). After approval of the 2020 LTIP, no further awards could be made under the 2012 LTIP and outstanding awards previously granted under the 2012 LTIP will remain outstanding in accordance with the awards&#8217; terms.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe 2020 LTIP provides for grants of awards to officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Parent or its subsidiaries. Awards can be in the form of: full value awards, stock appreciation rights and stock options (non-qualified options and incentive stock options). Full value awards generally consist of: (i) common stock&#59; (ii) restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;)&#59; (iii) OP LTIP units (&#8220;LTIP Units&#8221;) and (iv) Prologis Outperformance Plan (&#8220;POP&#8221;) OP LTIP units (&#8220;POP LTIP Units&#8221;). The equity-based compensation plans and programs under which awards can be made were not changed under the 2020 LTIP. Awards may be made under the 2020 LTIP until it is terminated by the Board or until the ten-year anniversary of the effective date of the plan. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe awards have been issued under the following components of our equity-based compensation plans and programs at December 31, 2022 : (i) POP&#59; (ii) Prologis Promote Plan (&#8220;PPP&#8221;)&#59; (iii) annual long-term incentive (&#8220;LTI&#8221;) equity award program (&#8220;Annual LTI Award&#8221;)&#59; \n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nand (iv) annual bonus exchange program. Under all of these components, certain employees may elect to receive their equity award payout either in the form of RSUs or other equity of the Parent or LTIP Units of the OP. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had 33.3 million shares reserved or available for issuance, including 5.7 million shares of common stock to be issued upon vesting of awards previously granted and 21.0 million shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans. Each LTIP Unit and POP LTIP Unit counts as one share of common stock for purposes of calculating the limit on shares that may be issued.\n\n&#160;\n\nEquity-Based Compensation Plans and Programs \n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis Outperformance Plan (&#8220;POP&#8221;) \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have allocated participation points or a percentage of the compensation pool to participants under our POP corresponding to three-year performance periods beginning every January 1. The fair value of the awards is measured at the grant date and amortized over the period from the grant date to the date at which the awards vest, which ranges from three to ten years . The performance hurdle (&#8220;Outperformance Hurdle&#8221;) at the end of the initial three-year performance period requires our three-year compound annualized total stockholder return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) to exceed a threshold set at the three-year compound annualized TSR for the Morgan Stanley Capital International (&#8220;MSCI&#8221;) US REIT Index for the same period plus 100 basis points. If the Outperformance Hurdle is met, a compensation pool will be formed equal to 3 % of the excess value created, subject to a maximum as defined by each performance period. POP awards cannot be paid at a time when we meet the outperformance hurdle yet our absolute TSR is negative. If after seven years our absolute TSR has not been positive, the awards will be forfeited. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe granted participation points for the 2022 &#8211; 2024 performance period in January 2022, as discussed in the table below. The 2022 &#8211; 2024 performance period has an absolute maximum cap of $ 100 million. If an award is earned at the end of the initial three-year performance period, then 20 % of the POP award is paid at the end of the initial performance period and the remaining 80 % is subject to additional seven-year cliff vesting. The 20% that is paid at the end of the initial three-year performance period is subject to an additional three-year holding requirement. \n\n&#160;\n\nEach participant is eligible to receive a percentage of the total compensation pool based on the number of participation points allocated to the participant, or in the case of certain executive officers, a set percentage of the compensation pool. If the performance criteria are met, the participants&#8217; points or compensation pool percentage will be paid in the form of common stock, restricted stock units, POP LTIP Units or LTIP Units, as elected by the participant. Annually, a participant may exchange their participation points or compensation pool percentage for POP LTIP Units. If the performance criteria are not met, the participants&#8217; points, compensation pool percentage and POP LTIP Units will be forfeited.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022 , all awards were equity classified. The initial valuation was calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table details the assumptions used for each grant based on the year it was granted (dollars in thousands):\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRisk free interest rate\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n0.2 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1.7 \n\n%\n\nPrologis expected volatility\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n31.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n32.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n19.0 \n\n%\n\nMSCI US REIT Index expected volatility\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n29.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n29.0 \n\n%\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n13.0 \n\n%\n\nAggregate fair value\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n30,400 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n30,300 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n28,800 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal remaining compensation cost related to the POP at December 31, 2022, was $ 62.5 million, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development activities.

The initial grant date fair value derived using a Monte Carlo valuation model was used in determining the grant date fair value per unit in the award tables below. \n\n&#160;\n\nOther Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Programs \n\n&#160;\n\nAwards may be issued in the form of RSUs or LTIP Units at the participants&#8217; elections under the following equity-based compensation plans and programs. RSUs and LTIP Units are valued based on the market price of the Parent&#8217;s common stock on the date the award is granted and the grant date value is charged to compensation expense over the service period. The service period is generally four years , except for awards under the annual bonus exchange program. Dividends and distributions are paid with respect to both RSUs and LTIP Units during the vesting period, and therefore they are considered participating securities. We do not allocate undistributed earnings to participating securities as our net earnings per share or unit would not be materially different. The value of the dividend is charged to retained earnings for RSUs and the distribution is charged to Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in the OP for LTIP Units in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent. \n\n&#160;\n\nPrologis Promote Plan (&#8220;PPP&#8221;)\n\n&#160;\n\nUnder the PPP, we establish a compensation pool for certain employees up to 40 % of the third-party portion of promotes earned by Prologis from the co-investment ventures. The awards may be settled in some combination of cash and full value awards, at our election. \n\n&#160;\n\nAnnual LTI Equity Award Program (&#8220;Annual LTI Award&#8221;)\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Annual LTI Award provides for grants to certain employees subject to our performance against benchmark indices that relate to the most recent year&#8217;s performance. \n\n&#160;\n\nAnnual Bonus Exchange Program\n\n&#160;\n\nUnder our bonus exchange program, generally all our employees may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual cash bonus in equity. Equity awards granted through the bonus exchange are valued at a premium to the cash bonus exchanged and vest over three years, excluding certain executive officers. As certain executive officers do not receive a bonus exchange premium for participating in the bonus exchange program, the equity they receive upon exchange for their cash bonuses does not have a vesting period.\n\n&#160;\n\nSummary of Award Activity \n\n&#160;\n\nRSUs\n\n&#160;\n\nEach RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock of the Parent. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022 (units in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nUnvested RSUs\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\n\n&#160;\n\nBalance at January 1, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,237 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n87.87 \n\n&#160;\n\nGranted\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n118.05 \n\n&#160;\n\nVested and distributed\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 502 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n96.74 \n\n&#160;\n\nForfeited\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 40 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n121.42 \n\n&#160;\n\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,533 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n100.59 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe fair value of stock awards granted and vested was $ 98.9 million and $ 48.6 million for 2022, respectively, and $ 74.5 million and $ 32.6 million for 2021 respectively, based on the weighted average grant date fair value per unit.\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal remaining compensation cost related to RSUs outstanding, excluding POP, at December 31, 2022, was $ 90.9 million, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development activities.

The matching employer contribution was previously up to 6 % of the employee&#8217;s annual compensation. In the 401(k) Plan, vesting in the matching employer contributions is based on the employee&#8217;s years of service, with 100 % vesting at the completion of one year of service. Our contributions under the matching provisions were $ 8.1 million, $ 5.8 million and $ 5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have a non-qualified savings plan that allows highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer the receipt and income taxation of a certain portion of their compensation in excess of the amount permitted under the 401(k) Plan. There has been no employer matching within this plan in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 13.

Current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. Taxable income incurred over the last three years was principally due to the following: (i) the contribution of real estate properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and sales to third parties&#59; (ii) recurring and transactional strategic capital fees earned&#59; and (iii) taxable earnings from unconsolidated co-investment ventures. For 2021 and 2020, we had higher current tax expense in the U.S. primarily due to the tax incurred on the sale of assets. Included in 2022 is the reversal of a liability for an uncertain tax position, related to a previous acquisition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $ 130.0 million, $ 148.7 million and $ 100.7 million, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred Income Taxes\n\n&#160;\n\nThe deferred income tax expense recognized in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to changes in temporary differences and utilization of NOLs. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table summarizes the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nGross deferred income tax assets:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNOL carryforwards\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n229,410 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n272,713 \n\n&#160;\n\nBasis difference &#8211; real estate properties\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n94,610 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n99,984 \n\n&#160;\n\nBasis difference &#8211; equity investments\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n17,042 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n8,462 \n\n&#160;\n\nSection 163(j) interest limitation\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,218 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,599 \n\n&#160;\n\nCapital loss carryforward\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n6,903 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n14,238 \n\n&#160;\n\nOther &#8211; temporary differences\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,250 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n10,027 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal gross deferred income tax assets\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n359,433 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n407,023 \n\n&#160;\n\nValuation allowance\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 295,834 \n\n)\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n( 337,587 \n\n)\n\nGross deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n63,599 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n69,436 \n\n&#160;\n\nGross deferred income tax liabilities:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis difference &#8211; real estate properties\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n116,102 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n104,292 \n\n&#160;\n\nBasis difference &#8211; equity investments\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n40,333 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n30,276 \n\n&#160;\n\nOther &#8211; temporary differences\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,189 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal gross deferred income tax liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n157,624 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n135,517 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet deferred income tax liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n94,025 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n66,081 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had NOL carryforwards as follows (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\nU.S.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nEurope\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nMexico\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nJapan\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOther\n\n&#160;\n\nGross NOL carryforward\n\n$\n\n68,491 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n564,972 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n161,964 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n62,563 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n36,810 \n\n&#160;\n\nTax-effected NOL carryforward\n\n&#160;\n\n17,415 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n142,330 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n51,290 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,258 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,117 \n\n&#160;\n\nValuation allowance\n\n&#160;\n\n16,811 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n137,055 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n51,290 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,258 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n9,117 \n\n&#160;\n\nNet deferred tax asset &#8211; NOL carryforward\n\n$\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n5,275 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n- \n\n&#160;\n\nExpiration periods\n\n2023 &#8211; 2042 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2023 &#8211; indefinite \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2023 &#8211; 2033 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2023 &#8211; 2032 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2023 &#8211; indefinite \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe deferred tax asset valuation allowance at December 31, 2022, was adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized. \n\n&#160;\n\nLiability for Uncertain Tax Positions\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we believe that we had complied with the REIT requirements of the IRC.

Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. See Note 2 for more information on our fair value measurements policy.\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, other than the derivatives discussed previously, we had no significant financial assets or financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our derivatives held at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value Measurements on Nonrecurring Basis\n\n&#160;\n\nAcquired properties and assets we expect to sell or contribute are significant nonfinancial assets that met the criteria to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as detailed in our accounting policy in Note 2. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we estimated the fair value of our properties using Level 2 or Level 3 inputs from the fair value hierarchy. See more information on our acquired properties in Notes 3 and 4 and assets held for sale or contribution in Note 6.\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\n&#160;\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value in the table below were the result of differences in interest rates or borrowing spreads that were available to us at December 31, 2022 and 2021, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or assumed, including reduced borrowing spreads due to our improved credit ratings. The fair value of the senior notes decreased in 2022 due to the increase in bond yields in the market as compared to the weighted average interest rates on our senior notes. The senior notes and many of the issuances of secured mortgage debt contain prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so. We evaluate this on an on-going basis and have taken the opportunity to refinance some of our debt at lower rates and longer maturities as discussed in Note 8.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt at December 31 (in thousands): \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCarrying Value\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCarrying Value\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFair Value\n\n&#160;\n\nCredit Facilities\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,538,461 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,538,461 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n491,393 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n491,429 \n\n&#160;\n\nSenior notes\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n19,786,253 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n16,604,241 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n14,981,690 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n15,151,781 \n\n&#160;\n\nTerm loans and unsecured other\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,106,592 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,092,264 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,825,195 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n1,835,569 \n\n&#160;\n\nSecured mortgage\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n444,655 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n420,964 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n416,776 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n437,215 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n23,875,961 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n20,655,930 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n17,715,054 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n17,915,994 \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n&#160;\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\n&#160;\n\nA majority of the properties we acquire, including land, are subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. In addition, we may incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the development of the land. We have acquired certain properties that may have been leased to or previously owned by companies that discharged hazardous materials. We establish a liability at the time of acquisition to cover such costs and adjust the liabilities as appropriate when additional information becomes available. We record our environmental liabilities in Other Liabilities . We purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIndemnification Agreements\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have entered into agreements whereby we indemnify certain co-investment ventures, or our venture partners, outside of the U.S. for taxes that may be assessed with respect to certain properties we contributed to these ventures. Our contributions to these ventures are generally structured as contributions of shares of companies that own the real estate assets. Accordingly, the capital gains associated with the step up in the value of the underlying real estate assets, for tax purposes, are deferred and transferred at contribution. We have generally indemnified these ventures to the extent that the ventures incur capital gains or withholding tax as a result of a direct sale. The agreements limit the amount that is subject to our indemnification with respect to each property to 100 % of the actual tax liabilities related to the capital gains that are deferred and transferred by us to the ventures at the time of the initial contribution less any deferred tax assets transferred with the property.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe outcome under these agreements is uncertain as it depends on the method and timing of dissolution of the related venture or disposition of any properties by the venture. We record liabilities related to the indemnification agreements in Other Liabilities . We continue to monitor these agreements and the likelihood of the sale of assets that would result in recognition and will adjust the potential liability in the future as facts and circumstances dictate.\n\n&#160;\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Liabilities\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have issued performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit in connection with certain development projects. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire on the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 456.0 million and $ 394.6 million, respectively, outstanding under such arrangements.\n\nWe may be required under capital commitments or we may choose to make additional capital contributions to certain of our unconsolidated entities, representing our proportionate ownership interest, should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund development or acquisition costs, repayment of debt or operational shortfalls. See Note 5 for further discussion related to equity commitments to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nLitigation \n\nFrom time to time, we are party to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not have material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nNOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n&#160;\n\nOur current business strategy includes two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. We generate revenues, earnings, net operating income and cash flows through our segments, as follows:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nReal Estate Segment. This operating segment represents the ownership and development of operating properties and is the largest component of our revenue and earnings. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. Each operating property is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics&#59; these properties are combined within the reportable business segment based on geographic location. The Real Estate Segment also includes development activities that lead to rental operations, including land held for development and properties currently under development, and other real estate investments. Within this line of business, we utilize the following: (i) our land bank&#59; (ii) the development and leasing expertise of our local teams&#59; and (iii) our customer relationships. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8226; \n\nStrategic Capital Segment. This operating segment represents the management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We generate strategic capital revenues primarily from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing and disposition services. Depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners, we also earn revenues through promotes periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. Each unconsolidated co-investment venture we manage is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics&#59; these ventures are combined within the reportable business segment based on geographic location. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nReconciliations are presented below for: (i) each reportable business segment&#8217;s revenues from external customers to Total Revenues &#59; (ii) each reportable business segment&#8217;s net operating income from external customers to Operating Income and Earnings Before Income Taxes &#59; and (iii) each reportable business segment&#8217;s assets to Total Assets . Our chief operating decision makers rely primarily on net operating income and similar measures to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing segment performance. The applicable components of Total Revenues, Operating Income, Earnings Before Income Taxes and Total Assets are allocated to each reportable business segment&#8217;s revenues, net operating income and assets. Items that are not directly assignable to a segment, such as certain corporate income and expenses, are not allocated but reflected as reconciling items.\n\n&#160; Index to Item 15 \n\n&#160;\n\nThe
