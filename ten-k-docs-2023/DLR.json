(the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221; or the &#8220;OP&#8221;) and the subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, (collectively, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leading global provider of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions for customers across a variety of industry verticals. The Parent operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The OP is the entity through which the Parent conducts its business of owning, acquiring, developing and operating data centers. The Parent was incorporated in the state of Maryland on March 9, 2004. The OP was organized as a limited partnership in the state of Maryland on July 21, 2004.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of 316 data centers (including 59 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated entities), of which 132 are located in the United States, 114 are located in Europe, 34 are located in Latin America, 14 are located in Africa, 13 are located in Asia, six are located in Australia and three are located in Canada.\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 5707 Southwest Parkway, Building 1, Suite 275, Austin, Texas 78735. Our telephone number is (737) 281-0101. Our website is www.digitalrealty.com. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, nor does it form a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRecent Acquisitions\n\nOn August 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of 61.1% indirect controlling interest in Teraco Data Environments (Pty) Ltd., (&#8220;Teraco&#8221;), a leading carrier-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa. The total purchase price was $1.7 billion cash, funded by our global revolving credit facility and partial settlement of our forward equity sale agreements. Teraco&#8217;s financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements and associated notes to those financial statements. \n\nIndustry Background\n\nThe digital economy continues to grow and change how enterprises across all industries create and deliver value. Companies increasingly need to operate ubiquitously, on-demand and with real-time intelligence serving customers, partners and employees across multiple channels, business functions and points of business presence. Computational processing power requirements continue to advance, data traffic is growing, and the volume of data that enterprises generate, transmit, process, analyze, monitor and manage is expanding dramatically. The Internet of Things, 5G, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, among other technological advancements, are driving this digital transformation.\n\nWe believe that enterprise data growth is accelerating due to the growing digital economy and emerging technological advances. As enterprises analyze and process this accelerating data mass, they create more data. As this mass of data continues to grow, it needs to be analyzed and processed: a task which we believe is becoming increasingly challenging to replicate and relocate. This phenomenon is called Data Gravity. We believe that enterprise decisionmakers will need to increasingly consider the impact of how Data Gravity impacts their enterprise IT architectures and, accordingly, we have developed the Data Gravity Index: a global forecast that measures the intensity and gravitational force of enterprise data growth.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs the largest global provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, we believe the data center industry is poised for sustainable growth. The demand for data center infrastructure is being driven by this digital transformation which is contributing to the explosive growth of data, rapid growth of cloud adoption and greater demand for IT outsourcing. The power requirements and financial costs to support this growth in data, traffic and storage are substantial and growing accordingly. We believe data centers will continue to play a critical role in the digital economy and enabling business transformation strategies.\n\nWe believe cloud solutions and hybrid cloud solutions will remain significant drivers of demand for data center infrastructure. The hybrid cloud, which combines public and private cloud solutions, has gained traction because it enables corporate enterprises to achieve efficiencies and contain costs, as well as scale and secure their most sensitive information. In addition, the leading cloud service providers are generally mature, well-capitalized technology companies, and cloud platforms are among the fastest-growing business segments. Data center providers that can solve global coverage, capacity and connectivity needs, and coordinate and aggregate diverse customer and application demand, are poised to benefit from these cloud-specific industry drivers.\n\nThese diverse and secular industry dynamics are driving greater demand for data center capacity not only from global cloud service providers, but also from businesses across other industries, including IT service firms, social media, content providers and the financial services sector. As companies focus on their core competencies and rely on outsourcing to meet their IT infrastructure needs, they are prioritizing colocation for their data center solutions for various reasons, including to reduce latency in data transfer and increase global presence and connectivity. New technologies need a fast, reliable and flexible foundation to operate, and the importance of offering a full spectrum of power, space and connectivity solutions on a global platform continues to grow.\n\nOur Business\n\nWe provide a global data center platform that supports our customers&#8217; digital infrastructure and enables our customers to interconnect with their customers and partners. We solve global coverage, capacity and connectivity needs for companies of all sizes, including the world&#8217;s leading enterprises and services providers, through PlatformDIGITAL&#174;, a global data center platform for scaling digital business which enables customers to deploy their critical infrastructure with a global data center provider.\n\nPlatformDIGITAL&#174; combines our global presence with our Pervasive Data Center Architecture (PDx&#174;) solution methodology for scaling digital business and efficiently managing data gravity challenges. Our global data center footprint gives customers access to the connected data communities that matter to them with over 300 facilities in 54 metropolitan areas across 28 countries on six continents. \n\nFundamentally, we bring together foundational real estate and innovative technology expertise around the world to deliver a comprehensive, dedicated product suite to meet customers&#8217; data and connectivity needs. We represent an important part of the digital economy that we believe will benefit from powerful, long-term growth drivers.\n\nWe believe that the growth trends in the data center market, technology, the cloud, internet traffic and internet-based services, combined with cost advantages in outsourcing data center requirements, provide attractive growth opportunities for us as a data center solutions provider. Leveraging deep expertise in technology and real estate, we have an expansive global footprint, impressive scale and a full-spectrum fit-for-purpose product offering in key metropolitan areas around the world. These advantages simplify the contracting process for multinational enterprises, eliminating their need to negotiate with multiple local data center solutions providers. In addition, in areas where high data center construction and operating costs and long time-to-market prohibit many of our customers from building their own data centers, our global footprint and scale allow us to meet our customers&#8217; needs quickly and efficiently.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur Data Center Portfolio\n\nOur portfolio of high-quality data centers provides secure, highly connected and continuously available environments for the exchange, processing and storage of critical data. Data centers are used for digital communication, disaster recovery purposes, transaction processing and housing mission-critical corporate IT applications. Our internet gateway data centers are highly connected, network-dense facilities that serve as hubs for internet and data communications within and between major metropolitan areas. We believe internet gateways are extremely valuable, and a high-quality, highly interconnected global portfolio such as ours could not be easily replicated today on a cost-competitive basis.\n\nWe are diversified across major metropolitan areas characterized by a high concentration of connected end-users and technology companies. At December 31, 2022, we owned or had investments in properties, on a wholly-owned basis or through unconsolidated entities, in the following geographies: \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur portfolio contained a total of approximately 50.8 million rentable square feet including approximately 9.2 million square feet of space under active development and 3.4 million square feet of space held for development. The 59 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated entities had an aggregate of approximately 38.2 million rentable square feet. The 30 parcels of developable land we owned comprised approximately 842 acres. \n\nA significant component of our current and future growth is expected to be generated through the development of our existing space held for future development and acquisition of new properties. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio, including the 59 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated entities, was approximately 84.7% leased. From time to time, we may look to sell individual assets or portfolios that we do not consider to be core to our business and growth strategy.\n\nThrough strategic investments, we have expanded our footprint into Latin America, enhanced our data center offerings in strategic and complementary U.S. metropolitan areas, established our colocation and interconnection platform in the U.S. and expanded our colocation and interconnection platform in Europe and Africa, with each transaction enhancing our presence in top-tier locations throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Africa. In addition, on August 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of a majority interest in Teraco, the largest and most densely interconnected data center platform in South Africa, with an in-service portfolio of seven state-of-the-art data centers strategically located in the key South African metro areas of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban. In addition, we are investing in our portfolio to organically expand our capacity. As of December 31, 2022, we had 49 projects underway in 26 metropolitan areas around the world, and 58.5% percent of this data center activity is pre-leased. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe locations of and improvements to our data centers, the network density, interconnection infrastructure and connectivity-centric customers in certain of our facilities, and our comprehensive product offerings are critical to our customers&#8217; businesses, which we believe results in high occupancy levels, longer average lease terms and customer relationships, as well as lower turnover. In addition, many of our data centers contain significant improvements that have been installed at our customers&#8217; expense. The tenant improvements in our data centers are generally readily adaptable for use by similar customers.\n\nOur data centers are physically secure, network-rich and equipped to meet the power and cooling requirements of smaller footprints up to the most demanding IT applications. Many of our data centers are located on major aggregation points formed by the physical presence of multiple major telecommunications service providers, which reduces our customers&#8217; costs and operational risks and enhances the attractiveness of our properties. In addition, our strategically located global data center campuses offer our customers the ability to expand their global footprint as their businesses grow, while our connectivity offerings on our campuses enhance the capabilities and attractiveness of these facilities. Further, the network density, interconnection infrastructure and connectivity-centric customers in certain of our data centers have led to the organic formation of densely connected data communities that are difficult for competitors to replicate and deliver added value to our customers.\n\nOur Diversified Product Offerings\n\nWe provide a flexible, global data center platform that allows our customers to tailor infrastructure deployments and controls matched to their business needs. Our data centers and comprehensive suite of product offerings are scalable to meet our customers&#8217; needs, from a single rack or cabinet up to multi-megawatt deployments, along with connectivity, connected data communities and solutions to support their hybrid cloud architecture requirements. Over the past few years, we have expanded our product mix to appeal to a broader spectrum of data center customers, especially those seeking to support a greater portion of their data center requirements through a single provider. Our Critical Facilities Management &#174; services and team of technical engineers and data center operations experts provide 24/7 support for these mission-critical facilities.\n\n&#8203; \n\nPlatformDIGITAL&#174; Solution Model . The PlatformDIGITAL&#174; solution model is based on our Pervasive Data Center Architecture (PDx&#174;) strategy, which brings users, networks, clouds, controls and systems to the data, removing barriers, creating centers of data exchange to accommodate distributed workflows and scaling digital business.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nNetwork Hub \n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidates and localizes traffic into ingress/egress points to optimize network performance and cost\n\nControl Hub \n\n&#160;\n\nHosts adjacent security and IT controls to improve security posture and Hybrid-IT operations\n\nData Hub \n\n&#160;\n\nLocalizes data aggregation, staging, analytics, streaming and data management to optimize data exchange\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nCapacity \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START Product Types \n\n&#160;\n\nDescription \n\n0 to 1 MW \n\n(Colocation)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nSmall (one cabinet) to medium (75 cabinets) deployments\n\nProvides agility to quickly deploy in days\n\nContract length generally 2-5 years\n\nConsistent designs, operational environment, power expenses\n\n&#62; 1 MW\n\n(Scale &#38; Hyperscale\n\nPowered Base Building &#174; \n\nTurn-Key Flex &#174; ) \n\n&#160;\n\nScale from medium to very large deployments\n\nSolution can be executed in weeks\n\nContract length generally 5-10+ years\n\nCustomized data center environment for specific deployment needs\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe PlatformDIGITAL &#174; solution model is available in our colocation and Turn-Key Flex &#174; data centers, which are move-in ready, physically secure facilities with the power and cooling capabilities to support customers requiring a single rack or cabinet up to multi-megawatt deployments. We believe our colocation and Turn-Key Flex &#174; facilities are effective solutions for customers who may lack the bandwidth, capital budget, expertise or desire to provide their own extensive data center infrastructure, management and security. We believe our offerings are also well-suited for those customers who seek to efficiently exchange data with others in our connected data communities lowering their costs and creating value for their business. For customers who possess the ability to build and operate their own facility, our Powered Base Building &#174; solution provides the physical location, requisite power and network access necessary to support a state-of-the-art data center.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAdditionally, our data center campuses offer our customers the opportunity to expand in or near their existing deployments within our data center campuses.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nConnectivity \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nProduct \n\n&#160;\n\nDescription \n\nCross Connect\n\n&#160;\n\nA physical connection between two customer defined end points in a Digital Realty facility enabling customers to directly exchange data traffic\n\nCampus Connect\n\n&#160;\n\nLocal, dedicated connectivity solution within Digital Realty campus environments located in hyperconnected metros around the world enabling multiple facilities on a single campus to exchange data traffic and therefore operate as a virtual single data center\n\nMetro Connect\n\n&#160;\n\nDedicated connection between multiple Digital Realty facilities located in the same metro area enabling fast connectivity for data traffic between them\n\nInterxion Cloud Connect\n\n&#8203; \n\nProvides secure and high-performance VLAN interconnections to multiple cloud service providers from one physical connection\n\nInternet Exchange\n\n&#160;\n\nA common peering platform allowing participants to exchange network traffic with multiple ISPs, CDNs and other parties over a single port interface\n\nServiceFabric&#8482;\n\n&#160;\n\nA global open orchestration platform enabling customers to easily provision global connectivity and orchestrate connected services across Digital Realty&#8217;s worldwide data center footprint and in third party locations\n\nIP Bandwidth\n\n&#160;\n\nDedicated Internet Access using blend of ISPs.

We believe interconnection is an attractive line of business that would be difficult to build organically and enhances the overall value proposition of our data center product offerings. Through product offerings such as our ServiceFabric&#8482; and Interxion Cloud Connect and partnerships with cloud service providers, we can support our customers&#8217; hybrid cloud architecture requirements.\n\nOur Global Customers\n\nOur portfolio has attracted a high-quality, diversified mix of customers. We have more than 4,000 customers, and no single customer represented more than approximately 10.2% of the aggregate annualized recurring revenue of our portfolio as of December 31, 2022. We provide each customer access to a choice of highly customized solutions based on their scale, colocation, and interconnection needs.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nGlobal Customer Base across a Wide Variety of Industry Sectors . We use our in-depth knowledge of requirements for and trends impacting cloud and information technology service providers, content providers, network and communications providers, and other data center users, including enterprise customers, to market our data centers to meet these customers&#8217; specific technology needs. Our customers are increasingly launching multi-regional deployments and growing with us globally. Our largest customer, accounted for approximately 10.2% of our aggregate annualized recurring revenue as of December 31, 2022. No other single customer accounted for more than approximately 3.6% of the aggregate annualized recurring revenue of our portfolio. Our customers represent a variety of industry verticals, ranging from cloud and information technology services, communications and social networking to financial services, manufacturing, energy, gaming, life sciences and consumer products.\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCloud and IT Services \n\n&#8203; \n\nDigital Content Providers and Financial Companies \n\n&#8203; \n\nNetwork and Mobile Services \n\nFortune 50 Software Company\n\n&#8203; \n\nFortune 25 Investment Grade-Rated Company\n\n&#8203; \n\nAT&#38;T\n\nGlobal Cloud Provider\n\n&#8203; \n\nJPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.\n\n&#8203; \n\nComcast Corporation\n\nIBM\n\n&#8203; \n\nLinkedIn Corporation\n\n&#8203; \n\nLumen Technologies, Inc.\n\nOracle Corporation\n\n&#8203; \n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\n\n&#8203; \n\nVerizon\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nProven Experience Attracting and Retaining Customers . Our specialized data center salesforce, which is aligned to meet our customers&#8217; needs for global, enterprise and network solutions, provides a robust pipeline of new customers, while existing customers continue to grow and expand their utilization of our technology-enabled services to support a greater portion of their IT needs.\n\nOur Design, Engineering and Construction Program \n\nOur extensive development activity, operating scale and process-based approach to data center design and construction result in significant cost savings and added value for our customers. We have leveraged our purchasing power by securing global purchasing agreements and developing relationships with major equipment manufacturers, reducing costs and shortening delivery timeframes on key components, including major mechanical and electrical equipment. See \"We and our customers may experience supply chain or procurement disruptions, or increased supply chain costs, which may lead to delays.\" in Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion. Utilizing our innovative modular data center design, we deliver what we believe to be a technically superior data center environment at significant cost savings and reduced timeframes. Our access to capital and investment-grade ratings allow us to provide data center solutions for customers who do not want to invest their own capital.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur Investment Approach\n\nWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating acquisitions and investments, including income-producing properties as well as vacant buildings and land suitable for development, to ensure that they meet our strategic, financial, technical and other criteria. These procedures, together with our in-depth knowledge of the technology, data center and real estate industries, allow us to identify strategically located properties and evaluate investment opportunities efficiently and, as appropriate, commit and close quickly. Our investment-grade ratings, along with our broad network of contacts within the data center industry, enable us to effectively capitalize on acquisition and investment opportunities.\n\nOur Management Team and Organization\n\nOur senior management team has many years of experience in the technology and/or real estate industries, including experience as investors in and advisors to technology companies. We believe that our senior management team&#8217;s extensive knowledge of both the technology and the real estate industries provides us with a key competitive advantage. Further, a significant portion of compensation for our senior management team and directors is in the form of common equity interests in our Company. We also maintain minimum stock ownership requirements for our senior management team and directors, further aligning their interests with those of external stockholders, as well as an employee stock purchase plan, which encourages our employees to increase their ownership in the Company.\n\nOur Business and Growth Strategies\n\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our Operating Partnership&#8217;s unitholders through the payment of dividends and distributions and (iii) return on invested capital. We expect to accomplish these objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying our product offerings, accelerating our global reach and scale, and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies.\n\nSuperior Risk-Adjusted Returns . We believe that achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns on our business, including on our development pipeline and leasing transactions, will deliver superior stockholder returns. We may continue to build out our development pipeline when justified by anticipated returns. We have established robust internal guidelines for reviewing and approving leasing transactions, which we believe will drive risk-adjusted returns. We also believe that providing an even stronger value proposition to our customers, including new and more comprehensive product offerings, as well as continuing to improve operational efficiencies, will further drive improved returns for our business.\n\nPrudently Allocate Capital . We believe that the strategic deployment of capital at sufficiently positive spreads above our cost of capital enables us to increase cash flow and create long-term stockholder value.\n\nStrategic and Complementary Investments. We have developed significant expertise at underwriting, financing and executing data center investment opportunities. We employ a collaborative approach to deal analysis, risk management and asset allocation, focusing on key elements, such as market fundamentals, accessibility to fiber and power, and the local regulatory environment. In addition, the specialized nature of data centers makes these investment opportunities more difficult for traditional real estate investors to underwrite, resulting in reduced competition for investments relative to other property types. We believe this dynamic creates an opportunity for us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on our capital.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nPreserve the Flexibility of Our Balance Sheet. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our goal is to average through business cycles the following financial ratios: 1) a debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5x, 2) a fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and 3) floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. In addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost. Since Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s initial public offering in 2004, we have raised approximately $59 billion of capital through common (excluding forward contracts), preferred and convertible preferred equity offerings, exchangeable debt offerings, non-exchangeable bond offerings, our global revolving credit facilities, our term loan facilities, a senior notes shelf facility, secured mortgage financings and re-financings, joint venture partnerships and the sale of non-core assets. We endeavor to maintain financial flexibility while using our liquidity and access to capital to support operations, our acquisition, investment, leasing and development programs and global campus expansion, which are important sources of our growth.\n\nLeverage Technology to Develop Comprehensive and Diverse Products. We believe we have one of the most comprehensive suites of global data center solutions available to customers from a single provider.\n\nGlobal Service Infrastructure Platform . With our recent acquisitions, which extended our footprint further across Latin America, Europe and Africa, enhanced our portfolio of scale and hyper-scale data centers in the U.S. and furthered our position as a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enablement services globally, we are able to offer one of the industry&#8217;s broadest range of data center solutions to meet our customers&#8217; needs, from a single rack or cabinet to multi-megawatt deployments. We believe our products like ServiceFabric&#8482; and our partnerships with managed services and cloud service providers further enhance the attractiveness of our data centers.\n\nProvide Foundational Services to Enable Customers and Partners. We believe that the platform, through which we offer the foundational services of space, power and connectivity, will enable our customers and partners to serve their customers and grow their businesses. We believe our Internet gateway data centers, individual data centers and data center campuses are attractive to a wide variety of customers and partners of all sizes. Furthermore, we believe our colocation and interconnection offerings, as well as the densely connected data communities that have developed within our facilities, and the availability and scalability of our comprehensive suite of products are valuable and critical to our customers and partners.\n\nAccelerate Global Reach and Scale. We have strategically pursued international expansion since our IPO in 2004 and now operate across six continents. We believe that our global multi-product data center portfolio is a foundational element of our strategy and our scale and global platform represent key competitive advantages difficult to replicate. Customers and competitors are recognizing the value of interconnected scale, which aligns with our connected campus strategy that enables customers to &#8220;land and expand&#8221; with us. We expect to continue to source and execute strategic and complementary transactions to strengthen our data center portfolio, expand our global footprint and product mix, and enhance our scale. \n\nDrive Revenue Growth and Operating Efficiencies. We aggressively manage our properties to maximize cash flow and control costs by leveraging our scale to drive operating efficiencies.\n\nLeverage Strong Industry Relationships. Our global market leadership position and strong industry relationships provide us with a unique vantage point to detect and capitalize on secular trends as they emerge globally. We focus our industry relationship efforts towards market sensing, market shaping and helping to set open standards that benefit companies of all types to derive value from digital infrastructure and multi-tenant datacenters. Industry collaboration includes engagements with industry associations, IT industry analysts, venture capitalists, technology incubators, technology service providers, telecommunications providers, systems integrators and large multi-national companies across segments including manufacturing, transportation &#38; logistics, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and digital media. These relationships help us forge new product capabilities, inform investment decisions, develop new routes to market and create differentiated value for customers and drive long-term growth and yield for shareholders.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nMaximize Cash Flow. We often acquire operating properties with substantial in-place cash flow and some vacancy, which enables us to create upside through lease-up. We control our costs by negotiating expense pass-through provisions in customer agreements for operating expenses, including power costs and certain capital expenditure. We have also focused on centralizing functions and optimizing operations as well as improving processes and technologies. We believe that expanding our global data center campuses will also contribute to operating efficiencies because we expect to achieve economies of scale on our campus environments.\n\nSustainability. We believe that addressing sustainability by driving environmental efficiency through the implementation of cost-effective design features and the use of carbon-free and renewable energy serves as a key differentiator enabling us to deliver products that help attract and retain customers, generate cash flow, and manage operational risks. In 2022, for the sixth consecutive year, we received the Nareit &#8220;Leader in the Light&#8221; award for data centers, recognizing our sustainability and energy-efficiency achievements. In 2022, we allocated &#8364;753 million in net proceeds from our green bonds to green buildings, energy efficiency improvements, and renewable energy. \n\nThe Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard guidance, issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;SASB&#8221;), outlines proposed disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry. We provide data on energy and water management metrics that we believe best correlate with our business and industry as indicated in the following sections.

We may also certify certain properties in accordance with recognized sustainable operations standards. Our data center space receiving third-party sustainable ratings in 2022 totaled 753,400 square feet. We received the following sustainable data center ratings for the following sites:\n\n##TABLE_START \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START Data Center \n\nMetropolitan Area \n\nRating System \n\nLevel Achieved \n\n2323 Bryan Street (Office)\n\nDallas\n\nLEED (1) \n\nGold\n\n29A International Business Park\n\nSingapore\n\nBCA Green Mark (3) \n\nPlatinum\n\nDigital Seoul No. 1\n\nSeoul\n\nG-SEED (2) \n\nLevel 3\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) LEED TM : Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) G-SEED: Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) BCA Green Mark: Building and Construction Authority Green Mark ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nFor existing buildings, we seek to benchmark 100% of properties in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and pursue EPA ENERGY STAR certification for eligible U.S. properties. In 2022, we achieved ENERGY STAR for Data Centers recognition for 27 data centers, representing 36% of our U.S. managed data center portfolio by square feet. We may also certify certain properties outside the U.S. in accordance with regionally-recognized energy performance rating standards, such as the NABERS rating scheme in Australia. In total, 29% of our total global managed portfolio by square feet had an energy rating as of December 31, 2022.

For our operating portfolio, annual capital expense investment planning identifies and evaluates resource efficiency project opportunities alongside non-resource-impacting capital investments. For acquisitions and new development activity, resiliency risks, resource availability, and renewable energy access are considered. Our design and construction process incorporates sustainable features that support resource efficiency during construction as well as during the operational lifecycle of the sites.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe seek to proactively identify and support opportunities to efficiently utilize resources, such as energy and water, throughout our operating portfolio. We set annual power usage effectiveness (&#8220;PUE&#8221;) targets for assets. Twenty-six of our data centers in EMEA participate in the European Union&#8217;s Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centers, a voluntary initiative which addresses airflow management, cooling system efficiency and capital plant replacement. \n\n&#8203; \n\nGlobally, we conduct external technical building assessments as well as utilize ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager scores to prioritize efficiency opportunities. Energy efficiency measures implemented typically involve HVAC and lighting-related improvements and building commissioning. In 2021, energy efficiency measures implemented totaled over 50,150 MWh in projected energy savings. \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe set a global carbon reduction target that has been validated by the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 68% per square foot and Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and fuel- and energy-related activities 24% per square foot by 2030, from a 2018 baseline. In 2021, we showed a 42% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 11% reduction in Scope 3 emissions against our baseline. Additionally, we are a signatory to the EU Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, a Self-Regulatory Initiative committing to climate neutrality by 2030 and setting additional goals around energy efficiency, carbon-free energy sourcing, water conservation and waste heat recycling. We continue to match the energy consumption of our European portfolio and the U.S. colocation business unit with renewable energy certificates. Our five operational U.S. renewable energy purchase agreements produced 797,000 MWh of renewable energy credits in 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe implement ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and ISO 50001 (Energy Management) to measure, manage and improve the energy and environmental performance of our data centers. In 2021, 40% of our global portfolio had ISO 14001 certifications and 18% of our global portfolio was covered under ISO 50001. Additionally, 100% of our Singapore portfolio was certified under the SS564 Green Data Centres standard for Energy and Environmental Management Systems.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWater Management \n\n&#8203; \n\na) 2021 Water Data (1) \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nWater Withdrawal Data Coverage as % of Floor Area \n\n% of Floor Area with 40% or Greater Baseline Water Stress (2) \n\nTotal Water Withdrawn by Portfolio Area with Data Coverage (cubic meters, in thousands) (3) \n\n% of Water Withdrawn with 40% or Greater Baseline Water Stress (2) \n\nLike-for-Like Change in Water Withdrawals &#160;(4) \n\n86%\n\n39%\n\n5,718 \n\n48%\n\n5%\n\n##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The most recent full year for which water data is available is 2021. The scope of data coverage includes managed and non-managed assets. The scope of water withdrawals is aligned with the 2021 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide. In 2021, 99% of the Company&#8217;s portfolio consisted of data center space along with limited accessory uses, predominantly office. These secondary space types are not broken out by subsector. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Based on properties classified as High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress determined by the World Resources Institute&#8217;s (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool, Aqueduct.

We consider water availability, cost, and alternate supply solutions to potable water such as municipally supplied non-potable water, which accounted for 36% of our total water usage in 2021. We also consider cooling system designs to maximize &#8216;free cooling&#8217; and reduce or eliminate reliance on access to water for cooling. Our Global Water Strategy addresses the strategic role that water plays in our operations, identifies regions where water quality and scarcity pose the greatest interruption risk to our business, and creates a pipeline of projects and opportunities to advance our position with respect to water conservation, resiliency, and redundancy in our operations. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nManagement of Tenant Sustainability Impacts \n\n&#8203; \n\na) 2021 Tenant Sustainability (1) \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n% of New Leases with Cost Recovery Clause for Efficiency Improvements (2) \n\nLeased Floor Area of New Leases with Cost Recovery Clause (Square Feet) \n\n% of Total Leased Floor Area with Cost Recovery Clauses (3) \n\n% of Leased Floor Area that is Separately Metered for Electricity Consumption (4) \n\n23%\n\n327,536\n\n46%\n\n78%\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) The most recent full year for which tenant sustainability data is available is 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Data provided for new data center scale leases signed and excludes colocation and Powered Base Building agreements. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Total leased floor area excludes non-managed unconsolidated entities, vacant space, space held for development, space under active development, Powered Base Building, colocation, and non-technical space. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Excludes unconsolidated entities, vacant space, space held for development, space under active development, and non-technical space. Water use is predominantly driven by shared cooling infrastructure, common areas, and exterior landscape irrigation and is not separately metered. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nb) Approach to measuring, incentivizing and improving sustainability impacts of tenants \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe seek to incorporate &#8220;green lease&#8221; language into agreements with new customers where energy is separately metered, and we endeavor to incorporate green lease language into renewals. We launched our green lease program for applicable contract types to better align interests between landlord and tenants to incentivize energy and resource efficiency investments, share energy and water usage data, streamline renewable energy procurement and support sustainable building certifications. \n\n&#8203; \n\nClimate Change Adaptation \n\n&#8203; \n\na) Properties located in 100-Year Flood Zones \n\n&#8203; \n\nSeven U.S. data centers totaling about 1.95 million square feet are exposed to 100-year flood zones designated by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;) as special flood hazard areas (&#8220;SFHA&#8221;). An additional 26 data centers in Europe totaling about 2.59 million square feet are exposed to 100-year flood zones. \n\n&#8203; \n\nb) Climate Change Risks and Mitigation Strategies \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe evaluate potential risks and opportunities as a result of climate change and have implemented strategies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities. Climate change risks that we have identified include acute and chronic physical risks, as well as transition risks such as market, policy, reputational, and technology risks. Management of climate-related risks and opportunities is a company-wide effort, delivered through an interdisciplinary effort with contributions from our global operations team, risk management, environmental occupational health and safety, compliance, information security, physical security and other functions, with oversight by our Executive Leadership Team and governed by our Board of Directors. We manage potential risks first via our siting and design standards, then by implementing recommendations to proactively mitigate losses related to short-term acute weather events as well as long-term climate-related changes. Climate resilience measures include maintaining appropriate levels of insurance for each asset, performing climate risk scenario analyses for a selection of our global portfolio, and implementing operational risk reduction measures at the site level. We continue to align our ESG Report with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board&#8217;s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (&#8220;TCFD&#8221;) to disclose specific climate-related financial risks and opportunities, mitigation strategies, and associated metrics and targets.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nCompetition\n\nWe compete with numerous data center providers globally, many of whom own or operate properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our data centers are located, including Equinix, Inc. and NTT; various private operators in the U.S.; as well as Global Switch Holdings Limited and various regional operators in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and Australia. See \"We face significant competition, which may adversely affect the occupancy and rental rates of our data centers.\" in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nRegulation\n\nGeneral\n\nOur properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe each of our properties as of December 31, 2022 has the necessary permits and approvals to operate. \n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act \n\nOur properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined by the ADA. We believe our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make accommodations in accordance with the ADA, as well as other applicable laws and regulations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect. See &#8220;We may incur significant costs complying with applicable laws and governmental regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\nWe are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and could affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"We could incur significant costs related to environmental matters, including from government regulation, private litigation, and existing conditions at some of our properties.\" in Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.\n\nClimate change legislation. In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, via a cap-and-trade program. The U.S. Senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation. \n\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal climate change legislation (apart from the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, which commits funding to climate and energy programs but does not impose mandatory emissions reductions), regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and states have taken the lead in regulating GHG emissions in the U.S. Under the Obama administration, from 2009 through 2016, the EPA moved aggressively to regulate GHG emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources, including electricity producers, using its authority under the Clean Air Act. From 2017 through 2020, the Trump administration moved to eliminate or modify certain of the EPA&#8217;s GHG emissions regulations and refocus the EPA&#8217;s mission away from such regulation. However, the Biden administration has described climate change regulation as a top priority, announcing in April 2021 a target of reducing net U.S. GHG emissions by 50-52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe EPA made an endangerment finding in 2009 that allows it to create regulations imposing emissions reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of GHGs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be fully known until all regulations are finalized and legal challenges are resolved. Under the Obama administration, the EPA finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit GHGs under the Clean Air Act New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or NSR PSD, and Title V permitting programs. As a result, newly-issued NSR PSD and Title V permits for new or modified electricity generating units (EGUs) and other facilities may need to address GHG emissions, including by requiring the installation of &#8220;Best Available Control Technology.&#8221; The EPA also implemented in December 2015 the &#8220;Clean Power Plan&#8221; regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal-fired and natural gas EGUs. However, in 2019 the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the &#8220;Affordable Clean Energy Rule&#8221; to replace the Clean Power Plan. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule requires heat rate efficiency improvements at certain EGUs, but does not place numeric limits on EGU emissions. In 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated both the Affordable Clean Energy Rule and the Clean Power Plan repeal rule, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the ruling in 2022. The EPA announced in January 2023 that it expects to propose carbon standards for new and existing power plants in April 2023 and finalize them by June 2024. Separately, the EPA&#8217;s GHG &#8220;reporting rule&#8221; requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report GHG emissions.\n\nStates have been driving regulation to reduce GHG emissions in the United States. At the state level, California implemented a GHG cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in January 2013. In September 2016, California adopted legislation calling for a further reduction in GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and in July 2017, California extended its cap-and-trade program through 2030. In September 2018, California adopted legislation that will require all of the state&#8217;s electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045. California also in December 2022 passed a regulation to achieve a zero-carbon economy by 2045. The plan sets out various goals, including cutting GHG emissions by 48 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, exceeding the state&#8217;s mandate of a 40 percent reduction. As other examples of state action, in May 2021, Washington passed a law capping GHG emissions from electricity generators and other entities, and in December 2021 Oregon adopted a GHG cap-and-trade program. In addition, in January 2023, New York implemented a &#8220;cap-and-invest&#8221; program which sets an annual cap on the amount of GHG emissions permitted statewide to meet the New York Climate Act requirement of a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 and at least an 85 percent reduction by 2050, in each case using 1990 as a baseline. Additionally, a number of states have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards to increase the use of renewable energy, and a number of eastern states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a market-based program aimed at reducing GHG emissions from power plants.\n\nOutside the United States, the European Union, or EU (as well as the United Kingdom), have been operating since 2005 under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of GHGs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power, and the EU has taken a number of other climate change-related initiatives, including a directive targeted at improving energy efficiency (which introduces energy efficiency auditing requirements). In December 2019, EU leaders endorsed the objective of achieving by 2050 a climate-neutral EU, with net-zero GHG emissions, and in July 2021 the European Commission adopted the European Climate Law to write this goal into the law. The European Climate Law includes a 2030 GHG reduction target of at least 55% below 1990 levels. In July 2021 the European Commission also adopted a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to institute a carbon import tax, which covers electricity imports. In November 2022, the European Commission reached a provisional agreement with the European Parliament to establish binding GHG emission targets for the transport, buildings, waste, and agriculture sectors. National legislation may also be implemented independently by members of the EU. The United Kingdom, after Brexit, independently adopted a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and implemented an emissions trading scheme.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the United States and 194 other countries and looks to prevent global average temperatures from increasing by more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, went into force in November 2016. President Trump announced in June 2017 that he would initiate the process to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement; however, upon his inauguration in January 2021, President Biden signed an order rejoining the Paris Agreement.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Canadian Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act established a carbon-pricing regime that went into effect in January 2019 for provinces and territories in Canada where there is no provincial system in place already, or where the provincial system does not meet the federal benchmark. The act was challenged in court and upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in March 2021. Climate change regulations are also in various stages of implementation in other nations as well, including nations where we operate, such as Japan, Singapore, and Australia.\n\nInsurance\n\nWe carry commercial general liability, property, business interruption insurance, and other insurance coverage on all of the properties in our portfolio. We select coverages, policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of coverage, and industry practice. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and wholly-owned captive insurance entity. We believe the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured exposures such as loss from war or nuclear reaction. In addition, we carry earthquake insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. See &#8220;Potential losses may not be covered by insurance.&#8221; in Item 1A. Risk Factors. \n\nHuman Capital Resource Management \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 3,412 full-time employees. The geographic distribution of our global employee base as of December 31, 2022 is summarized in the following table.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nRegion \n\n&#160; \n\nNumber of Employees \n\nNorth America\n\n&#160;\n\n1,492 \n\nEurope\n\n&#160;\n\n1,728 \n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#160;\n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n3,412\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nCompensation, Benefits and Employee Wellbeing \n\n&#8203; \n\nTo attract and retain the best-qualified talent and to help our employees maintain healthy and balanced lives, and meet their financial and retirement goals, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, flexible vacation, parental leave, 401(k) company match, an employee stock purchase plan, fitness reimbursement program, commuter benefits, tuition reimbursement, employee skills development and leadership development. Employee surveys are conducted regularly to solicit feedback and to help prioritize and improve employee engagement.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe also encourage our employees to give back to the community by matching their contributions to eligible charitable organizations through our Matching Gifts Program. Additionally, our Donate 8 Program grants paid time off each year to employees for the purpose of volunteering for eligible organizations. We also sponsor and support the Women&#8217;s Leadership Forum, the Black Employee Resource Group, Digital Pride, the Hispanic Employee Resource Group, and the Veterans Employee Group, which promote a diverse and inclusive network to grow and deliver the next wave of digital innovation.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe prioritize providing programs and benefits that promote healthy and productive lifestyles. We offer a company-wide wellness program, Wellness@Digital, that serves to invest in the health, fitness, financial wellness and overall quality of life for our employees. We implement wellness challenges that promote physical activity and an active lifestyle, with additional price incentivizes for winners of the challenges. \n\n&#8203; \n\nDuring 2022, we sought to play an active role in supporting the communities we operate in across North America, EMEA and APAC. This included companywide giving focused on our four areas of philanthropic focus (disaster relief, STEM, sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion).\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \n\n&#8203; \n\nIt is our Company&#8217;s policy to recruit talent based on skill, knowledge, attitude and experience, without discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, age, family status, ethnic origin, nationality, disability or religious belief. In 2020, we formally launched our DEI Employee Leadership Council to assess the current state of our diversity, equity and inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) initiatives beyond the Women&#8217;s Leadership Forum and Veteran&#8217;s employee resource groups. The Council partners with HR to identify opportunities for progress, formulate a cohesive strategy, and ultimately lead our global DEI effort. The DEI Council is led by employees spanning various management levels and global regions with program support from our executive management team. Since 2020, the Company has launched three new employee resource groups (ERGs)&#8212;Digital Pride (LGBTQI+), the Black ERG, and the Hispanic ERG. Today, more than 600 employees globally are members of Digital Realty&#8217;s ERGs. Additionally, the DEI Employee Leadership Council runs a philanthropic program aligning Digital Realty&#8217;s DEI efforts with charitable giving; organizations ranging from the National Museum of African American History &#38; Culture, to InterPride, to DFW Canines for Veterans are included.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDigital Realty&#8217;s DEI focus and work are set with the &#8220;tone from the top&#8221; from President &#38; CEO Andrew P. Power. He has signed the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity &#38; Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Mr. Power and his leadership team help drive our DEI efforts including through ERG sponsorship and employee DEI events. In 2022, we published our EEO-1 report, providing transparency on the racial and gender composition of our U.S. workforce.

Tax liabilities and attributes inherited in connection with acquisitions may adversely impact our business. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations \n\nOur business depends upon the demand for data centers. \n\nWe are in the business of owning, acquiring, developing and operating data centers. A reduction in the demand for data center space, power or connectivity would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a less specialized use. Our substantial development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns as well as adverse developments in the data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology could also reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide. In addition, our customers may choose to develop new data centers or expand their own existing data centers or consolidate into data centers that we do not own or operate, which could reduce demand for our newly developed data centers or result in the loss of one or more key customers. If any of our key customers were to do so, it could result in a loss of business to us or put pressure on our pricing. Mergers or consolidations of technology companies could reduce further the number of our customers and potential customers and make us more dependent on a more limited number of customers. If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our data centers in the future. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any or all of these factors.\n\nWe face significant competition, which may adversely affect the occupancy and rental rates of our data centers. \n\nWe compete with numerous data center providers globally, many of whom own or operate properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our data centers are located, including Equinix, Inc. and NTT; various private operators in the U.S.; as well as Global Switch Holdings Limited and various regional operators in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and Australia. In addition, we may in the future face competition from new entrants into the data center market, including new entrants who may acquire our current competitors. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and more ready access to capital which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities.\n\nIf our competitors offer space that our customers or potential customers perceive to be superior to ours based on factors such as available power, security, location, or connectivity, or if they offer rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we are offering, we may lose customers or potential customers or be required to incur costs to improve our data centers or reduce our rental rates. In addition, many of our competitors have developed and continue to develop additional data center space. If the supply of data center space continues to increase as a result of these activities or otherwise, rental rates may be reduced or we may face delays in leasing or be unable to lease our vacant space, including space that we develop. Further, if customers or potential customers desire services that we do not offer, we may not be able to lease our space to those customers. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any or all of these factors.\n\nAny failure of our physical or information technology or operational technology infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions. \n\nOur business depends on providing customers with highly reliable services, including with respect to power supply, physical security and maintenance of environmental conditions. We may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, including mechanical failure, power outage, human error, physical or electronic security breaches, war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, pandemics, hurricane, flood and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism. Our systems may be susceptible to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nProblems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or equipment damage. Substantially all of our customer agreements include terms requiring us to meet certain service level commitments to our customers. Any failure to meet these or other commitments or any equipment damage in our data centers, including as a result of mechanical failure, power outage, human error or other reasons, could subject us to liability under the terms of our customer agreements, including service level credits against customer rent payments, monetary damages, or, in certain cases of repeated failures, the right by the customer to terminate the agreement. Service interruptions, equipment failures or security breaches may also expose us to additional legal liability and monetary damages and damage our brand and reputation, and could cause our customers to terminate or not renew their agreements. In addition, we may be unable to attract new customers if we have a reputation for service disruptions, equipment failures or physical or electronic security breaches in our data centers. Any such failures could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may be vulnerable to breaches, or unauthorized access to, or disruption of our physical and information technology and operational technology infrastructure and systems. \n\nSecurity breaches, or disruption, of our or our customers&#8217; physical or information technology or operational technology infrastructure, networks and related management systems and controls could result in, among other things, unauthorized access to our facilities, a breach of our and our customers&#8217; networks and information technology infrastructure, the misappropriation of our or our customers&#8217; or their customers&#8217; proprietary or confidential information, interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers&#8217; operations, delays or interruptions to our ability to meet customer needs, breach of our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, inability to access or rely upon critical business records or other disruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches. We may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, material monetary damages, potential violations of applicable privacy and other laws, penalties and fines, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security and insurance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough our customers&#8217; computing equipment resides in our buildings, we generally do not have access to, nor do we have knowledge of, what applications and data are being housed and processed on their equipment. In certain instances, we provide digital infrastructure and platforms as a service to our customers, which increases the risk of loss of data, and have recently expanded these aspects of our business. In the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and any subsequent amended versions of it, and similar regulations that apply to our business globally may have significant impact on our compliance frameworks and operations. If we fail to comply with these various regulations, we may have to pay fines or damages. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.\n\nWe have made, and continue to make, investments to update and modernize our information technology systems and expect such investments to continue in order to meet our business needs, including for ongoing improvements for our customer experience. Additionally, as part of our global platform strategy, we have acquired and invested in, and continue to acquire and invest in, businesses and operations globally, including in new regions with complex and evolving regulatory frameworks and different risk profiles. Transitioning to new or upgraded systems, and integrating acquired networks and data, can create difficulties, including potential disruptions to current processes and cybersecurity complexities. In addition, our information technology systems may require further modification as we grow and as our business needs change, which could prolong difficulties we experience with such transitions and integrations. Such significant investments in our systems may take longer to deploy and cost more than originally planned. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits we hoped to achieve, and we may need to expend significant attention, time and resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing various functions. Difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information or operational technology systems or significant system failures or delays or the failure to successfully modify our systems and respond to changes in our business needs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe depend on significant customers, and many of our data centers are single-tenant properties or are currently occupied by single tenants. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the 20 largest customers in our portfolio represented approximately 50% of the total annualized recurring revenue generated by our properties. Our top three customers represented approximately 17% of the total annualized recurring revenue generated by our properties as of December 31, 2022. In addition, 33 of our 316 data centers are occupied by single customers, including data centers occupied solely by our top three customers. Many factors, including global economic conditions, may cause our customers to experience a downturn in their businesses or otherwise experience a lack of liquidity, which may weaken their financial condition and impact our estimates as to the probability of collectability of payments, and ultimately result in their failure to make timely rental and other payments or their default under their agreements with us. Further, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our customers&#8217; current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. If any customer defaults or fails to make timely rent or other payments, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf any customer becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the customer solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy court might authorize the customer to reject and terminate its contracts with us. Our claim against the customer for unpaid, future rent and other payments would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining amounts actually owed under their agreements with us. In either case, our claim for unpaid rent and other amounts would likely not be paid in full. Our revenue and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected if any of our significant customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent, suffer a downturn in their businesses, fail to renew their contracts or renew on terms less favorable to us than their current terms. As of February 21, 2023, we had no material customers in bankruptcy.\n\nFailure to attract, grow and retain a diverse and balanced customer base, including key magnet customers, could harm our business and operating results. \n\nOur ability to attract, grow and retain a diverse and balanced customer base, consisting of enterprises, cloud service providers, network service providers, and digital economy customers, some of which we consider to be key magnets drawing in other customers, may affect our ability to maximize our revenues. Dense and desirable customer concentrations within a facility enable us to better generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our data centers will depend on a variety of factors, including our product offerings, the presence of carriers, the overall mix of customers, the presence of key customers attracting business through ecosystems, the data center&#8217;s operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our product offerings. Our inability to develop, provide or effectively execute any of these factors may hinder the development, growth and retention of a diverse and balanced customer base and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur contracts with our customers could subject us to significant liability. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with our customers pursuant to which we provide data center space, power, environmental controls, physical security and connectivity products to our customers. These contracts typically contain indemnification and liability provisions, in addition to service level commitments, which could potentially impose a significant cost on us in the event of losses arising out of certain breaches of such agreements, services to be provided by us or our subcontractors or from third-party claims. Customers increasingly are looking to pass through their regulatory obligations and other liabilities to their outsourced data center providers and we may not be able to limit our liability or damages in an event of loss suffered by such customers whether as a result of our breach of an agreement or otherwise. Further, liabilities and standards for damages and enforcement actions, including the regulatory framework applicable to different types of losses, vary by jurisdiction, and we may be subject to greater liability for certain losses in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, in connection with our acquisitions, we have assumed existing agreements with customers that may subject us to greater liability for such an event of loss. If such an event of loss occurred, we could be liable for material monetary damages and could incur significant legal fees in defending against such an action, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nCertain of our customer agreements may include restrictions on the sale of our properties to certain third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\nCertain of our customer agreements may prohibit us from selling certain properties to a third party unless specified conditions are met. The existence of such restrictions could hinder our ability to sell one or more of these properties, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur data centers may not be suitable for re-leasing without significant expenditures or renovations. \n\nBecause many of our data centers contain tenant improvements installed at our customers&#8217; expense, they may be better suited for a specific data center user or technology industry customer and could require significant modification in order for us to re-lease vacant space to another data center user or technology industry customer. The tenant improvements may also become outdated or obsolete as the result of technological change, the passage of time or other factors. In addition, our development space will generally require substantial improvement to be suitable for data center use. For the same reason, our properties also may not be suitable for leasing to traditional office customers without significant expenditures or renovations.\n\nAs a result, we may be required to invest significant amounts or offer significant discounts to customers in order to lease or re-lease that space, either of which could adversely affect our financial and operating results.\n\nWe may be unable to lease vacant or development space, renew leases, or re-lease space as leases expire. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we owned approximately 9.2 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 3.4 million square feet of space held for future development. We intend to continue to add new space to our development inventory and to continue to develop additional space from this inventory. A portion of the space that we develop has been, and may continue to be, developed on a speculative basis, meaning that we do not have a signed customer agreement for the space when we begin the development process. We also develop space specifically for customers pursuant to agreements signed prior to beginning the development process. In those cases, if we fail to meet our development obligations under those agreements, these customers may be able to terminate the agreements and we would be required to find a new customer for this space. In addition, in certain circumstances we lease data center facilities prior to their completion. If we fail to complete the facilities in a timely manner, the customer may be entitled to terminate its agreement, seek damages or penalties against us or pursue other remedies and we may be required to find a new customer for the space. We cannot assure you that once we have developed space or land we will be able to successfully lease it at all, or at rates we consider favorable or expected at the time we commenced development. Further, once development of a data center facility is complete, we incur certain operating expenses even if there are no customers occupying any space. If we are not able to complete development in a timely manner or successfully lease the space that we develop, if development costs are higher than we currently estimate, or if rental rates are lower than expected when we began the project or are otherwise undesirable, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2022, customer agreements representing 23.4% of the square footage of the properties in our portfolio, excluding month-to-month leases and space held for development, were scheduled to expire through 2024, and an additional 16.0% of the net rentable square footage, excluding space held for development, was available to be leased. Some of this space may require substantial capital investment to meet the power and cooling requirements of our customers, or may no longer be suitable for their needs. In addition, we cannot assure you that customer agreements will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at all, or at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing customers do not renew their agreements, we do not lease or re-lease our available space, including newly developed space and space for which customer agreements are scheduled to expire, or it takes longer for us to lease or re-lease this space or for rents to commence on this space, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nAdditionally, a customer&#8217;s decision to lease space and power in one of our data centers and to purchase additional products typically involves a significant commitment of resources and due diligence on the part of our customers regarding the adequacy of our facilities. As a result, the leasing of data center space can have a long sales cycle, and we may expend significant time and resources in pursuing a particular transaction that may not result in revenue. Economic conditions, including market downturns, may further impact this long sales cycle by making it difficult for customers to plan future business activities, which could cause customers to slow spending or delay decision-making. Our inability to adequately manage the risks associated with the sales cycle may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nEven if we have additional space available for lease at any one of our data centers, our ability to lease this space to existing or new customers could be constrained by our ability to provide sufficient electrical power. \n\nAs current and future customers increase their power footprint in our data centers over time, the corresponding reduction in available power could limit our ability to increase occupancy rates or network density within our existing data centers. Furthermore, at certain of our data centers, our aggregate maximum contractual obligation to provide power and cooling to our customers may exceed the physical capacity at such data centers if customers were to quickly increase their demand for power and cooling. If we are not able to increase the available power and/or cooling or move the customer to another location within our data centers with sufficient power and cooling to meet such demand, we could lose the customer as well as be exposed to liability under our customer agreements. In addition, our power and cooling systems are difficult and expensive to upgrade. Accordingly, we may not be able to efficiently upgrade or change these systems to meet new demands without incurring significant costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. Any such material loss of customers, liability or additional costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOur portfolio depends upon local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in certain locations. \n\nOur portfolio is located in 54 metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio, including the 59 data centers held as investments in unconsolidated entities, was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan areas:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\nMetropolitan Area \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal annualized rent &#160;(1) \n\nNorthern Virginia\n\n&#160;\n\n18.3 \n\n%\n\nChicago\n\n&#160;\n\n8.4 \n\n%\n\nLondon\n\n&#160;\n\n5.9 \n\n%\n\nNew York\n\n&#160;\n\n5.8 \n\n%\n\nFrankfurt\n\n&#160;\n\n5.4 \n\n%\n\nDallas\n\n&#160;\n\n5.4 \n\n%\n\nSilicon Valley\n\n&#8203; \n\n5.4 \n\n%\n\nSingapore\n\n&#160;\n\n5.2 \n\n%\n\nSao Paulo\n\n&#160;\n\n4.2 \n\n%\n\nAmsterdam\n\n&#160;\n\n3.8 \n\n%\n\nJohannesburg\n\n&#160;\n\n2.5 \n\n%\n\nParis\n\n&#160;\n\n2.2 \n\n%\n\nPhoenix\n\n&#160;\n\n1.8 \n\n%\n\nSan Francisco\n\n&#160;\n\n1.7 \n\n%\n\nPortland\n\n&#8203; \n\n1.7 \n\n%\n\nOther\n\n&#160;\n\n22.3 \n\n%\n\nTotal \n\n&#160;\n\n100.0 \n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of December 31, 2022 multiplied by 12.

The aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $117.3 million. ##TABLE_END \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nSome of these areas have experienced downturns in recent years. We depend upon the local economic conditions in these areas, including local real estate conditions, and our operations, revenue and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected by a downturn in local economic conditions in these areas. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these areas or supply otherwise increases or exceeds demand. We cannot assure you that these locations will grow or will remain favorable to data center investments or operations. In addition, we are currently developing data centers in certain of these metropolitan areas. Any negative changes in real estate, technology or economic conditions in these metropolitan areas in particular could negatively impact our performance.\n\nOur business and operations, and our customers, suppliers and business partners may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks. \n\nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which we or our customers, suppliers or business partners operate, and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, may have a material and adverse impact on general commercial activity and on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and creditworthiness. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could result in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of such illness, disease or virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, manufacturing restrictions, declarations of states of emergency, business shutdowns, prioritization and allocation of resources, and restrictions on the movement of our employees and those of our customers, suppliers and business partners on which we rely, which could adversely affect our ability and their respective abilities to adequately manage our respective businesses. Risks related to epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our offices or properties or our customers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; or business partners&#8217; businesses, or otherwise result in significant disruptions to our business and operations or theirs. Such events could materially and adversely impact our operations and the rental revenue we generate from our agreements with our customers or could result in defaults by our customers. \n\nIn particular, the global spread of COVID-19 and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, including in construction activity. We have experienced delays in construction activity in our markets due to government restrictions in specific locations and as a result of the availability of labor, and these delays have impacted and are continuing to impact some of our anticipated deliveries to our customers. We may continue to experience delays in construction activity, even after government restrictions are eased and construction labor becomes more readily available, due to increased safety protocols implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nWe cannot predict the full extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our customers, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us, our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals&#8217; actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability of and cost to access the capital markets; the effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our services; the impact on our development projects; and disruptions or restrictions on our employees&#8217; ability to work and travel.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe lease or sublease certain of our data center space from third parties and the ability to retain these leases or subleases could be a significant risk to our ongoing operations. \n\nWe do not own all the buildings in our portfolio. These leased buildings accounted for approximately 16% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we may acquire additional leased data center space or businesses that lease facilities instead of owning them. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, in several of our smaller facilities we sublease our space, and our rights under these subleases are dependent on our sublandlord retaining its rights under the prime lease. When the initial terms of our existing leases expire, we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases for one or more renewal periods, subject to, in the case of several of our subleases, our sublandlord renewing its term under the prime lease. If renewal rates are less favorable than those we currently have, we may be required to increase revenues within existing data centers to offset such increase in lease payments. Failure to increase revenues to sufficiently offset these projected higher costs could adversely impact our operating income. Upon the end of our renewal options, we would have to renegotiate our lease terms with the applicable landlords.\n\nAdditionally, if we are unable to renew the lease at any of our data centers, we could lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by the relocation. We could also lose those customers that choose our data centers based on their locations. The costs of relocating data center infrastructure equipment, such as generators, power distribution units and cooling units, to different data centers could be prohibitive and, as such, we could lose the value of this equipment. For these reasons, any lease that cannot be renewed could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe and our customers may experience supply chain or procurement disruptions, or increased supply chain costs, which may lead to delays. \n\nThe development of our data centers requires the timely delivery of required equipment and materials. We rely on third parties to provide the equipment and materials needed for our construction and development needs. Our global supply chain and development activities could be impacted by disruptions, such as political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents, pandemics and other business interruptions, which could impact our ability to meet delivery timelines, including delivery timelines to our customers, and lead to delays, reputational damage, potential penalties that we may be required to pay and potential terminations of agreements by our customers. If any such delay or disruption were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. Changes in the timing or costs of procuring materials and equipment used in our construction and development programs, including vendor costs, or changes in our relationships with vendors, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Similarly, our customers may experience supply chain or procurement disruptions, constraints and increased costs, which may impact their ability to deploy in our facilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have actively monitored our vendors and suppliers and remain in frequent communication with customers, contractors and suppliers. We have proactively managed our supply chain, and we believe the equipment needed will be delivered to complete our ongoing development activities. Although to date, we have been able to manage through disruptions in our supply chain and procurement process due to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. However, the full extent and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our future supply chain and procurement process cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. In addition, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, an increase in cyber security incidents as well as supply chain disruptions. In particular, disruptions in the oil and gas and electric power markets have caused, and could continue to cause, significant increases in energy prices, which could have a material effect on our business. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Some of our data centers in Europe partially rely on energy produced in-part from fossil fuels originating from Russia, which Russia has reduced. If Russia further reduces or turns off energy supplies to Europe, our European operations could be affected adversely.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe may not be able to adapt to changing technologies and customer requirements, and our data center infrastructure may become obsolete. \n\nThe technology industry generally and specific industries in which certain of our customers operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology, customer requirements and industry standards. New systems to deliver power to or eliminate heat in data centers or the development of new server technology that does not require the levels of critical load and heat removal that our facilities are designed to provide and could be run less expensively on a different platform could make our data center infrastructure obsolete. Our power and cooling systems are difficult and expensive to upgrade, and we may not be able to efficiently upgrade or change these systems to meet new demands without incurring significant costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the infrastructure that connects our data centers to the Internet and other external networks may become insufficient, including with respect to latency, reliability and connectivity. We may not be able to adapt to changing technologies or meet customer demands for new processes or technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all, which would adversely impact our ability to sustain and grow our business.\n\nFurther, our inability to adapt to changing customer requirements may make our data centers obsolete or unmarketable to such customers. Some of our customers operate at significant scale across numerous data center facilities and have designed cloud and computing networks with redundancies and fail-over capabilities across these facilities, which enhances the resiliency of their networks and applications. As a result, these customers may realize cost benefits by locating their data center operations in facilities with less electrical or mechanical infrastructure redundancy than is found in our existing data center facilities. Additionally, some of our customers have begun to operate their data centers using a wider range of humidity levels and at temperatures that are higher than servers customarily have operated at in the past, all of which may result in energy cost savings for these customers. We may not be able to operate our existing data centers under these environmental conditions, particularly in multi-tenant facilities with other customers who are not willing to operate under these conditions, and our data centers could be at a competitive disadvantage to facilities that satisfy such requirements. Because we may not be able to modify the redundancy levels or environmental systems of our existing data centers cost effectively, these or other changes in customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, due to regulations that apply to our customers as well as industry standards, such as ISO and SOC certifications which customers may deem desirable, they may seek specific requirements from their data centers that we are unable to provide. If new or different regulations or standards are adopted or such extra requirements are demanded by our customers, we could lose some customers or be unable to attract new customers in certain industries, which could materially and adversely affect our operations.\n\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers for power, and we are vulnerable to service failures and price increases by such suppliers and to volatility in the supply and price of power in the open market. \n\nWe rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers, and we cannot ensure that these third parties will deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. If the amount of power available to us is inadequate to support our customer requirements, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to our customers or grow our business. In addition, our data centers may be susceptible to power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages. Power outages may last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, which would harm our customers and our business. Any loss of services or equipment damage could adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results, harm our reputation and potentially lead to customer disputes or litigation.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, we may be subject to risks and unanticipated costs associated with obtaining power from various utility companies. Utilities that serve our data centers may be dependent on, and sensitive to price increases for, a particular type of fuel, such as coal, oil or natural gas. In addition, the price of these fuels and the electricity generated from them could increase as a result of: regulations intended to regulate carbon emissions and other pollutants, ratepayer surcharges related to recovering the cost of natural disasters, grid modernization charges, as well as other charges borne by ratepayers. Increases in the cost of power at any of our data centers could put those locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to data centers that are supplied power at a lower price.\n\nWe have also entered into power purchase agreements with contract terms ranging from 5-15 years. These agreements require us to purchase renewable energy and/or renewable energy credits from producers at fixed prices over the terms of the contracts, subject to certain adjustments. In the event that the market price for energy decreases, we may be required to pay more under the power purchase agreements than we would otherwise if we were to purchase renewable energy credits on the open market, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, interruptions in the operations of one or more of the suppliers under these agreements, as a result of unpredictable weather, natural phenomena or otherwise, could negatively impact the quantity of renewable energy credits delivered to us.\n\nWe depend on third parties to provide network connectivity to the customers in our data centers and any delays or disruptions in connectivity may materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. \n\nWe are not a telecommunications carrier. Although our customers generally are responsible for providing their own network connectivity, we still depend upon the presence of telecommunications carriers&#8217; fiber networks serving our data centers in order to attract and retain customers. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results. Any carrier may elect not to offer its services within our data centers. Any carrier that has decided to provide network connectivity to our data centers may not continue to do so for any period of time. Further, some carriers are experiencing business difficulties or have announced consolidations. As a result, some carriers may be forced to downsize or terminate connectivity within our data centers, which could have an adverse effect on the business of our customers and, in turn, our own operating results.\n\nOur data centers may require construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our data centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including regulatory requirements and the availability of construction resources. We have obtained the right to use network resources owned by other companies, including rights to use dark fiber, in order to attract telecommunications carriers and customers to our portfolio. If the establishment of highly diverse network connectivity to our data centers does not occur, is materially delayed or is discontinued, or is subject to failure, our operating results and cash flow may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, any hardware or fiber failures on this network may result in significant loss of connectivity to our data centers. This could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur international activities, including acquisition, ownership and operation of data centers located outside of the United States, subject us to risks different than those we face in the United States and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business. \n\nOur portfolio included 184 data centers, including 44 held in unconsolidated entities, located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2022. We have acquired and developed, and may continue to acquire and develop, and operate data centers outside the United States.\n\nThe ownership and operation of data centers located outside of the United States subject us to risks from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. Changes in the relation of these currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect our revenues and operating margins, may materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt obligations. We may attempt to mitigate some or all of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our properties in the local currency denominations, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that this will be effective. We may also engage in direct hedging activities to mitigate the risks of exchange rate fluctuations in a manner consistent with our qualifications as a REIT, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that this will be effective.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur foreign operations involve additional risks not generally associated with or different from operations in the United States, including:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; our limited knowledge of and relationships with sellers, customers, contractors, suppliers or other parties in these metropolitan areas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; complexity and costs associated with managing international development and operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; difficulty in hiring qualified management, sales and construction personnel and service providers in a timely fashion; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or the occurrence of trade wars; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; differing employment practices and labor issues, including related to works councils, employee committees, labor unions and collective rights of action; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; multiple, conflicting and changing legal, regulatory, entitlement and permitting, and tax and treaty environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; unexpected changes in political environments, such as the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; exposure to increased taxation, confiscation or expropriation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; currency transfer restrictions and limitations on our ability to distribute cash earned in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; difficulty in enforcing agreements in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including those entered into in connection with our acquisitions or in the event of a default by one or more of our customers, suppliers or contractors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; local business and cultural factors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; geographic, political and economic instability, including sovereign credit risk and rapid and unpredictable changes in economic policy and regulatory environments, in certain geographic regions and emerging markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; risks related to bribery and corruption. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, have in the past and may continue to be more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, operations in these regions could be subject to heightened risk of disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. \n\nWith respect to the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal from the European Union, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, tax and customs laws, intellectual property rights, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, employment laws and transport laws could increase costs, disrupt supply chains, and depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our securities.\n\nWe also face risks with investing in unfamiliar metropolitan areas. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international metropolitan areas that are new to us. When we acquire properties located in these metropolitan areas, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy and culture, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. In addition, due diligence, transaction and structuring costs may be higher than those we may face in the United States. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced local partners; however, we cannot assure you that all such risks will be eliminated.\n\nOur inability to overcome these risks could adversely affect our international activities, including our foreign operations and could harm our business and results of operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur recent acquisitions may not achieve the intended benefits or may disrupt our plans and operations. \n\nAcquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial or strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the transaction. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our combination with Interxion in March 2020 and other acquisitions depends, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate each of them with our business. The combination of two independent businesses can be a complex, costly and time-consuming process, which requires significant time and focus from our management team and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and businesses with our business or otherwise realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions. In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully with the operations of our acquisitions, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisitions, including the synergies, operating efficiencies, or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay any potential accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\n\nIn addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customer relationships, among other potential adverse consequences. Actual integration costs may exceed those estimated and there may be further unanticipated costs and the assumption of known and unknown liabilities. While we have assumed that we will incur certain integration expenses, there are factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of such expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. If we cannot integrate and operate acquired properties or businesses to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe risks of combining businesses include, among others:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; we may have underestimated the costs to make any necessary improvements to the acquired properties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the acquired properties may be subject to reassessment, which may result in higher than expected property tax payments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may be unable to integrate new acquisitions quickly and efficiently, particularly acquisitions of operating businesses or portfolios of properties, into our existing operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may face difficulties in integrating employees and in retaining key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may face challenges in keeping existing customers, including key customers, which could adversely impact our revenue; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may be unable to effectively manage our expanded operations; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates on acquired properties. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nAny one of these risks could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of our management&#8217;s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nSeveral of our data centers, including the data centers which we have acquired in the past five years, have been under our management for a limited time. The data centers may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could affect their valuation or revenue potential. We cannot assure you that the operating performance of these data centers will not decline under our management.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to our recent acquisitions, for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers. \n\nOur recent and future acquisitions may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no or limited recourse against the sellers. Unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions, claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities or the former owners of acquired properties or businesses, tax liabilities, claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of acquired properties or businesses, and other liabilities whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. In addition, the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with our acquisitions may exceed our expectations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFurther, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into transactions with limited representations and warranties or with representations and warranties that do not survive the closing of such transactions, in which event we would have no or limited recourse against the sellers of such properties or businesses. While we usually require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification is often limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. We may obtain insurance policies providing for coverage for breaches of certain representations and warranties in certain transactions, subject to certain exclusions and a deductible, however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches of any such representations and warranties. &#160; As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. Finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the properties or businesses acquired by us. While the sellers are generally contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities, there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses as well.\n\nWe may be unable to identify, including sourcing off-market deal flow, and complete acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. \n\nA component of our growth strategy is to continue to acquire additional data centers, and we continually evaluate the market of available properties and businesses and may acquire additional properties or businesses when opportunities exist. To date, a substantial portion of our acquisitions were completed before they were widely marketed by real estate brokers, or &#8220;off-market.&#8221; Properties that are acquired off-market are typically more attractive to us as a purchaser because of the absence of competitive bidding, which could potentially lead to higher prices. We obtain access to off-market deal flow from numerous sources. If we cannot obtain off-market deal flow in the future, our ability to identify and acquire additional properties at attractive prices could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to acquire properties or businesses on favorable terms may be subject to the following significant risks:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; we may be unable to acquire a desired property or business because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including both publicly traded REITs and institutional investment funds; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; even if we are able to acquire a desired property or business, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price or result in other less favorable terms; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of real estate or businesses, these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIf we cannot complete property or business acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nJoint venture (JV) investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our JV partners&#8217; financial condition and disputes between us and our JV partners. \n\nWe currently, and may in the future, co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property or portfolio of properties, partnership, joint venture or other entity. In these events, we are not in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners may have economic, tax or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Our joint venture partners may take actions that are not within our control, which would require us to dispose of the joint venture asset or transfer it to a taxable REIT subsidiary in order for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Such investments may also lead to impasses, for example, as to whether to sell a property, because neither we nor our partner would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with our partners may subject properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners. Each of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses and our financial and operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to close joint ventures, on the anticipated schedule or at all. Failure to complete any such joint venture could have a negative impact on our business and the trading price of our common stock.\n\nAny delays or unexpected costs in the development of our existing space and developable land and new properties acquired for development may delay and harm our growth prospects, future operating results and financial condition. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had approximately 9.2 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 3.4 million square feet of space held for future development. We have built and may continue to build out a large portion of this space on a speculative basis at significant cost. Our successful development of these projects is subject to many risks, including those associated with:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; delays in construction, or changes to the plans or specifications; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; budget overruns, increased prices for raw materials or building supplies, or lack of availability and/or increased costs for specialized data center components, including long lead time items such as generators; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; construction site accidents and other casualties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; financing availability, including our ability to obtain construction financing and permanent financing, or increases in interest rates or credit spreads; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; labor availability, costs, disputes and work stoppages with contractors, subcontractors or others that are constructing the project; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; failure of contractors to perform on a timely basis or at all, or other misconduct on the part of contractors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; access to sufficient power and related costs of providing such power to our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; environmental issues; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; supply chain constraints; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; fire, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; pandemics; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; geological, construction, excavation and equipment problems; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; delays or denials of entitlements or permits, including zoning and related permits, or other delays resulting from requirements of public agencies and utility companies. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, while we intend to develop data centers primarily in metropolitan areas we are familiar with, we may in the future develop data centers in new geographic regions where we expect the development to result in favorable risk-adjusted returns on our investment. We may not possess the same level of familiarity with the development of data centers in other metropolitan areas, which could adversely affect our ability to develop such data centers successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDevelopment activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, also typically require a substantial portion of our management&#8217;s time and attention. This may distract our management from focusing on other operational activities of our business. If we are unable to complete development projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nMany of our costs, such as operating and general and administrative expenses, interest expense and real estate acquisition and construction costs, could be adversely impacted by periods of heightened inflation. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOver the past year, the consumer price index has increased substantially year over year. Federal policies to stimulate the economy during the pandemic and more recent global events, such as the rising price of oil and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may have exacerbated, and may continue to exacerbate, inflation and increases in the consumer price index.\n\nA sustained or further increase in inflation could have an adverse impact on our operating expenses incurred in connection with, among others, the property-related contracted services such as repairs and maintenance, utilities, security and insurance. With regard to utilities expense, which is our largest expense category, the vast majority of the expense is passed directly through to our customers which significantly mitigates our exposure to increases in power costs. For our other operating expenses, we expect to recover some increases from our customers through our existing lease structures, annual rent escalations or from the resetting of rents from our renewal and re-leasing activities. As a result, we do not believe that inflation would result in a significant adverse effect on our net operating income and operating cash flows at the property level. However, there can be no assurance that the impact of inflation will be adequately offset by some of our annual rent escalations contained in our leases, and it is possible that the resetting of rents from our renewal and re-leasing activities would not fully offset the impact of higher operating expenses resulting from inflationary pressure. As a result, during inflationary periods in which the inflation rate exceeds the annual rent escalation percentages within our customer contracts, we may not adequately mitigate the impact of inflation, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs and professional service fees. Rising inflation rates may require us to provide compensation increases beyond historical annual increases, which may unexpectedly or significantly increase our compensation costs. Similarly, professional service fees are also subject to the impact of inflation and expected to increase proportionately with increasing market prices for such services. Consequently, inflation may increase our general and administrative expenses over time and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAdditionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the construction costs necessary to complete our development projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction equipment and materials, labor and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. We rely on a number of third-party suppliers and contractors to supply raw materials, skilled labor and services for our construction projects. Certain increases in the costs of construction equipment and materials can often be managed in our development projects through either general budget contingencies built into our overall construction cost estimates for each of our projects or guaranteed maximum price construction contracts, which stipulate a maximum price for certain construction costs and shift inflation risk to our construction general contractors. However, no assurance can be given that our budget contingencies would accurately account for potential construction cost increases given the current severity of inflation and variety of contributing factors or that our general contractors would be able to absorb such increases in costs and complete our construction projects timely, within budget, or at all. Higher construction costs could adversely impact our investments in real estate assets and expected yields on our development projects, which may adversely impact our returns on our investments. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders could be adversely affected over time.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have substantial debt and face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities, including refinancing and interest rate risks. \n\nOur total consolidated indebtedness at December 31, 2022 was approximately $16.7 billion, and we may incur significant additional debt to finance future acquisition, investment and development activities. As of December 31, 2022, we have a $3.75 billion global revolving credit facility. We have the ability from time to time to increase the size of the global revolving credit facility by up to $750 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. At December 31, 2022, approximately $1.7 billion was available under this facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately $1.7 billion available under the global revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit.\n\nOur substantial indebtedness currently requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, distributions and other general corporate purposes. Additionally, it could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancing of our debt or obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.\n\nIn addition, we may violate restrictive covenants or fail to maintain financial ratios specified in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations, and our secured lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties or our interests in the entities that own the properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases. Our default under any one of our loans could result in a cross-default on other indebtedness. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our access to capital, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and cash available for distribution. Further, foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, a circumstance which could hinder Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.\n\nAdditional risks related to our indebtedness include the following:\n\nWe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness. It is likely that we will need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then our cash flow may not be sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to pay distributions. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing, such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans, result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could materially affect our financial results and may increase the risk our counterparty defaults on our interest rate hedges . Because a significant portion of our debt, including debt incurred under our global revolving credit facilities, bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. If the United States Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to increase short-term interest rates, this could have a significant upward impact on the interest rates that apply to our variable rate debt. Potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, and reduce our access to capital markets. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our floating rate debt. Increased interest rates may increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Conversely, if interest rates are lower than our swapped fixed rates, we will be required to pay more for our debt than we would have had we not entered into the swap agreements.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nAdverse changes in our Company&#8217;s credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity. The credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt and Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s preferred stock are based on our Company&#8217;s operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of our Company. Our Company&#8217;s credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. For example, if the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt are downgraded to below investment grade levels, we may not be able to obtain or maintain extensions on certain of our existing debt. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage our debt maturities, our future growth, our financial condition, the market price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stock, and our development and acquisition activity.\n\nOur global revolving credit facilities and senior notes restrict our ability to engage in some business activities. Our global revolving credit facilities contain negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; make certain investments; merge with another company; and create, incur or assume liens; and require us to maintain financial coverage ratios, including with respect to unencumbered assets.\n\nIn addition, the global revolving credit facilities restrict Digital Realty Trust, Inc. from making distributions to its stockholders, or redeeming or otherwise repurchasing shares of its capital stock, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, except in limited circumstances including as necessary to enable Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to maintain its qualification as a REIT and to avoid the payment of income or excise tax.\n\nIn addition, our unsecured senior notes are governed by indentures, which contain various restrictive covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness and requirements to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets. These restrictions, and the restrictions in our global revolving credit facilities, could cause us to default on our senior notes or global revolving credit facilities, as applicable, or negatively affect our operations or our ability to pay dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders or distributions to Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders, which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock and preferred stock.\n\nFailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by issuing fixed rate debt instruments and by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap, forward or swap lock agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. Our policy is to use these derivatives only to hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings, not for speculative or trading purposes, and to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors. However, we may choose to change this policy in the future. Approximately 80% of our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2022 was subject to fixed interest rates or variable rates subject to interest rate swaps. We do not currently hedge our global revolving credit facilities and as our borrowings under our global revolving credit facilities increase, our percentage of indebtedness not subject to fixed rates and our exposure to interest rates may increase. Hedging may reduce the overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur growth depends on external sources of capital which are outside of our control. \n\nIn order for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it is required under the Code to annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes to the extent that it distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. Digital Realty Trust, L.P. is required to make distributions to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. that will enable the latter to satisfy this distribution requirement and avoid income and excise tax liability. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition or development financing, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs.\n\nOur access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market&#8217;s perception of our business prospects and growth potential, our current and expected future earnings, funds from operations, our cash flow and cash distributions, and the market price per share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at all or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage. Further, equity markets have experienced high volatility recently and we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise capital through the sale of equity securities at all or on favorable terms. Sales of equity on unfavorable terms could result in substantial dilution to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders. In addition, we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms.\n\nIf we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop data centers when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations, pay cash dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders or make distributions to Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders.\n\nDeclining real estate valuations, impairment charges and illiquidity of real estate investments could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. \n\nWe review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price, a significant adverse change in how the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development, a change in our intended holding period due to our intention to sell an asset, or a history of operating or cash flow losses. When such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment&#8217;s or group of properties that operate together as a group use and eventual disposition and compare it to the carrying value of the property or asset group. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property or asset group. These losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. A worsening real estate market may cause us to reevaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis. These impairment charges could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\n\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid and because there may be even fewer buyers for our specialized real estate, our ability to promptly sell properties in our portfolio in response to adverse changes in their performance may be limited, which may harm our financial condition. Further, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. is subject to provisions in the Code that limit a REIT&#8217;s ability to dispose of properties, which limitations are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. See &#8220;Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure&#8212;Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s duty to its stockholders may conflict with the interests of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders&#8212;Tax consequences upon sale or refinancing.&#8221; While Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has exclusive authority under Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s limited partnership agreement to determine whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, such decisions may require the approval of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors. These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nThis lack of liquidity and the Code restrictions may limit our ability to adjust our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to access capital necessary to meet our debt payments and other obligations.\n\nOur success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. \n\nWe depend on the efforts of key personnel of our Company, particularly Andrew P. Power, our President &#38; Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Mercier, our Chief Financial Officer. They are important to our success for many reasons, including that each has a national or regional reputation in our industry and the investment community that attracts investors and business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with investors, lenders, existing and potential customers and industry personnel. If we lost their services, our business and investment opportunities and our relationships with lenders and other capital markets participants, existing and prospective customers and industry personnel could suffer. Many of our Company&#8217;s other senior employees also have strong technology, finance and real estate industry reputations. As a result, we have greater access to potential acquisitions, financing, leasing and other opportunities, and are better able to negotiate with customers. As the number of our competitors increases, it becomes more likely that a competitor would attempt to hire certain of these individuals away from our Company. The loss of any of these key personnel would result in the loss of these and other benefits and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe also depend on the talents and efforts of highly skilled technical individuals. Our success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled technical personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified technical employees is intense, and the availability of qualified technical personnel is not guaranteed.\n\nWe may have difficulty managing our growth. \n\nWe have significantly and rapidly expanded the size of our Company. Our growth may significantly strain our management, operational and financial resources and systems. In addition, as a reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations subject us to certain accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and may strain our management and financial, legal and operational resources and systems. An inability to manage our growth effectively or the increased strain on our management of our resources and systems could result in deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting and could negatively impact financial condition, results of operations and our cash available for distribution.\n\nPotential losses may not be covered by insurance. \n\nWe currently carry commercial general liability, property, business interruption, including loss of rental income, and other insurance policies to cover insurable risks to our Company. We select policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles which we believe to be appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and standard industry practices. Our insurance policies contain industry standard exclusions and we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable perils, such as loss from war or nuclear reaction. A significant portion of our properties are located in seismically active zones such as California, which represents approximately 8% of our portfolio&#8217;s annualized rent as of December 31, 2022. One catastrophic event, for example, in California, could significantly impact multiple properties, the aggregate deductible amounts could be significant and the limits we purchase could prove to be insufficient, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a catastrophic regional event could also severely impact some of our insurers rendering them insolvent or unable to fully pay on claims despite their current financial strength. We may discontinue purchasing insurance against earthquake, flood or windstorm or other perils on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, many of our buildings contain extensive and highly valuable technology-related improvements. Under the terms of our agreements with customers, customers are obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage applicable to such improvements and under most circumstances use their insurance proceeds to restore such improvements after a casualty event. In the event of a casualty or other loss involving one of our buildings with extensive installed tenant improvements, our customers may have the right to terminate their leases if we do not rebuild the base building within prescribed times. In such cases, the proceeds from customers&#8217; insurance will not be available to us to restore the improvements, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to replicate the technology-related improvements made by such customers. Furthermore, the terms of our mortgage indebtedness at certain of our properties may require us to pay insurance proceeds over to our lenders under certain circumstances, rather than use the proceeds to repair the property. If we or one or more of our customers experience a loss which is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.\n\nWe could incur significant costs related to environmental matters, including from government regulation, private litigation, and existing conditions at some of our properties. \n\nUnder various laws relating to the protection of the environment in the United States, as well as in many jurisdictions in Europe, Asia and South America, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at a property, and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at or emanating from a property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. In the United States, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and clean-up of facilities where, or from which, a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened. CERCLA&#8217;s primary mechanism for remedying such problems is to impose strict joint and several liability for clean-up of facilities on current owners and operators of the site, former owners and operators of the site at the time of the disposal of the hazardous substances, any person who arranges for the transportation, disposal or treatment of the hazardous substances, and the transporters who select the disposal and treatment facilities, regardless of the care exercised by such persons. CERCLA also imposes liability for the cost of evaluating and remedying any damage to natural resources. The costs of CERCLA investigation and clean-up can be very substantial. CERCLA also authorizes the imposition of a lien in favor of the United States on all real property subject to, or affected by, a remedial action for all costs for which a party is liable. Subject to certain procedural restrictions, CERCLA gives a responsible party the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable shares of investigative and remedial costs. Our ability to obtain reimbursement from others for their allocable shares of such costs would be limited by our ability to find other responsible parties and prove the extent of their responsibility, their financial resources, and other procedural requirements. Various state laws, as well as laws in Europe, Asia and South America, also impose in certain cases strict joint and several liability for investigation, clean-up and other damages associated with hazardous substance releases.\n\nPrevious owners used some of our properties for industrial and manufacturing purposes, and those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on a majority of the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey and the assessments may fail to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns. In addition, material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after these reviews were completed or may arise in the future. We could be held jointly and severally liable under CERCLA and various state, local and national laws for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination on our properties caused by previous owners or operators. Further, fuel storage tanks are present at most of our properties, and if releases were to occur, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning any resulting contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, some of our customers, particularly those in the biotechnology and life sciences industry and those in the technology manufacturing industry, routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our customers, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or retail uses of those properties. We could be held jointly and severally liable under CERCLA and various state, local and national laws for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released by our customers on our properties. Environmental liabilities could also affect a customer&#8217;s ability to make rental payments to us. We cannot assure you that costs of investigation and remediation of environmental matters will not affect our ability to pay dividends to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and distributions to Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.\n\nSome of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials and lead-based paint. Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials and lead-based paint be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials and lead-based paint. \n\nOur properties and their uses often require permits and entitlements from various government agencies, including permits and entitlements related to zoning and land use. Certain permits from state or local environmental regulatory agencies, including regulators of air quality, are usually required to install and operate diesel-powered generators, which provide emergency back-up power at most of our facilities. These permits often set emissions limits for certain air pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen. In addition, various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety requirements, such as fire requirements and treated and storm water discharge requirements, apply to some of our properties. Our ability to comply with, as well as changes to, applicable regulations, such as air quality regulations, or the permit requirements for equipment at our facilities, could hinder or prevent our construction or operation of data center facilities.\n\nGovernmental authorities have in the past sought to restrict data center development based on environmental considerations. For example, governmental authorities in locations where we operate have imposed moratoria on data center development, citing concerns about energy usage and requiring new data centers to meet energy efficiency requirements. Some government agencies have also sought to restrict the use of diesel generators for back-up power. We may face higher costs from any laws requiring enhanced energy efficiency measures, changes to cooling systems, caps on energy usage, land use restrictions, limitations on back-up power sources, or other environmental requirements. Moratoria on data center construction could hinder our ability to construct new data centers.\n\nAlso, drought conditions in certain markets have resulted in water usage restrictions and proposals to further restrict water usage. Our data center facilities could face restrictions on water usage, water efficiency mandates, or higher water prices. Climate change could also limit water availability. In addition, sea level rise and more frequent and severe weather events caused or contributed to by climate change pose physical risks to our facilities. Additional risks related to our business and operations as a result of climate change include both physical and transition risks such as: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Higher energy costs (e.g., due to more extreme weather events, extreme temperatures or increased demand for limited resources); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Increased environmental regulations impacting the cost to develop, or the ability to develop in certain areas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Higher costs of materials due to environmental impacts from extraction and processing of raw materials and production of finished goods; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Higher costs of supply chain services, with potential supply chain disruptions related to climate change; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Lost revenue or higher expenses related to climate change events (e.g., higher insurance costs, uninsured losses, diminished customer retention in areas subject to extreme weather or resource availability constraints). ##TABLE_END \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe environmental laws and regulations to which our properties are subject may change in the future, and new laws and regulations may be created. Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability. Such laws include those directly regulating our climate change impacts and those which regulate the climate change impacts of companies with which we do business, such as utilities providing our facilities with electricity. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Regulations&#8212;Environmental Matters&#8212;Climate change legislation.&#8221; We do not know if or how the requirements will change, but changes may require that we make significant unanticipated expenditures, and such expenditures may materially adversely impact our financial condition, cash flow, results of operations, cash available for distributions, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock&#8217;s per share trading price, our competitive position and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\n\nOur properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem. \n\nWhen excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may grow, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants, such as Legionella, at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our customers, their employees, our employees and others if property damage or health concerns arise.\n\nWe may incur significant costs complying with applicable laws and governmental regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n\nOur business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, including those imposed by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the NYSE, as well as applicable local, state, and national labor laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties and increased costs of compliance.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with the ADA or similar laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio does not comply with the ADA or such other laws, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other laws. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA and any other similar legislation or are subject to awards of damages to private litigants, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe properties in our portfolio are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations. If we fail to comply with these various regulations, we may have to pay fines or damage awards to private litigants. In addition, we do not know whether existing regulations will change or whether future regulations will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOur business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. \n\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Furthermore, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting with respect to entities that we do not control or manage may be substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to the subsidiaries that we have controlled or managed over the course of time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity . \n\n&#8203; \n\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure \n\n&#8203; \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s duty to its stockholders may conflict with the interests of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders. \n\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and its stockholders, on the one hand, and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and its partners, on the other. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors and officers have duties to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and its stockholders under Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, Digital Realty Trust, Inc., as general partner, has fiduciary duties under Maryland law to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and to the limited partners in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s duties as general partner to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors and officers to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and its stockholders. Under Maryland law, a general partner of a Maryland limited partnership owes its limited partners the duties of loyalty and care, which must be discharged consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing, unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise. The partnership agreement of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. provides that for so long as Digital Realty Trust, Inc. owns a controlling interest in Digital Realty Trust, L.P., any conflict that cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders or the limited partners will be resolved in favor of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders.\n\nThe provisions of Maryland law that allow the fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been tested in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s fiduciary duties.\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders are also subject to the following additional conflict of interest:\n\nTax consequences upon sale or refinancing. Sales of properties and repayment of certain indebtedness will affect holders of common units in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders differently. Consequently, these holders of common units in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has exclusive authority under the partnership agreement of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, such decisions may require the approval of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors. Certain of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter, Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s partnership agreement and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. \n\nThese provisions include the following:\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter, including the articles supplementary governing its preferred stock, contains 9.8% ownership limits. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock, 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of any series of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s preferred stock and 9.8% of the value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s outstanding capital stock. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. However, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose direct or indirect ownership of more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock, more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of any series of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s preferred stock or more than 9.8% of the value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s outstanding capital stock could jeopardize Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required for REIT qualification. The ownership limit may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might be in the best interest of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders.\n\nDigital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s partnership agreement contains provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction. Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s partnership agreement provides that Digital Realty Trust, Inc. may not engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination with or into another person, any sale of all or substantially all of its assets or any reclassification, recapitalization or change of its outstanding equity interests unless the transaction is approved by the holders of common units and long-term incentive units representing at least 35% of the aggregate percentage interests of all holders of common units and long-term incentive units and either:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; all limited partners will receive, or have the right to elect to receive, for each common unit an amount of cash, securities or other property equal to the product of the number of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock into which a common unit is then exchangeable and the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property paid in consideration of each share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock in connection with the transaction (provided that, if, in connection with the transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange offer is made to and accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock, each holder of common units will receive, or have the right to elect to receive, the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property which such holder would have received if it exercised its right to redemption and received shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock in exchange for its common units immediately prior to the expiration of such purchase, tender or exchange offer and thereupon accepted such purchase, tender or exchange offer and the transaction was then consummated); or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the following conditions are met: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o substantially all of the assets directly or indirectly owned by the surviving entity in the transaction are held directly or indirectly by Digital Realty Trust, L.P. or another limited partnership or limited liability company which is the survivor of a merger, consolidation or combination of assets with Digital Realty Trust, L.P., which we refer to as the surviving partnership; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o the holders of common units and long-term incentive units own a percentage interest of the surviving partnership based on the relative fair market value of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s net assets and the other net assets of the surviving partnership immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START o the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of interests in the surviving partnership are at least as favorable as those in effect immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction and as those applicable to any other limited partners or non-managing members of the surviving partnership; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o the rights of the limited partners or non-managing members of the surviving partnership include at least one of the following: (i) the right to redeem their interests in the surviving partnership for the consideration available to such persons pursuant to Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s partnership agreement; or (ii) the right to redeem their interests for cash on terms equivalent to those in effect with respect to their common units immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction (or, if the ultimate controlling person of the surviving partnership has publicly traded common equity securities, for such common equity securities, with an exchange ratio based on the determination of relative fair market value of such securities and the shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock). ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThese provisions may discourage others from trying to acquire control of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might be beneficial to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders.\n\nThe change of control conversion features of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s preferred stock may make it more difficult for a party to take over our Company or discourage a party from taking over our Company. Upon the occurrence of specified change of control transactions, holders of our series J preferred stock, series K preferred stock and series L preferred stock will have the right (unless, prior to the change of control conversion date, we have provided or provide notice of our election to redeem such preferred stock) to convert some or all of their series J preferred stock, series K preferred stock or series L preferred stock, as applicable, into shares of our common stock (or equivalent value of alternative consideration), subject to caps set forth in the articles supplementary governing the applicable series of preferred stock. The change of control conversion features of the series J preferred stock, series K preferred stock and series L preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain change of control transactions of our Company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock, series J preferred stock, series K preferred stock and series L preferred stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. could increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of stock and issue stock without stockholder approval. Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter authorizes Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of stock of any class or series, to issue authorized but unissued shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock or preferred stock and, subject to the voting rights of holders of preferred stock, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock or preferred stock into other classes of series of stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of such classified or reclassified shares. Although Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors has no such intention at the present time, it could establish an additional class or series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might be in the best interest of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders.\n\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of impeding a third party from making a proposal to acquire Digital Realty Trust, Inc. or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interests of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders, including:\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; &#8220;business combination&#8221; provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s then outstanding shares of stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose special appraisal rights and supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; &#8220;control share&#8221; provisions that provide that &#8220;control shares&#8221; of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a &#8220;control share acquisition&#8221; (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding &#8220;control shares&#8221;) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. ##TABLE_END \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. has opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL by resolution of its Board of Directors, and in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in its bylaws. However, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL and Digital Realty Trust, Inc. may, by amendment to its bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future.\n\nThe provisions of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter governing removal of directors and the advance notice provisions of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might be in the best interests of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders. Likewise, if Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s board of directors were to opt in to the business combination provisions of the MGCL or the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL not currently applicable to Digital Realty Trust, Inc., or if the provision in Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were rescinded, these provisions of the MGCL could have similar anti-takeover effects.\n\nThe conversion rights of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock. \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. currently has 8,000,000 shares of 5.250% series J cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding, 8,400,000 shares of 5.850% series K cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding and 13,800,000 shares of 5.200% series L cumulative redeemable preferred stock outstanding which may be converted into Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock upon the occurrence of limited specified change in control transactions. The conversion of the series J preferred stock, series K preferred stock or series L preferred stock for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and unitholder ownership in Digital Realty Trust, L.P., and could adversely affect the market price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s rights and the rights of its stockholders to take action against its directors and officers are limited. \n\nMaryland law provides that Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors have no liability in their capacities as directors if they perform their duties in good faith, in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the Company&#8217;s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. As permitted by the MGCL, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter limits the liability of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors and officers to the Company and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated. ##TABLE_END \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn addition, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter authorizes Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to obligate itself, and Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s bylaws require it, to indemnify Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Further, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers. As a result, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and its stockholders may have more limited rights against its directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s directors or officers impede the performance of the Company, the Company&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; ability to recover damages from that director or officer will be limited.\n\nRisks Related to Taxes and Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Status as a REIT \n\nFailure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and its stockholders and to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and its unitholders. \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. has operated and intends to continue operating in a manner that it believes will allow it to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, that it qualifies as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, or Treasury Regulations, is greater in the case of a REIT that, like Digital Realty Trust, Inc., holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s control may affect its ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of its stock, requirements regarding the composition of its assets and requirements regarding the source of its income. Also, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gains.\n\nIf Digital Realty Trust, Inc. loses its REIT status, it will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce its cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay dividends to its stockholders, for each of the years involved because:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Digital Realty Trust, Inc. would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes on its taxable income; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Digital Realty Trust, Inc. also could be subject to federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; unless Digital Realty Trust, Inc. is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified. ##TABLE_END \n\nIn addition, if Digital Realty Trust, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT, it will not be required to make distributions to common stockholders, and accordingly, distributions Digital Realty Trust, L.P. makes to its unitholders could be similarly reduced. As a result of all these factors, Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially adversely affect the value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s units.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn certain circumstances, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. may be subject to federal and state taxes as a REIT, which would reduce its cash available for distribution to its stockholders. \n\nEven if Digital Realty Trust, Inc. qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on its income or property and, in certain cases, a 100% penalty tax, in the event it sells property as a dealer. In addition, our domestic corporate subsidiary, Digital Services, Inc., which is a taxable REIT subsidiary of Digital Realty Trust, Inc., could be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and our foreign properties and companies are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are located. A domestic taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a taxable REIT subsidiary and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm&#8217;s length basis. Any federal, state or foreign taxes Digital Realty Trust, Inc. pays will reduce its cash available for distribution to stockholders.\n\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. \n\nThe maximum tax rate applicable to &#8220;qualified dividend income&#8221; payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for these reduced rates. U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (i.e., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends treated as qualified dividend income, which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s capital stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in &#8220;prohibited transactions&#8221; may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. \n\nA REIT&#8217;s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.\n\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. \n\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, its sources of income, the nature and diversification of its assets (including its proportionate share of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s assets), the amounts it distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its capital stock. If Digital Realty Trust, Inc. were to fail to comply with one or more of the asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter, it would need to correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo investments we might otherwise make or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance and reduce amounts available for distribution to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders.\n\nThe power of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s Board of Directors to revoke Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s charter provides that its Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate its REIT election, without the approval of its stockholders, if the Board determines that it is no longer in Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If Digital Realty Trust, Inc. ceases to qualify as a REIT, it would become subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes on its taxable income and it would no longer be required to distribute most of its taxable income to its stockholders and, accordingly, distributions Digital Realty Trust, L.P. makes to its unitholders could be similarly reduced.\n\nIf Digital Realty Trust L.P. were to fail to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. would fail to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. \n\nWe believe that Digital Realty Trust, L.P. has been organized and operated in a manner that will allow it to be treated as a partnership, and not an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, Digital Realty Trust, L.P. is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including Digital Realty Trust, Inc., is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, that partner&#8217;s share of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating Digital Realty Trust, L.P. as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, would cease to qualify as a REIT. Such REIT qualification failure could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would materially adversely affect the value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s units. Also, the failure of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of its cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including Digital Realty Trust, Inc.\n\nChanges in U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, including changes to tax rates, legislation and other actions may adversely affect our results of operations, our stockholders, Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders and us. \n\nWe are headquartered in the United States with subsidiaries and operations globally and are subject to income taxes in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that additional taxes will not be due upon audit of our tax returns or as a result of changes to applicable tax laws. The governments of many of the countries in which we operate may enact changes to the tax laws of such countries, including changes to the corporate recognition and taxation of worldwide income. The nature and timing of any changes to each jurisdiction&#8217;s tax laws and the impact on our future tax liabilities cannot be predicted with any accuracy but could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAdditionally, each of our properties is subject to real property and personal property taxes. These taxes may increase as tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. Any increase in property taxes on our properties could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\n\nFurther, the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s stockholders, Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders and us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors and us. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Moreover, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nTax liabilities and attributes inherited in connection with acquisitions may adversely impact our business. \n\nFrom time to time we may acquire other corporations or entities and, in connection with such acquisitions, we may succeed to the historic tax attributes and liabilities of such entities. For example, if we acquire a C corporation and subsequently dispose of its assets within five years of the acquisition, we could be required to pay tax on any built-in gain attributable to such assets determined as of the date on which we acquired the assets. In addition, in order to qualify as a REIT, at the end of any taxable year, we must not have any earnings and profits accumulated in a non-REIT year. As a result, if we acquire a C corporation, we must distribute the corporation&#8217;s earnings and profits accumulated prior to the acquisition before the end of the taxable year in which we acquire the corporation. We also could be required to pay the acquired entity&#8217;s unpaid taxes even though such liabilities arose prior to the time we acquired the entity. \n\nForward-Looking Statements \n\nWe make statements in this report that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221;\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 as compared to 2021 is presented herein. Information on 2020 is presented in graphs and other tables only to show year-over-year trends in our results of operations and operating metrics. Our financial condition for 2020 and results of operations for 2020 &#8211; and also 2020 as compared to 2021 &#8211; can be found under Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022.\n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc., through its controlling interest in Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and its subsidiaries, delivers comprehensive space, power, and interconnection solutions that enable its customers and partners to connect with each other and service their own customers on a global technology and real estate platform. We are a leading global provider of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions for customers across a variety of industry verticals. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. operates as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and our Operating Partnership is the entity through which we conduct our business and own our assets.\n\nOur primary business objectives are to maximize: \n\n##TABLE_START (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and Digital Realty Trust, L.P.&#8217;s unitholders through the payment of distributions; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (iii) return on invested capital. ##TABLE_END \n\nWe expect to accomplish our objectives by achieving superior risk-adjusted returns, prudently allocating capital, diversifying our product offerings, accelerating our global reach and scale, and driving revenue growth and operating efficiencies. A significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development, acquisition of land for future development, and acquisition of new properties. \n\nWe target high-quality, strategically located properties containing the physical and connectivity infrastructure that supports the applications and operations of data center and technology industry customers and properties that may be developed for such use. Most of our data center properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. Fundamentally, we bring together foundational real estate and innovative technology expertise around the world to deliver a comprehensive, dedicated product suite to meet customers&#8217; data and connectivity needs. We represent an important part of the digital economy that we believe will benefit from powerful, long-term growth drivers.\n\nWe have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. We expect to continue to acquire additional assets as part of our growth strategy. We intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. We may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated demand and returns.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. Debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock and preferred stock. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our goal is to average through business cycles the following financial ratios: 1) a debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5x, 2) a fixed charge coverage of greater than three times, and 3) floating rate debt at less than 20% of total outstanding debt. In addition, we strive to maintain a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, and we seek to maximize the menu of our available sources of capital, while minimizing the cost.\n\nSummary of 2022 Significant Activities \n\nWe completed the following significant activities in 2022 as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; In January, we issued and sold &#8364;750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% Guaranteed Notes due 2032 (the &#8220;2032 Notes&#8221;). The 2032 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately &#8364;737.5 million (approximately $835.3 million based on the exchange rate on January 18, 2022) after deducting managers&#8217; discounts and estimated offering expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In February, we redeemed $450.0 million of 4.750% Notes due 2025. As part of this redemption, we recorded a $51.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In March, we issued and sold CHF 100 million aggregate principal amount of 0.600% Guaranteed Notes due 2023 (the &#8220;2023 Notes&#8221;) and CHF 150 million aggregate principal amount of 1.700% Guaranteed Notes due 2027 (the &#8220;2027 Notes&#8221; and, together with the 2023 Notes, the &#8220;Swiss Franc Notes&#8221;). The Swiss Franc Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. Net proceeds from the offering of the Swiss Franc Notes were approximately CHF 248.6 million (approximately $269.2 million based on the exchange rate on March 30, 2022) after deducting the managers&#8217; commissions and certain offering expenses. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In June, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Mivne Real Estate (K.D.). The joint venture will operate under the brand name Digital Realty Mivne and will develop a multi-tenant data center campus in Israel. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In July, we partially settled the September 2021 forward sale agreements by issuing approximately 2.7 million shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $400.0 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In August, we closed the acquisition of 61.1% indirect controlling interest in Teraco, a leading carrier-neutral colocation provider in South Africa, for total cash consideration of $1.7 billion in a transaction valuing Teraco at approximately $3.3 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In August, we sold a non-core building in Dallas for net proceeds of $203 million resulting in a net gain on sale of $174 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In August, we entered into a term loan agreement, comprised of a &#8364;375.0 million three-year senior unsecured term loan facility and a &#8364;375.0 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility. The term loans were funded in August (&#8364;500.0 million) and in September (&#8364;250.0 million). The interest rate for borrowings under the term loans is based on EURIBO, plus a margin based on the corporate credit rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; In September, we completed an underwritten public offering of $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Operating Partnership&#8217;s 5.550% Notes due 2028 (the &#8220;2028 Notes&#8221;). Our Operating Partnership&#8217;s obligations under the 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Net proceeds from the offering of the 2028 Notes were approximately $544.5 million, after deducting the managers&#8217; commissions and certain offering expenses . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In November, we physically settled the remaining portion of the September 2021 forward sale agreements in full by issuing an aggregate of approximately 3.6 million shares of our common stock, resulting in proceeds of approximately $539 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In December, we completed an underwritten public offering of an additional $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. Net proceeds from the offering of the additional 2028 Notes were approximately $343.9 million, after deducting the managers&#8217; commissions and certain offering expenses. ##TABLE_END \n\nRevenue Base \n\nMost of our revenue consists of rental income generated by the data centers in our portfolio. Our ability to generate and grow revenue depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve occupancy rates. A summary of our data center portfolio and related square feet occupied (excluding space under development or held for development) is shown below. Unconsolidated portfolios shown below consist of assets owned by unconsolidated entities in which we have invested. We often provide management services for these entities under management agreements and receive management fees. These are shown as Managed Unconsolidated Portfolio. Entities for which we do not provide such services are shown as Non-Managed Unconsolidated Portfolio.\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2021 \n\nRegion \n\n&#8203; \n\nData Center Buildings \n\nNet Rentable Square Feet (1) \n\nSpace Under Active Development (2) \n\nSpace Held for Development (3) \n\nOccupancy \n\n&#8203; \n\nData Center Buildings \n\nNet Rentable Square Feet (1) \n\nSpace Under Active Development (2) \n\nSpace Held for Development (3) \n\nOccupancy \n\nNorth America\n\n&#8203; \n\n21,894 \n\n3,165 \n\n1,110 \n\n86.28 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n21,752 \n\n2,327 \n\n85.4 \n\n%\n\nEurope\n\n&#8203; \n\n7,936 \n\n4,265 \n\n79.28 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n7,549 \n\n3,125 \n\n74.6 \n\n%\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n&#8203; \n\n1,653 \n\n88 \n\n75.94 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n1,355 \n\n&#8212; \n\n76.2 \n\n%\n\nAfrica\n\n&#8203; \n\n1,184 \n\n&#8212; \n\n70.19 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n26 \n\n&#8212; \n\n58.5 \n\n%\n\nConsolidated Portfolio \n\n&#8203; \n\n32,667 \n\n8,346 \n\n1,424 \n\n83.50 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n30,682 \n\n6,299 \n\n1,091 \n\n82.5 \n\n%\n\nManaged Unconsolidated Portfolio\n\n&#8203; \n\n2,389 \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\n98.44 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n2,384 \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8212; \n\n95.2 \n\n%\n\nNon-Managed Unconsolidated Portfolio\n\n&#8203; \n\n3,100 \n\n1,915 \n\n87.05 \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n2,565 \n\n1,591 \n\n86.0 \n\n%\n\nTotal Portfolio \n\n&#8203; \n\n38,156 \n\n8,872 \n\n3,339 \n\n84.72 \n\n% \n\n&#8203; \n\n35,631 \n\n7,230 \n\n2,682 \n\n83.6 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Net rentable square feet represents the current square feet under lease as specified in the applicable lease agreement plus management&#8217;s estimate of space available for lease based on engineering drawings.

Our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our data centers will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. Further, re-leased/renewed rental rates in a particular metropolitan area may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local economic conditions, local supply and demand for data center space, competition from other data center developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nGeographic concentration \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe depend on the market for data centers in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional or metropolitan areas can impact our future results.

Includes consolidated portfolio and unconsolidated entities at the entities&#8217; 100% ownership level. The aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $117.3 million. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses primarily consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, and rental expenses on our ground and building leases. Our buildings require significant power to support data center operations and the cost of electric power and other utilities is a significant component of operating expenses.\n\nMany of our leases contain provisions under which tenants reimburse us for all or a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. However, in some cases we are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for Turn-Key Flex&#174; facilities. We expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand. \n\nCosts pertaining to our asset management function, legal, accounting, corporate governance, reporting and compliance are categorized as general and administrative costs within operating expenses. \n\nOther key components of operating expenses include: depreciation of our fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, and transaction and integration costs.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther Income / (Expenses) \n\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities, gain on disposition of properties, interest expense, and income tax expense make up the majority of other income/(expense). Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities represents our share of the income/(loss) of entities in which we invest, but do not consolidate under U.S. GAAP. The largest of these investments is currently our investment in Ascenty, which is located primarily in Latin America. Our second-largest equity-method investment is Digital Core REIT, which is publicly traded on the Singapore Exchange (&#8220;SGX&#8221;) and which owns a portfolio of 11 properties operating in the United States, Canada and Germany. Refer to additional discussion of Digital Core REIT and Ascenty in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nResults of Operations \n\nAs a result of the consistent and significant growth in our business since the first property acquisition in 2002, we evaluate period-to-period results for revenue and property level operating expenses on a stabilized versus non-stabilized portfolio basis.\n\n&#8203; \n\nStabilized: The stabilized portfolio includes properties owned as of the beginning of all periods presented with less than 5% of total rentable square feet under development. \n\nNon-stabilized: The non-stabilized portfolio includes: (1) properties that were undergoing, or were expected to undergo, development activities during any of the periods presented; (2) any properties contributed to joint ventures, sold, or held for sale during the periods presented; and (3) any properties that were acquired or delivered at any point during the periods presented.\n\nA roll forward showing changes in the stabilized and non-stabilized portfolios for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is shown below (in thousands). \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Rentable Square Feet \n\n&#160; \n\nStabilized \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-Stabilized \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\nAs of December 31, 2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n17,095 \n\n&#8203; \n\n13,587 \n\n&#8203; \n\n30,682 \n\nNew development and space reconfigurations\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,357 \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,393 \n\nTransfers to stabilized from nonstabilized\n\n&#8203; \n\n6,719 \n\n&#8203; \n\n(6,724) \n\n&#8203; \n\n(5) \n\nTransfers to nonstabilized from stabilized\n\n&#8203; \n\n(302) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(212) \n\nDispositions / Sales\n\n&#8203; \n\n(387) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(387) \n\nAcquisitions\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,197 \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,197 \n\nAs of December 31, 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\n23,160 \n\n&#8203; \n\n9,507 \n\n&#8203; \n\n32,667 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2022 to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nRevenues \n\nTotal operating revenues as shown on our consolidated income statements was as follows (in thousands):\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n$ Change \n\n&#160;\n\n% Change \n\nStabilized\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n3,447,294 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n3,492,704 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n(45,409) \n\n&#8203; \n\n(1.3) \n\n% \n\nNon-Stabilized\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,215,389 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n902,335 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n313,054 \n\n&#8203; \n\n34.7 \n\n% \n\nRental and other services\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n4,662,683 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n4,395,039 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n267,644 \n\n&#160;\n\n6.1 \n\n% \n\nFee income and other\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n29,151 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n32,843 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(3,692) \n\n&#160;\n\n(11.2) \n\n% \n\nTotal operating revenues\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n4,691,834 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n4,427,882 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n263,952 \n\n&#160;\n\n6.0 \n\n% \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nTotal operating revenues increased by approximately $264.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 driven primarily by growth in non-stabilized rental and other services revenue. \n\n&#8203; \n\nStabilized rental and other services revenue decreased by $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a $131.9 million unfavorable foreign currency translation effect (primarily related to weaking of the Euro and British pound sterling versus the U.S. dollar) partially offset by a net increase in tenant reimbursements related to higher utility consumption of $97.5 million.\n\n&#8203; \n\nNon-stabilized rental and other services revenue increased $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by: \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START (i) an increase of $368.3 million due to the completion of global development pipeline and related lease up operating activities, with $94.8 million generated from an APAC property, which came online in the second quarter of 2021 and was fully operational by the first quarter of 2022.

\n\nProperty level operating expenses include costs to operate and maintain the properties in our portfolio as well as taxes and insurance.\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal Utilities \n\nTotal stabilized utilities expenses increased by approximately $79.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in utility consumption and higher rates at certain properties in the stabilized portfolio of $116.5 million offset by a $37.1 million foreign currency translation effect.\n\nTotal non-stabilized utilities expenses increased by approximately $141.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to higher utility consumption in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites of $160.7 million offset by a $17.7 million foreign currency translation effect.\n\nTotal Rental Property Operating and Maintenance (Excluding Utilities) \n\nTotal stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses (excluding utilities) decreased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a $24.0 million foreign currency translation effect partially offset by an increase in common area maintenance utilities and repairs and maintenance of $20.9 million.\n\nTotal non-stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to higher lease and common area maintenance expense in a growing portfolio of recently completed development sites of approximately $51.6 million offset by a foreign currency translation effect primarily due to the Euro versus the U.S. dollar of approximately $12.5 million. \n\nThe cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. Any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that the U.S. Congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the U.S. EPA has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further legislation or regulations in the EU, APAC or other regions where we operate could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our customers. These matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nTotal Property Taxes and Insurance \n\nTotal stabilized property taxes and insurance decreased $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to $13.5 million of a reduction in property tax liabilities and property tax refunds spread across the portfolio, offset by a $1.6 million foreign currency translation effect.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther Operating Expenses \n\nOther operating expenses include costs which are either non-cash in nature (such as depreciation and amortization) or which do not directly pertain to operation of data center properties.

The decrease was due primarily to i) gain of approximately $1 billion on the disposition of 10 operating properties to the SREIT in December 2021, ii) gain of approximately $332.0 million in March 2021 associated with the sale of a portfolio of 11 data centers in Europe (four in the United Kingdom, three in the Netherlands, three in France and one in Switzerland) to Ascendas Reit, a CapitaLand sponsored REIT, for total purchase consideration of approximately $680.0 million, offset by iii) the disposition of a property in the Dallas market in August 2022 resulting in a net gain on sale of $174 million.\n\nLoss from Early Extinguishment of Debt \n\nLoss from early extinguishment of debt increased approximately $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to the redemption of the 4.750% Notes due 2025 in February 2022, which resulted in a $51.1 million loss, compared to the redemption 2.750% Notes due 2023 in February 2021, which resulted in a $18.3 million loss.\n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\nIncome tax expense decreased by $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was driven primarily by i) the release of the valuation allowances against net operating losses in the Netherlands and the inclusion of a Teraco tax benefit in 2022 and ii) an increase in the corporate tax rate that increased deferred tax expense in the United Kingdom from 19% to 25% during the quarter ended June 30, 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe sections &#8220;Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Parent&#8221; and &#8220;Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Operating Partnership&#8221; should be read in conjunction with one another to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. The term &#8220;Parent&#8221; refers to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our Operating Partnership. The term &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221; or &#8220;OP&#8221; refers to Digital Realty Trust, L.P. on a consolidated basis.\n\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Parent\n\nOur Parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time, incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company (which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership) and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. If our Operating Partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger Parent guarantee obligations, then our Parent will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. Our Parent&#8217;s only material asset is its investment in our Operating Partnership.\n\nOur Parent&#8217;s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. Our Parent&#8217;s principal source of funding is the distributions it receives from our Operating Partnership.\n\nAs the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, our Parent has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our Operating Partnership&#8217;s day-to-day management and control. Our Parent causes our Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our Parent may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our Operating Partnership&#8217;s partnership agreement. \n\nAs circumstances warrant, our Parent may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. Any proceeds from such equity issuances would generally be contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities.\n\nOur Parent and our Operating Partnership are parties to an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement dated April 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Sales Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. can issue and sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1.5 billion through various named agents from time to time. The sales of common stock made under the Sales Agreement will be made in &#8220;at the market&#8221; offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2022, $1.5 billion remained available for future sales under the program. Our Parent intends to use the net proceeds from the program to temporarily repay borrowings under our Operating Partnership&#8217;s global revolving credit facilities, to acquire additional properties or businesses, to fund development opportunities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potentially for the repayment of other debt or the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt securities.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOn September 13, 2021, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of its common stock, all of which were offered in connection with forward sale agreements it entered into with certain financial institutions acting as forward purchasers. The forward purchasers borrowed and sold an aggregate of 6,250,000 shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock in the public offering. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the forward purchasers in the public offering. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the forward sale agreements by issuing 6.25 million shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $939.0 million. Upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements, the Operating Partnership issued general partner common partnership units to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. in exchange for contribution of the net proceeds. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe believe our Operating Partnership&#8217;s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and funds available under its global revolving credit facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our Parent and, in turn, for our Parent to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. However, we cannot assure you that our Operating Partnership&#8217;s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including making distribution payments to our Parent. The lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our Operating Partnership&#8217;s ability to pay its distributions to our Parent, which would in turn, adversely affect our Parent&#8217;s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.\n\nFuture Uses of Cash &#8212; Parent\n\nOur Parent may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\n\nDividends and Distributions &#8212; Parent\n\nOur Parent is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our Parent intends to make, but is not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our Operating Partnership&#8217;s operating activities. While historically our Parent has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Parent&#8217;s Board of Directors. Our Parent considers market factors and our Operating Partnership&#8217;s performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. Our Parent has distributed at least 100% of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal and state income taxes. Amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our Parent&#8217;s status as a REIT.\n\nAs a result of this distribution requirement, our Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. Our Parent may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our Operating Partnership&#8217;s working capital needs, as well as potential developments at new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. In addition, our Parent may be required to use borrowings under the Operating Partnership&#8217;s global revolving credit facility (which is guaranteed by our Parent), if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our Parent&#8217;s REIT status.\n\nDistributions out of our Parent&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income whereas distributions in excess of our Parent&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax basis in our Parent&#8217;s stock, are generally classified as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of a stockholder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax basis in our Parent&#8217;s stock are generally characterized as capital gain. Cash provided by operating activities has been generally sufficient to fund distributions on an annual basis. However, we may also need to utilize borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to fund distributions.\n\nThe expected tax treatment of distributions on our Parent&#8217;s common stock and preferred stock paid in 2022 is as follows: approximately 59% ordinary income, 16% as capital gain distribution, and 25% as nondividend distribution. The tax treatment of distributions on our Parent&#8217;s common stock and preferred stock paid in 2021 was as follows: approximately 9% ordinary income and 91% capital gain distribution. The tax treatment of distributions on our Parent&#8217;s common stock paid in 2020 was as follows: approximately 72% ordinary income and 28% capital gain distribution. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nFor additional information regarding dividends declared and paid by our Parent on its common and preferred stock for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Item 8, Note 14. &#8220;Equity and Capital&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.\n\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8212; Operating Partnership\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $141.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding $8.9 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily relates to future contractual capital expenditures plus other deposits. Our liquidity requirements primarily consist of:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; operating expenses, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; development costs and other capital expenditures associated with our properties, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; distributions to our Parent to enable it to make dividend payments, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; distributions to unitholders of common limited partnership interests in Digital Realty Trust, L.P., ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; debt service, and, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; potentially, acquisitions. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nOn November 18, 2021, we refinanced our global revolving credit facility and Yen revolving credit facility. On April 5, 2022, the Operating Partnership entered into an amendment of the global revolving credit facility which, among other things, increased the size of the global revolving credit facility from $3.0 billion to $3.75 billion. The global revolving credit facilities provide for borrowings of up to $4.05 billion (including approximately $0.3 billion available to be drawn on the Yen revolving credit facility). The global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies and can be increased by an additional $750 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Both facilities mature on January 24, 2026, with two six-month extension options available. \n\nThese facilities also feature a sustainability-linked pricing component, with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our continued leadership and commitment to sustainable business practices.\n\nThe global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings in a variety of currencies, and includes the ability to add additional currencies in the future. We have used and intend to use available borrowings under the global revolving credit facilities to acquire additional properties, fund development opportunities and for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities. For additional information regarding our global revolving credit facilities, see Item 8, Note 11. &#8220;Debt of the Operating Partnership&#8221; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFuture Uses of Cash \n\nOur properties require periodic investments of capital for customer-related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements. Depending upon customer demand, we expect to incur significant improvement costs to build out and develop additional capacity. At December 31, 2022, we had open commitments, related to construction contracts of approximately $2.6 billion, including amounts reimbursable of approximately $41.5 million.\n\nWe currently expect to incur approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of capital expenditures for our development programs during the year ending December 31, 2023. This amount could go up or down, potentially materially, based on numerous factors, including changes in demand, leasing results and availability of debt or equity capital.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nDevelopment Projects \n\nThe costs we incur to develop our properties is a key component of our liquidity requirements. The following table summarizes our cumulative investments in current development projects as well as expected future investments in these projects as of the periods presented, excluding costs incurred or to be incurred by unconsolidated entities. \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDevelopment Lifecycle \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Rentable \n\n&#8203; \n\nCurrent \n\n&#8203; \n\nFuture \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Rentable \n\n&#8203; \n\nCurrent \n\n&#8203; \n\nFuture \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(in thousands) \n\n&#160; \n\nSquare Feet (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment (3) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Cost \n\n&#160; \n\nSquare Feet (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment (4) \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment (3) \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Cost \n\nLand held for future development (5) \n\n&#160; &#8203; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160;\n\n$ \n\n118,452 \n\n&#160;\n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n$ \n\n118,452 \n\n&#160; &#8203; \n\nN/A \n\n&#160;\n\n$ \n\n133,683 \n\n&#160;\n\n$ \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n$ \n\n133,683 \n\nConstruction in Progress and Space Held for Development \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\nLand - Current Development (5) \n\n&#8203; \n\nN/A\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,118,954 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,118,954 \n\n&#8203; \n\nN/A\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n974,464 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n974,464 \n\nSpace Held for Development (6) \n\n&#160;\n\n1,437 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n245,483 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n245,483 \n\n&#160;\n\n1,091 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n210,903 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n210,903 \n\nBase Building Construction\n\n&#160;\n\n3,918 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n693,926 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n649,640 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n1,343,566 \n\n&#160;\n\n3,320 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n545,529 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n460,595 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,006,124 \n\nData Center Construction\n\n&#160;\n\n4,802 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n2,180,060 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,299,457 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n5,479,517 \n\n&#160;\n\n2,980 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,409,403 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,825,369 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,234,772 \n\nEquipment Pool and Other Inventory\n\n&#160;\n\nN/A\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n32,409 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n32,409 \n\n&#160;\n\nN/A\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n7,881 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n7,881 \n\nCampus, Tenant Improvements and Other\n\n&#160;\n\nN/A\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n518,302 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n169,756 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n688,058 \n\n&#160;\n\nN/A\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n65,209 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n99,118 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n164,327 \n\nTotal Construction in Progress and Land Held for Future Development \n\n&#160; \n\n10,157 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n4,907,586 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n4,118,853 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n9,026,439 \n\n&#160; \n\n7,391 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n3,347,072 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n2,385,082 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n5,732,154 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) We estimate the total net rentable square feet available for lease based on a number of factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including available power, required support space and common areas.

Base building construction consists of ongoing improvements to building infrastructure in preparation for future data center fit-out. Data center construction includes 8.7 million square feet of Turn Key Flex &#174; and Powered Base Building &#174; product. Generally, we expect to deliver the space within 12 months; however, lease commencement dates may significantly impact final delivery schedules. Equipment pool and other inventory represent the value of long-lead equipment and materials required for timely deployment and delivery of data center construction fit-out. Campus, tenant improvements and other costs include the value of development work which benefits space recently converted to our operating portfolio and is composed primarily of shared infrastructure projects and first-generation tenant improvements.\n\nCapital Expenditures (Cash Basis) \n\nThe table below summarizes our capital expenditure activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDevelopment projects\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,210,790 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,176,203 \n\nEnhancement and improvements\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n12,291 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,812 \n\nRecurring capital expenditures\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n266,466 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n217,103 \n\nTotal capital expenditures (excluding indirect costs)\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,489,547 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,396,118 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, total capital expenditures increased $93.4 million to approximately $2,489.5 million from $2,396.1 million for the same period in 2021. Capital expenditures on our development projects plus our enhancement and improvements projects for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $2,223.1 million, which reflects an increase of approximately 2% from the same period in 2021. Our development capital expenditures are generally funded by our available cash and equity and debt capital.\n\nIndirect costs, including interest, capitalized in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $156.9 million and $124.7 million, respectively. Capitalized interest comprised approximately $70.8 million and $53.5 million of the total indirect costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capitalized interest in the year ended December 31, 2022 increased, compared to the same period in 2021, due to an increase in interest rates and qualifying activities. Excluding capitalized interest, indirect costs in the year ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to increasing compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction activities. \n\nConsistent with our growth strategy, we actively pursue potential acquisition opportunities, with due diligence and negotiations often at different stages at different times. The dollar value of acquisitions for the year ending December 31, 2023 will depend upon numerous factors, including customer demand, leasing results, availability of debt or equity capital and acquisition opportunities. Further, the growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower, as such private investors may often have lower return expectations than us. As a result, we anticipate near-term single asset acquisitions activity to comprise a smaller percentage of our growth while this market dynamic persists.\n\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or the equity of our Parent through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities of our Parent in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\n\nSources of Cash \n\nWe expect to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of scheduled debt maturities and funding of acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of equity issuances by our Parent. We also may fund future short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, using our global revolving credit facilities pending permanent financing. As of February 21, 2023, we had approximately $1.8 billion of borrowings available under our global revolving credit facilities. \n\nOur global revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $3.75 billion. We have the ability from time to time to increase the size of the global revolving credit facility by up to $750 million, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. The global revolving credit facility matures on January 24, 2026, with two six-month extension options available. We have used and intend to use available borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity requirements from time to time. For additional information regarding our global revolving credit facility, see Note 11. &#8220;Debt of the Operating Partnership&#8221; to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOn August 11, 2022, Digital Dutch Finco B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, entered into a term loan agreement (the &#8220;Euro Term Loan Agreement&#8221;) which governs (i) a &#8364;375.0 million three-year senior unsecured term loan facility (the &#8220;2025 Term Facility&#8221;), the entire amount of which was funded on the closing date, and (ii) a &#8364;375.0 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility (the &#8220;2025-27 Term Facility&#8221; and, together with the 2025 Term Facility, the &#8220;Euro Term Facilities&#8221;), comprised of &#8364;125.0 million of initial term loans, the entire amount of which was funded on the closing date, and &#8364;250.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments that were not funded on the closing date, and were funded on September 9, 2022. The Euro Term Facilities provide for borrowings in Euros. The 2025 Term Facility matures on August 11, 2025. The 2025-27 Term Facility matures on August 11, 2025, subject to two maturity extension options of one year each. The interest rate for borrowings under the Euro Term Facilities is based on EURIBO, plus a margin based on the corporate credit rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt of between 0.80% and 1.60% per annum. As of the closing date, the applicable rate for borrowings is EURIBO plus 0.95% per annum. We are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Euro Term Facilities. The Euro Term Facilities may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Euro Term Facilities and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and certain of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s subsidiaries entered into an escrow agreement (the &#8220;Escrow Agreement&#8221;) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221;), certain lenders (the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;), and Arnold &#38; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, as escrow agent (the &#8220;Escrow Agent&#8221;), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership, the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders delivered executed signature pages to a new term loan agreement among the Operating Partnership, the Company, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Term Loan Agreement&#8221;) to be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent and released by the Escrow Agent upon satisfaction of specific terms. On January 9, 2023, the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement were satisfied, and, on such date, the Term Loan was deemed executed and became effective. The Term Loan Agreement provides for a $740 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the &#8220;Term Loan Facility&#8221;). The Term Loan Facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars. The Term Loan Facility will mature on March 31, 2025, subject to one twelve-month extension at the Operating Partnership&#8217;s option; provided, that the Operating Partnership must pay a 0.1875% extension fee based on the then-outstanding principal amount of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility.\n\n&#8203; \n\nDistributions\n\nAll distributions on our units are at the discretion of our Parent&#8217;s Board of Directors.

The bank group is obligated to grant the extension options provided we give proper notice, we make certain representations and warranties and no default exists under the global revolving credit facilities, as applicable. ##TABLE_END \n\nOur ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 35% (based on the closing price of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock on December 31, 2022 of $100.27). For this purpose, our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), plus the liquidation value of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of our Operating Partnership&#8217;s units not held by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, Class C units and Class D units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness. \n\nThe variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various one-month SOFR, EURIBOR, SORA, BBR, HIBOR, TIBOR, Base CD Rate and CDOR rates, depending on the respective agreement governing the debt, including our global revolving credit facilities and unsecured term loans. As of December 31, 2022 our debt had a weighted average term to initial maturity of approximately 5.2 years (or approximately 5.3 years assuming exercise of extension options). \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our pro-rata share of secured debt of unconsolidated entities was approximately $908.8 million.\n\nCash Flows \n\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\n\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2022 to Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nThe following table shows cash flows and ending cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances for the respective periods (in thousands).\n\n&#8203;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (ii) an increase in cash provided by proceeds from secured / unsecured debt and the issuance of notes in 2022 (2032 Notes in January 2022, Swiss Franc Notes in March 2022, Euro Term Loan in August 2022, 2028 Notes in September and December 2022), offset by debt issuances in 2021 (2031 Notes in January 2021 and Swiss Franc Notes in July 2021); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (iii) an increase in cash used for repayment of unsecured notes (in 2022, we redeemed the 4.750% Notes due 2025 ($450 million); in 2021, we redeemed 2.750% Notes due 2023 ($300 million) and paid down the remaining balance of our unsecured term loan ($537 million)); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (iv) an increase in dividend and distribution payments due to an increased dividend amount per share of common stock and common unit; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (v) an increase due to the settlement of forward sale agreements in July and December 2022, offset with the proceeds from the ATM program in 2021. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nNoncontrolling Interests in Operating Partnership\n\nNoncontrolling interests relate to the common units in our Operating Partnership that are not owned by Digital Realty Trust, Inc., which, as of December 31, 2022, amounted to 2.1% of our Operating Partnership common units. Historically, our Operating Partnership has issued common units to third party sellers in connection with our acquisition of real estate interests from such third parties.\n\nLimited partners have the right to require our Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 0.2 million common units of the Operating Partnership that were issued to certain former unitholders of DuPont Fabros Technology, L.P. in connection with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. were outstanding, which are subject to certain restrictions and, accordingly, are not presented as permanent capital in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nInflation\n\nMany of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our global revolving credit facilities, borrowings under our unsecured term loans and issuances of unsecured senior notes.\n\nIn addition, refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion about risks that inflation directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nA critical accounting policy is one that involves management&#8217;s use of judgement regarding expected outcomes of uncertain events in order to make estimates and assumptions that are material to an entity&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. Though we base our estimates and assumptions regarding these matters on historical and current conditions as well as future expectations, these estimates and assumptions are subjective in nature. Changes to the estimates and assumptions we make regarding these matters could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in the evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the subsequent items have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies. Refer to Note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies. \n\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is intended to reflect the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). We use fair value measurements to enable us to determine the fair value of a variety of items. Fair value measurements are most significant to our financial statements in the following areas: 1) evaluation of recoverability of real estate and intangible assets (which involves comparison of fair value of the assets to net book value to quantify any potential impairments), 2) accounting for assets held for sale (which involves recording assets qualifying for held for sale treatment at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell), and 3) determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business combinations or asset acquisitions as well as certain equity interests in unconsolidated entities. \n\nWe estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methods we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Given the significant amount of judgement and subjectivity involved in the determination of fair value, estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of amounts that would be realized on disposition. Refer to Note 2. &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets. We assess the carrying value of our properties whenever events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable (&#8220;triggering events\"). Triggering events typically relate to a change in the expected holding period of a property, an adverse change in expected future cash flows of the property, or a trend of past cash flow losses that is expected to continue in the future. If our assessment of triggering events indicates the carrying value of a property or asset group might not be recoverable, we estimate the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and compare that amount to the book value of the assets. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates we are unable to recover the carrying value of a property or asset group, we record an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the property or asset group exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 2. &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nConsolidation. We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned as well as all partially-owned entities that we control. In addition, we consolidate any variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) for which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate whether or not an entity is a VIE (and we are the primary beneficiary) through consideration of substantive terms in the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses/receive benefits from the entity. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nFor entities that do not meet the definition of VIEs, we first consider if we are the general partner or a limited partner (or the equivalent in investments not structured as partnerships). We consolidate entities in which we are the general partner and the limited partners do not have rights that would preclude control. For entities in which we are the general partner, but the limited partners hold substantive participating or kick-out rights that prohibit our ability to control the entity, we apply the equity method of accounting since, as the general partner, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the entities. For entities in which we are a limited partner, or that are not structured similar to a partnership, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners. When factors indicate we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, we consolidate the entity. Refer to Note 8. &#8220;Investments in Unconsolidated Entities&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nRevenue Recognition. We generate the majority of our revenue by leasing our properties to customers under operating lease agreements, which are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (&#8220;ASC 842&#8221;). We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term if we determine it is probable that substantially all of the lease payments will be collected over the lease term. \n\nWe estimate the probability of collection of lease payments based on customer creditworthiness, outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical bad debts &#8211; as well as current economic trends. If collection of substantially all lease payments over the lease term is not probable, rental revenue is recognized when payment is received, and we record a full valuation allowance on the balance of any rent receivable, less the balance of any security deposits or letters of credit. If collection is subsequently determined to be probable, we: 1) resume recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis, 2) record incremental revenue such that the cumulative amount recognized is equal to the amount that would have been recorded on a straight-line basis since inception of the lease, and 3) reverse the allowance for bad debt recorded on outstanding receivables. Refer to Note 5. &#8220;Receivables&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2. &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFunds From Operations\n\nWe calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit) in the Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, a gain from a pre-existing relationship, impairment charges and real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to other REITs&#8217; FFO. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nReconciliation of Net Income Available to Common Stockholders to Funds From Operations (FFO) \n\n(in thousands, except per share and unit data) \n\n(unaudited) \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Income Available to Common Stockholders \n\n$\n\n336,960 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,681,498 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n263,342 \n\nAdjustments:\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nNon-controlling interests in operating partnership\n\n&#160;\n\n7,914 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n39,100 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n9,500 \n\nReal estate related depreciation and amortization (1) \n\n&#160;\n\n1,547,865 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,463,512 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,341,836 \n\nDepreciation related to non-controlling interests\n\n&#8203; \n\n(22,110) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\nUnconsolidated JV real estate related depreciation and amortization\n\n&#8203; \n\n123,099 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n85,800 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n77,730 \n\nGain on real estate transactions\n\n&#8203; \n\n(177,332) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(1,445,229) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(316,895) \n\nImpairment of investments in real estate\n\n&#8203; \n\n3,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n18,291 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n6,482 \n\nFFO available to common stockholders and unitholders (2) \n\n$\n\n1,819,396 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,842,971 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,381,995 \n\nBasic FFO per share and unit\n\n$\n\n6.23 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n6.37 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n5.16 \n\nDiluted FFO per share and unit (2) \n\n$\n\n6.03 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n6.36 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n5.11 \n\nWeighted average common stock and units outstanding\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBasic\n\n&#160;\n\n292,123 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n289,165 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n268,073 \n\nDiluted (2) \n\n&#160;\n\n303,708 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n289,912 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n270,497 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(1) Real estate related depreciation and amortization was computed as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDepreciation and amortization per income statement \n\n$\n\n1,577,933 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,486,632 \n\n&#160;\n\n$\n\n1,366,379 \n\nNon-real estate depreciation \n\n&#8203; \n\n(30,068) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(23,120) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(24,543) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,547,865 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,463,512 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,341,836 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START (2) For all periods presented, we have excluded the effect of the series C, series J, series K and series L preferred stock, as applicable, that may be converted into common stock upon the occurrence of specified change in control transactions as described in the articles supplementary governing the series C, series J, series K and series L preferred stock, as applicable, as they would be anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWeighted average common stock and units outstanding\n\n&#160;\n\n292,123 \n\n&#160;\n\n289,165 \n\n&#160;\n\n268,073 \n\nAdd: Effect of dilutive securities\n\n&#160;\n\n11,585 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n2,424 \n\nWeighted average common stock and units outstanding&#8212;diluted\n\n&#160;\n\n303,708 \n\n&#160;\n\n289,912 \n\n&#160;\n\n270,497 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors.\n\nAnalysis of Debt between Fixed and Variable Rate\n\nWe use interest rate swap agreements and fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate movements. As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated debt was as follows (in millions):\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nEstimated Fair \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCarrying Value \n\n&#160; \n\nValue \n\nFixed rate debt\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n13,363.8 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n9,292.0 \n\nVariable rate debt subject to interest rate swaps\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n157.3 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n157.3 \n\nTotal fixed rate debt (including interest rate swaps)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n13,521.1 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n9,449.3 \n\nVariable rate debt\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,202.8 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n3,202.8 \n\nTotal outstanding debt\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n16,723.9 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n12,652.1 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nSensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\n\nThe following table shows the effects if assumed changes in interest rates occurred, based on fair values and interest expense as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nChange \n\nAssumed event \n\n&#8203; \n\n($ millions) \n\nIncrease in fair value of interest rate swaps following an assumed 10% increase in interest rates\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n(0.2) \n\nDecrease in fair value of interest rate swaps following an assumed 10% decrease in interest rates\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n0.2 \n\nIncrease in annual interest expense on our debt that is variable rate and not subject to swapped interest following a 10% increase in interest rates\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n11.9 \n\nDecrease in annual interest expense on our debt that is variable rate and not subject to swapped interest following a 10% decrease in interest rates\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(11.9) \n\nIncrease in fair value of fixed rate debt following a 10% decrease in interest rates\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n210.9 \n\nDecrease in fair value of fixed rate debt following a 10% increase in interest rates\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(201.0) \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nInterest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of a variety of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. Our primary currency exposures are to the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar and South African rand. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk related to the Brazilian real is limited to the impact that currency has on our share of the Ascenty entity&#8217;s operations and financial position. We attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuations by financing our investments in local currency denominations in order to reduce our exposure to any foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from transactions entered into in currencies other than the functional currencies of the associated entities. In addition, we may also hedge well-defined transactional exposures with foreign currency forwards or options, although there can be no assurances that these will be effective. As a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollar may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders&#8217; equity. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n"

Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#8217;s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013) . We acquired a majority interest in Teraco during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have excluded from our overall assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, internal control over financial reporting associated with Teraco and its total assets of $4.1 billion and total revenues of $71.4 million. Based on our assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 83.\n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThe management of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. (the Operating Partnership) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f).

We acquired a majority interest in Teraco during the year ended December 31, 2022.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nEvaluation of lease revenue \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records rental revenue on a straight-line basis if the Company determines on a lease-by lease basis it is probable substantially all lease payments over the term of the lease will be collected. Whenever the results of that assessment indicate that it is not probable that the Company will be able to collect substantially all lease payments over the remaining term of the lease, the Company records a reduction to rental revenue equal to the then-current combined balance of the deferred rent and amounts contractually due but unpaid for the lease (rent receivable), and ceases recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis and commences recognizing rental revenue on a cash collected basis. Rental and other services revenue was $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and deferred rent and rent receivable, net was $601.6 million and $560.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the probability of collection of lease payments as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company&#8217;s probability assessment of collection of substantially all the lease payments for its leases required significant auditor judgement because of the subjective nature of the evidence obtained. Specifically, evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer and any guarantors required significant auditor judgement.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company&#8217;s probability assessment of lease payment collection process, including controls related to the assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer and any guarantors. For a selection of the Company&#8217;s leases, we evaluated the Company&#8217;s determination of the collectability of substantially all of the lease payments by: (i) comparing the legal name of customer and any guarantor to the underlying lease agreements and third-party credit rating report, (ii) evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer by assessing their credit rating, (iii) reading publicly available information, including the customer&#8217;s financial statements, recent public filings, and news articles, and (iv) inquiring of Company employees to obtain evidence regarding creditworthiness of the customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START . \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2004\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDallas, Texas \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc.:\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated income statements, and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III, properties and accumulated depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company acquired TDE Investments Pty Ltd. during 2022, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, TDE Investments Pty Ltd.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $4,100,000,000 and total revenues of $71,400,000 included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of TDE Investments Pty Ltd.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion..\n\n&#8203; \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n&#8203; \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nDallas, Texas\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Partners of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and the Board of Directors of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Digital Realty Trust, L.P.:\n\n&#8203; \n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Operating Partnership) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated income statements, and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III, properties and accumulated depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n&#8203; \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Operating Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Operating Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEvaluation of lease revenue \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Operating Partnership records rental revenue on a straight-line basis if the Operating Partnership determines on a lease-by-lease basis it is probable substantially all lease payments over the term of the lease will be collected. Whenever the results of that assessment indicate that it is not probable that the Operating Partnership will be able to collect substantially all lease payments over the remaining term of the lease, the Operating Partnership records a reduction to rental revenue equal to the then-current combined balance of the deferred rent and amounts contractually due but unpaid for the lease (rent receivable), and ceases recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis and commences recognizing rental revenue on a cash consolidated basis. Rental and other services revenue was $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and deferred rent and rent receivable, net was $601.6 million and $560.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe identified the evaluation of the probability of collection of lease payments as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Operating Partnership&#8217;s probability assessment of collection of substantially all the lease payments for its leases required significant auditor judgment because of the subjective nature of the evidence obtained. Specifically, evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer and any guarantors required significant auditor judgment. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Operating Partnership&#8217;s probability assessment of lease payment collection process, including controls related to the assessment of the creditworthiness of the customer and any guarantors. For a selection of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s leases, we evaluated the Operating Partnership&#8217;s determination of the collectibility of substantially all of the lease payments by: (i) comparing the legal name of customer and any guarantor to the underlying lease agreements and third-party credit rating report, (ii) evaluating the creditworthiness of the customer by assessing their credit rating, (iii) reading publicly available information, including the customer&#8217;s financial statements, recent public filings, and news articles, and (iv) inquiring of Operating Partnership employees to obtain evidence regarding creditworthiness of the customers.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe have served as the Operating Partnership&#8217;s auditor since 2004.\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDallas, Texas\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

The Parent generally does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the OP, issuing public securities from time to time and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the OP and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Parent has not issued any debt but guarantees the unsecured debt of the OP and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\nThe OP holds substantially all the assets of the Company. The OP conducts the operations of the business and has no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent, which are generally contributed to the OP in exchange for partnership units, the OP generally generates the capital required by the Company&#8217;s business primarily through the OP&#8217;s operations, by the OP&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units.\n\nAccounting Principles and Basis of Presentation. The accompanying consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") and are presented in our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. All of the accounts of the Parent, the OP, and the subsidiaries of the OP are included in the accompanying financial statements. All material intercompany transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated. \n\n&#8203; \n\nManagement Estimates and Assumptions . U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period, reported amounts for assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable and appropriate, as discussed in the applicable sections throughout the consolidated financial statements, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported results. Actual results and outcomes may differ from our assumptions. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolidation . We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned as well as all partially-owned entities that we control. In addition, we consolidate any variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) for which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate whether or not an entity is a VIE (and we are the primary beneficiary) through consideration of substantive terms in the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses/receive benefits from the entity. \n\nFor entities that do not meet the definition of VIEs, we first consider if we are the general partner or a limited partner (or the equivalent in investments not structured as partnerships). We consolidate entities in which we are the general partner and the limited partners do not have rights that would preclude control. For entities in which we are the general partner, but the limited partners hold substantive participating or kick-out rights that prohibit our ability to control the entity, we apply the equity method of accounting since, as the general partner, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the entities. For entities in which we are a limited partner, or that are not structured similar to a partnership, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners. When factors indicate we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, we consolidate the entity.\n\nForeign Operations and Foreign Currencies. The functional currency of each of our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in other countries is the principal currency in which each entity&#8217;s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated, which may be different from the local currency of incorporation or the currency with which the entities conduct their operations. The primary functional currencies impacting our business include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar, South African rand and Brazilian real. \n\nFor our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate financial statements into U.S. dollars at the time we consolidate these subsidiaries&#8217; financial statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Certain balance sheet items, such as equity and capital-related accounts are reflected at historical exchange rates. Income statement accounts are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the reporting periods. \n\nWe and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third-party debt that is not denominated in the functional currency of the entities. When debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, a gain or loss can result. The associated adjustment is reflected in other (expenses) income, net, in the consolidated income statements, unless it is intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature or third-party debt that has been designated as a nonderivative net investment hedge &#8211; in which case the associated adjustments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income. In the statement of cash flows, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the time of the respective cash flows or at average exchange rates for the period, depending on the nature of the cash flow items.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nAcquisition Accounting . We evaluate whether or not substantially all of the value of acquired assets is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For asset acquisitions: (1) transaction costs are included in the total costs of the acquisition and are allocated on a pro-rata basis to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities acquired, (2) real estate assets acquired are measured based on their cost or total consideration exchanged with any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount allocated to real estate properties and their associated intangibles such as above and below-market leases, in-place leases, acquired ground leases, and customer relationship value and (3) all other assets and liabilities assumed, including any debt, are recorded at fair value. For business combinations: (1) transaction costs are expensed as incurred, (2) all acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets are recognized at fair value, (3) the amount of any purchase consideration that exceeds the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recognized as goodwill, and (4) to the extent the purchase consideration is less than the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, a gain on bargain purchase is recognized. \n\nWhen we obtain control of an unconsolidated entity that we previously held as an equity method investment and the acquisition qualifies as a business combination, we remeasure our previously held interest in the unconsolidated entity at its acquisition-date fair value, derecognize the book value associated with that interest, and recognize any resulting gain or loss in earnings. \n\nWe allocate purchase price primarily using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs (further defined in Fair Value Measurements) as follows:\n\nReal Estate . The fair value of acquired land is determined based on relevant market data, such as comparable land sales. The fair value of acquired improvements is determined based on replacement cost as adjusted for any physical and/or market obsolescence. Operating properties are valued as if they are vacant (&#8220;as-if-vacant&#8221;) by applying an income approach methodology using either a discounted cash flow analysis or by applying a capitalization rate to the estimated Net Operating Income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) of a property. As-if-vacant values consider estimated carrying costs during expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases (based on current market conditions). Carrying costs during expected lease up periods include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses as well as estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods. Costs to execute similar leases include lease commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs.\n\nLease Intangibles. The portion of the purchase price related to acquired in-place leases is recorded as intangible assets and liabilities as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Above and below market leases: We use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the estimated present value of any difference between contractual rents for acquired in-place leases as compared to current market rents. If rents on acquired in-place leases are higher than current market rents, we record an intangible asset for the favorable rents. If rents on acquired in-place leases are lower than current market rents, we record a liability for the unfavorable rents. Favorable rent assets are amortized as a reduction to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. Unfavorable rent liabilities are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial lease term plus any below-market fixed rate renewal periods. ##TABLE_END \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; In-place lease value: Since the as-if-vacant model is used to determine the value of acquired operating properties, the value of such properties does not include the value associated with having existing tenants who are leasing space in the purchased properties. Having in-place tenants allows buyers to avoid costs associated with leasing the property as well as any rent losses and unreimbursed operating expenses during the lease-up period. An asset for such benefits is recorded separately as in-place lease value. In-place lease value is determined based on estimated carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods as well as costs to execute similar leases. We determine expected carrying costs and costs to execute similar leases in the same manner as described in the previous discussion of the valuation of operating properties using the as-if-vacant model. The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Customer relationship value: In some transactions, customers acquired are expected to generate recurring revenues beyond existing in-place lease terms. We utilize the multi-period excess earnings method to determine value customer relationship value, if any. Key factors reflected in this approach include: (1) projected revenue growth from existing customers, (2) historical customer lease renewals and attrition rates, (3) rental renewal probabilities and related market terms, (4) estimated operating costs, and (5) discount rate. Customer relationship value is amortized to expense ratably over the anticipated life of substantially all of the acquired customer relationships that are expected to generate excess earnings. ##TABLE_END \n\nDebt. We recognize the fair value of any acquired debt based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and market interest rates that would be available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. If acquired debt is publicly-traded, we utilize available market data to determine fair value of the debt. Any discount or premium on the principal is included in the carrying value of the debt and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method. \n\nNoncontrolling interests. The fair value of the ownership percentage of acquired entities held by third parties is determined based on the fair value of the consolidated net assets acquired &#8211; adjusted for any put or call options or other such features associated of the noncontrolling interests. \n\nOther acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of other acquired assets and liabilities is determined using the best information available. For working capital items that are short-term in nature, fair value is generally presumed to equal the seller&#8217;s carrying value, unless facts and circumstances suggest otherwise.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nFair Value Measurements. Fair value is intended to reflect the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methods we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Given the significant amount of judgement and subjectivity involved in the determination of fair value, estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of amounts that would be realized on disposition. There are three levels in the fair value hierarchy under US GAAP, which are: \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 1 &#8211; Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity can access at the measurement date. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 2 &#8211; Inputs that are directly or indirectly observable for the associated asset or liability, but which do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Level 3 &#8211; Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. ##TABLE_END \n\nIn instances where inputs from multiple different levels of the fair value hierarchy are used to determine fair value, the lowest level input that is significant is used to determine the fair-value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair-value measurement requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. We utilize fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the fair value of: marketable equity securities, share-based compensation awards, derivative instruments, and outstanding debt. Such measurements are also regularly utilized in assessing whether or not impairments may exist on intangible assets (including goodwill). In addition, we utilize fair value measurements on a non-recurring basis to determine the fair value associated with assets held for sale, acquisitions of assets, and acquisitions of businesses. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities. Investments in unconsolidated entities as reflected on the consolidated balance sheets includes all investments accounted for using the equity method. We use the equity method to account for these investments, because we have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operating and financial policies, but do not control them. Equity method investments are initially recognized at our cost. Transaction costs related to the formation of equity method investments are also capitalized. We subsequently adjust these balances to reflect: (1) our proportionate share of net earnings/losses of the entities and accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, (2) distributions received, (3) contributions made, (4) sales and redemptions of our investments, and (5) certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity method investment, we evaluate whether or not the loss in value is other than temporary. If we determine that a loss in value is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value. \n\nWith regard to the cash flow classifications of distributions from unconsolidated entities, we have elected the nature of the distribution approach as the information is available to us to determine the nature of the underlying activity that generated the distributions. In accordance with this approach, cash flows generated from the operations of an unconsolidated entity are classified as a return on investment (cash inflow from operating activities) and cash flows that are generated from property sales, debt refinancing or sales and redemptions of our investments are classified as a return of investment (cash inflow from investing activities). \n\nThe Company has a negligible value of investments accounted for under the cost-method. These investments are included in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash. We consider all cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions, and short-term highly-liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We invest our cash with high-credit quality institutions. We may invest our cash balances in money market accounts that are not insured. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents, and have not realized any losses associated with cash investments or accounts.\n\nRestricted Cash . Cash that is held for a specific purpose and thus not available to us for immediate or general business use is categorized separately from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Restricted cash primarily consists of contractual capital expenditures and other deposits.\n\nAssets Held for Sale. We classify an asset as held for sale when the following criteria are met: 1). management that has the proper authority has approved and committed to a plan to sell, 2). the asset is available for immediate sale, 3). an active program to locate a buyer has commenced, 4). the sale of the asset is probable, and 5). transfer of the asset is expected to occur within one year. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. \n\nInvestments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assts. Depreciable lives of assets are stated below. \n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\nInvestments in Real Estate.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nCapitalization of Costs. \n\nDevelopment costs &#8211; During the land development and construction periods of qualifying projects, we capitalize direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties. Capitalized project costs include all costs associated with the development of a property. Such costs include the cost of: land and buildings, improvements and fixed equipment, design and engineering, other construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, legal fees, personnel working on the project, and corporate supervision. Capitalization of costs ceases when development projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use. We generally consider development projects to be substantially complete and ready for intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy.\n\nLeasing commissions &#8211; Leasing commissions and other direct costs associated with the acquisition of tenants are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized deferred leasing costs of approximately $ 51.8 million, $ 42.8 million and $ 40.8 million, respectively. Deferred leasing costs are included in customer relationship value, deferred leasing costs and intangibles on the consolidated balance sheet and amounted to approximately $ 257.0 million and $ 249.3 million, net of accumulated amortization of $ 514.3 million and $ 453.0 million, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense on leasing costs was approximately $ 79.2 million, $ 83.4 million, and $ 76.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n&#8203; \n\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets. We assess the carrying value of our properties whenever events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable (&#8220;triggering events\"). Triggering events typically relate to a change in the expected holding period of a property, an adverse change in expected future cash flows of the property, or a trend of past cash flow losses that is expected to continue in the future. If our assessment of triggering events indicates the carrying value of a property or asset group might not be recoverable, we estimate the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and compare that amount to the book value of the assets. If our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates we are unable to recover the carrying value of a property or asset group, we record an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the property or asset group exceeds fair value. \n\nWe generally estimate fair value of rental properties using a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses, and capital improvements that a market participant would use. In certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value. When determining undiscounted future cash flows, we consider factors such as future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.\n\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has one reportable segment and one reporting unit. We evaluate goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. In addition to monitoring for impactful events and circumstances, we perform an annual one-step quantitative test in which we compare the reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value to its fair value. We determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of the Company&#8217;s publicly-traded shares. To the extent the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we would record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have not recognized any goodwill impairments since our inception. Since a significant aspect of our goodwill is denominated in foreign currencies, changes to our goodwill balance can occur over time due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nOther acquired intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationship value and in-place lease value. All of our other acquired intangible assets have finite useful lives. If impairment indicators arise with respect to these finite-lived intangible assets, we evaluate for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill.\n\nShare-Based Compensation. The Company provides a variety of share-based compensation awards to employees and directors, including awards that contain: time-based vesting criteria and a combination of time-based and performance based criteria. The Company measures all share-based compensation awards at grant date fair value. The fair value of awards that include only a time-based service condition (&#8220;time-based awards&#8221;) is the closing price of the Company&#8217;s publicly-traded shares at the grant date &#8211; and is expensed over the requisite service period. The fair value of awards that include a combination of market performance based criteria and time-based vesting is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation method. The fair value of these awards is expensed over the requisite service period &#8211; and is not adjusted based on actual achievement of the market performance condition.\n\nDerivative Instruments. As part of the Company&#8217;s risk management program, a variety of financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, may be used to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency exposures. The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage risks, and not for trading or speculative purposes. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. The majority of inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs (such as estimates of current credit spreads). Based on the insignificance of credit valuation adjustments to the overall valuation of our derivatives, we have determined that valuation of our outstanding derivatives is properly categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative financial instrument is undesignated or qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it represents a fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedge. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are included in the assessment of effectiveness, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur. In the event it becomes probable the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates will not occur, the derivative would be terminated and the amount in other comprehensive income (loss) would be recognized in earnings. \n\n&#8203; \n\nGains and losses representing components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow and fair value hedges are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis in the same caption as the hedged item over the term of the hedge. Gains and losses representing components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for net investment hedges are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest Rate Swaps &#8211; The Company uses interest rate swaps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements related to certain floating rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. We record all interest rate swaps on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). Variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on expected future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect nonperformance risk for the Company and for the respective counterparties. The counterparties of interest rate swaps are generally larger financial institutions engaged in providing a variety of financial services. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest rate derivatives are presented on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets &#8211; with interest rate swap assets presented in other assets, and interest rate swap liabilities presented in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, there was no impact from netting arrangements, because the Company had no derivatives in liability positions. Net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.\n\nForeign Currency Contracts &#8211; The Company may, from time to time, enter into forward contracts pursuant to which we agree to sell an amount of one currency in exchange for an agreed-upon amount of another currency. These agreements are typically entered into to manage exposures related to transactions that are settled in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity that is party to the transactions. To the extent the Company does not designate such instruments as hedges, changes in the fair value of these instruments are reflected in earnings. The Company had no outstanding derivative foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2022.\n\nHedge of Net Investment in Foreign Operations &#8211; The Company has no outstanding derivatives that function as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. However, notes denominated in the Swiss franc with a total outstanding principle balance of 545 million Swiss francs (&#8220;CHF&#8221;) issued by Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. (&#8220;DIH&#8221;, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the OP with Euro functional currency) are designated as non-derivative hedges of DIH&#8217;s net investment in certain of its subsidiaries that have CHF as the functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these hedges, to the extent they are included in the assessment of effectiveness, are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be deferred until disposal of the underlying assets (which is currently not expected to occur). Any amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are reflected as foreign-currency transaction gains/losses which are included as Other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements.\n\nCross-Currency Interest Rate Swaps &#8211; The Company's cross-currency interest rate swap agreements synthetically swap U.S. dollar-denominated fixed rate debt for foreign currency-denominated fixed rate debt and are designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The gain or loss on the net investment hedge derivative instruments is included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income until the net investment is sold, diluted, or liquidated. Interest payments received from the cross-currency swaps are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated income statements.\n\nSee Note 17. &#8220;Derivative Instruments&#8221; for further discussion on the Company&#8217;s outstanding derivative instruments. \n\nIncome Taxes. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (a &#8220;REIT&#8221;) for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. generally is not required to pay U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent taxable income is currently distributed to its stockholders. If Digital Realty Trust, Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income. \n\nThe Company is subject to foreign, state and local income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. The Company&#8217;s taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state, local and foreign income taxes to the extent there is taxable income. Accordingly, the Company recognizes current and deferred income taxes for the Company and its taxable REIT subsidiaries, including for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

If a tax position is not considered &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; to be sustained solely on its technical merits, no benefits of the tax position are to be recognized (for financial statement purposes). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have no assets or liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We classify interest and penalties from significant uncertain tax positions as interest expense and operating expense, respectively, in our consolidated income statements. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had no such interest or penalties. We are open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions for the tax years that are within the statute of limitations for those jurisdictions.\n\nSee Note 13. &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; for further discussion on income taxes.\n\nTransactional-based Taxes. We account for transactional-based taxes, such as value added tax, or VAT, for our international properties on a net basis.\n\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests. Noncontrolling interests represent the share of consolidated entities owned by third parties. We recognize each noncontrolling holder&#8217;s share of the fair value of the respective entity&#8217;s net assets as noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheets at the date of formation or acquisition. Noncontrolling interest balances are adjusted for the noncontrolling holder&#8217;s share of additional contributions, distributions, and net earnings or losses. \n\n&#8203; \n\nPartnership units which are contingently redeemable for cash are classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests and presented in the mezzanine section of the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets between total liabilities and stockholder&#8217;s equity. Redeemable noncontrolling interests include amounts related to partnership units issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in which redemption for equity is outside the control of the Company. \n\nThe amounts of consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented on the Company&#8217;s consolidated income statements as income (or loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nRevenue Recognition. \n\nRental And Other Services Revenue &#8211; We generate the majority of our revenue by leasing our properties to customers under operating lease agreements, which are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (&#8220;ASC 842&#8221;). We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term if we determine it is probable that substantially all of the lease payments will be collected over the lease term. We commence recognition of revenue from rentals at the date the property is ready for its intended use by the tenant and the tenant takes possession, or controls the physical use of the leased asset. The excess of rents recognized as revenue over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in deferred rent. Rental payments received in excess of revenue recognized are classified as accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. Unpaid rents that are contractually due are included in accounts and other receivables. \n\nWe estimate the probability of collection of lease payments based on customer creditworthiness, outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical bad debts &#8211; as well as current economic trends. If collection of substantially all lease payments over the lease term is not probable, rental revenue is recognized when payment is received, and we record a full valuation allowance on the balance of any rent receivable, less the balance of any security deposits or letters of credit. If collection is subsequently determined to be probable, we: 1). resume recognizing rental revenue on a straight-line basis, 2). record incremental revenue such that the cumulative amount recognized is equal to the amount that would have been recorded on a straight-line basis since inception of the lease, and 3). reverse the allowance for bad debt recorded on outstanding receivables. \n\nGenerally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, are recovered from our customers. We record amounts reimbursable by customers (&#8220;tenant recoveries&#8221;) as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred &#8211; which is generally on a ratable basis through the term of the lease. \n\n&#8203; \n\nWe account for and present rental revenue and tenant recoveries as a single component under rental and other services as the timing of recognition is the same, the pattern with which we transfer the right of use of the property and related services to the lessee are both on a straight-line basis and our leases qualify as operating leases.\n\n&#8203; \n\nInterconnection services include port and cross-connect services generally provided on a month-to-month, one-year or multi-year term. We bill for these services on a monthly basis and recognizes the revenue over the period the service is provided. Revenue for cross-connect installations is generally recognized in the period the cross-connect is installed. Interconnection services that are not specific to a particular leased space are accounted for under Topic 606 and have terms that are generally one year or less.\n\n&#8203; \n\nFee Income And Other &#8211; Fee income arises primarily from contractual management agreements with entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest. Management fees are recognized as earned under the respective agreements. The Company also provides property and construction management services. Depending on the nature of the agreements, revenue for these services is recognized either on a ratable monthly basis as the service is provided, or when certain performance milestones are met. Service revenues are typically recognized on an equal monthly basis based on the minimum fee to be earned. The monthly amounts could be adjusted depending on whether certain performance milestones are met.\n\nWe utilize the practical expedient in ASC 842 that allows us to account for lease and non-lease components associated with each lease as a single lease component recorded within rental and other services, instead of accounting for such items separately under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). We recognize revenue for items \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P.

Revenue recognized as a result of applying ASC 606 was less than 8 % of total rental and other services revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n&#8203; \n\nTransaction and Integration Expense. Transaction expenses include closing costs, broker commissions and other \n\nprofessional fees, including legal and accounting fees related to business combinations or acquisitions that were not consummated. Integration costs include transition costs associated with organizational restructuring (such as severance and retention payments and recruiting expenses), third-party consulting expenses directly related to the integration of acquired companies (in areas such as cost savings and synergy realization, technology and systems work), and internal costs such as training, travel and labor, reflecting time spent by Company personnel on integration activities and projects. Recurring costs are recorded in general and administrative expense. \n\n&#8203; \n\nGains on Disposition of Properties. We recognize gains on the disposition of real estate when the recognition criteria have been met, generally at the time the risks and rewards and title have transferred, and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. We recognize losses from the disposition of real estate when known. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements. \n\nReference Rate Reform . The Financial Conduct Authority and other independent groups announced in July 2017, that beginning in 2021, they would stop requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). As a result, in the U.S. the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR in debt and derivative financial instruments. Other global regulators have also undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates (&#8220;IBORs&#8221;). Both LIBOR and IBOR are herein referred to as &#8220;IBOR-indexed rate&#8221;. In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain USD LIBOR tenors to continue to be published until June 2023. This change would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the USD LIBOR market, without the need to transition these contracts to SOFR. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , that provided practical expedients to address existing guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting due to the expected market transition from an IBOR-indexed rate to alternative reference rates, such as SOFR for LIBOR (&#8220;reference rate reform&#8221;). \n\nThe first practical expedient within the ASU allows companies to elect to not apply certain modification accounting requirements to debt, derivative, and lease contracts affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The second practical expedient allows companies to change the reference rate and other critical terms related to the reference rate reform in derivative hedge documentation without having to designate the hedging relationship &#8211; allowing companies to continue applying hedge accounting to existing cash flow and net investment hedges. \n\nThe ASU was effective on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020 and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. We will continue to evaluate debt, derivative, and lease contracts that are modified in the future to ensure they are eligible for modification relief and apply the available practical expedients as needed. Also, in December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (&#8220;ASU 2022-06&#8221;), which was issued to defer the sunset date of Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. ASU 2022-06 is effective immediately for all companies. ASU 2022-06 had no impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,\" which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. ASU 2021-08 is applicable on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022 (or in January 1, 2023 for the Company). Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\n\nWe determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements that have yet to be adopted by the Company will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not apply to our operations.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

Business Combinations\n\nOn August 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of a 61.1 % indirect controlling interest in Teraco, a leading carrier-neutral data center and interconnection services provider in South Africa (the &#8220;Teraco Acquisition&#8221;). The total purchase price was $ 1.7 billion cash, funded by our global revolving credit facility and partial settlement of our forward equity sale agreements described under Note 14. &#8220;Equity and Capital&#8212;Forward Equity Sale.&#8221; Teraco controls (and consolidates) the Teraco Connect Trust (&#8220;the Trust&#8221;) that was created as part of the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Program in South Africa. The Trust owns a 12 % interest in Teraco&#8217;s primary operating company, however, because Teraco (and the Company) controls the Trust, the Trust is consolidated by Teraco (and the Company). If the Trust was not consolidated by Teraco, the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in Teraco would have been approximately 55 %.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recorded at the acquisition date (in thousands):\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nFinal Amounts \n\nBuilding and improvements\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,376,128 \n\nConstruction in progress and space held for development\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n521,153 \n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n2,784 \n\nAssumed cash and cash equivalents\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n5,528 \n\nGoodwill\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,625,994 \n\nCustomer relationship value and other intangibles (weighted-average amortization life of 14 years )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n720,126 \n\nDebt assumed\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n( 355,688 )\n\nOperating lease liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 4,031 )\n\nDeferred tax liabilities, net\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n( 632,841 )\n\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n( 1,530,090 )\n\nWorking capital assets, net\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1,112 \n\nTotal purchase consideration\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n1,730,175 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nGoodwill &#8212; The purchase price of the Teraco Acquisition exceeded the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by $ 1.6 billion. This amount was recorded as goodwill. We believe the strategic benefits of the acquisition support the value of goodwill recorded. Specifically, Teraco has numerous cross-connects, cloud on-ramps and data centers in addition to direct access to multiple subsea cables. The acquisition of Teraco adds South Africa to the Company&#8217;s three existing markets on the continent, including Kenya, Mozambique, and Nigeria. The strategic importance of these markets has been enhanced by the recent and ongoing implementation of new subsea cable networks encircling Africa. When combined with the Company&#8217;s highly connected facilities in Marseille, France, and across EMEA, our customers will now have a range of strategic connectivity hubs from which to serve all corners of the African market.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Teraco acquisition was not material and neither the investment in the assets nor the results of operations of the acquisition was significant to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations, and thus pro forma information is not required to be presented.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

The interest retained by these owners is hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Remaining Teraco Interest&#8221; and the owners of such interest are hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Rollover Shareholders&#8221;. Pursuant to the Put/Call Agreement, the Rollover Shareholders have the right to sell all or a portion of the Remaining Teraco Interest to the Company for a two-year period beginning on February 1, 2026, and the Company has the right to purchase all or a portion of the Remaining Teraco Interest from the Rollover Shareholders for a one-year period beginning on February 1, 2028. Per the terms of the agreement, the purchase price of the Remaining Teraco Interest for the put right and the call right can be settled by the Company with cash, shares in the Company, or a combination of cash and shares. In the event the Company elects to settle a put or call in whole or in part with shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock, such shares will be issued in a private placement transaction with customary accompanying registration rights.\n\n&#8203; \n\nSince the Rollover Shareholders can redeem the put right at their discretion and such redemption, which could be in cash, is outside the Company&#8217;s control, the Company recorded the noncontrolling interest as Redeemable NCI and classified it in temporary equity within its consolidated balance sheets. The Redeemable NCI was initially recorded at its acquisition-date fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period for income (or loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest (a $ 4.8 million net loss for the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022). If the contractual redemption value of the Redeemable NCI is greater than its carrying value, an adjustment is made to reflect Redeemable NCI at the higher of its contractual redemption value or its carrying value each reporting period. Changes to the redemption value are recognized immediately in the period the change occurs. If the redemption value of the Redeemable NCI is equal to or less than the fair market value of the Remaining Teraco Interest, the change in the redemption value will be adjusted through Additional Paid in Capital. If the redemption value is greater than the fair market value of the Remaining Teraco Interest, the change in redemption value will be adjusted through Retained Earnings. These adjustments are not reflected on the Company&#8217;s income statement, but are instead reflected as adjustments to the net income component of the Company&#8217;s earnings per share calculations. When calculating earnings per share attributable to Digital Realty Trust, Inc., the Company adjusts net income attributable to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to the extent the redemption value exceeds the fair value of the Redeemable NCI on a cumulative basis. For the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, no such adjustment was required.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

As of December 31, 2022, the termination dates of these ground leases ranged from 2027 to 2108. In addition, our corporate headquarters along with several regional office locations are subject to leases with termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2033.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe leases generally require us to make fixed rental payments that increase at defined intervals during the term of the lease plus pay our share of common area, real estate and utility expenses as incurred. The leases do not contain residual value guarantees and do not impose material restrictions or covenants on us. Further, the leases have been classified and accounted for as either operating or finance leases. Rent expense related to operating leases included in rental property operating and maintenance expense in the consolidated income statements amounted to approximately $ 144.0 million, $ 145.7 million and $ 120.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term for our operating leases and finance leases was 12 years and 16 years , respectively.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate was 3.0 % for operating leases and 1.8 % for finance leases at December 31, 2022.

Hereafter, Digital Core REIT and its associated subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Singapore REIT (&#8220;SREIT&#8221;). In connection with the listing, the Company contributed a portfolio of 10 operating data center properties to the SREIT. The fair value of these properties was determined to be approximately $ 1.4 billion based on two separate third party appraisal reports. In exchange for the contribution of these properties, the Company received: 1). $ 919 million cash and 2). a 39.4 % equity interest in the publicly-traded Digital Core REIT entity, while retaining a 10 % direct interest in the operating properties that were contributed by the Company to the SREIT. In addition, the Company received approximately $ 13 million of acquisition fees paid to the Company by Digital Core REIT in the form of additional units in Digital Core REIT. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company determined the fair market value of its 10 % retained investment in the properties contributed to the SREIT based on its retained ownership percentage applied to the appraised value of the properties. This approach was deemed appropriate because the Company determined that a discount for lack of marketability and/or lack of control associated with its 10 % direct interest in the properties was not warranted.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

Digital Core REIT owns 11 operating data center properties. The Company&#8217;s ownership interest in the units of DCRU, as well as its ownership interest in certain operating properties of DCRU are collectively referred to as the Company&#8217;s investment in DCREIT.\n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company held a 35 % interest in the DCRU and separately owns a 10 % direct retained interest in the underlying North American operating properties and a 75 % direct retained interest in the underlying German operating property. The Company&#8217;s 35 % interest in DCRU consists of 396 million units and 390 million units as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Based on the closing price per unit of $ 0.55 and $ 1.16 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the units the Company owns in DCRU was approximately $ 218 million and $ 453 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThese values do not include the value of the Company&#8217;s 10 % interest in the North American operating properties and 75 % interest in the German operating property of DCRU, because the associated ownership interests are not publicly traded. The Company accounts for its investment in DCREIT as an equity method investment (and not at fair value) based on the significant influence it is able to exert on DCREIT. The Company determined that the decline in fair value of the investment in DCRU as compared to the Company&#8217;s book basis as of December 31, 2022 was temporary in nature.\n\n&#8203; \n\nPursuant to contractual agreements with DCRU and its operating properties, the Company will earn fees for asset and property management services as well as fees for aiding in future acquisition, disposition and development activities. Certain of these fees are payable to the Company in the form of additional units in DCRU or in cash. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company earned fees pursuant to these contractual agreements of approximately $ 10.6 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, which is recorded as fee income and other on the consolidated income statement.\n\nAscenty &#8211; The Company&#8217;s ownership percentage in Ascenty includes an approximate 2 % interest held by one of the Company&#8217;s non-controlling interest holders. This 2 % interest had a carrying value of approximately $ 18.0 million and $ 20.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Ascenty is a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss related to this VIE is limited to our equity investment in the entity.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

The global revolving credit facility can be drawn in Australian dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Singapore dollars, Indonesian rupiah, Swiss francs, Korean won and U.S. dollars (with the ability to add other currencies in the future).\n\nOn April 5, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to the Second Amended and Restated Global Senior Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Amendment provided for, among other things: (1) an increase in the size of the global revolving credit facility from $ 3.0 billion to $ 3.75 billion and (2) the transition from U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for floating rate borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars for all purposes under the Credit Agreement.\n\nWe have the ability to increase the size of the global revolving credit facility by up to $ 750 million, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. Other key terms of the global revolving credit facility are as follows:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Maturity date: January 24, 2026, with two six-month extension options available. The bank group is obligated to grant the extension options provided we give proper notice, we make certain representations and warranties and no default exists under the global revolving credit facilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Interest rate: the applicable index plus a margin which is based on the credit ratings of our long-term debt and is currently 85 basis points. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Annual facility fee: based on the total commitment amount of the facility and the credit ratings of our long-term debt is currently 20 basis points and is payable quarterly. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Sustainability-linked pricing component: pricing can increase by up to 5 basis points or decrease by up to 5 basis points depending on whether or not the OP or its subsidiaries meet certain sustainability performance targets. ##TABLE_END \n\nYen Revolving Credit Facility \n\nIn addition to the global revolving credit facility, we have a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings in Japanese Yen of up to &#165; 33.3 billion (approximately $ 253.9 million based on the exchange rate on December 31, 2022), hereafter referred to as the &#8220;Yen revolving credit facility&#8221;). We have the ability from time to time to increase the size of the Yen revolving credit facility to up to &#165; 93.3 billion (approximately $ 711.5 million based on the exchange rate on December 31, 2022), subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent.

In addition, we are required to maintain financial coverage ratios, including with ratios respect to unencumbered assets. After the occurrence of and during the continuance of any event of default, these credit facilities restrict the Parent&#8217;s ability to make distributions to stockholders or redeem or otherwise repurchase shares of its capital stock, except in limited circumstances (such as those necessary to enable Digital Realty Trust, Inc. to maintain its qualification as a REIT and to minimize the payment of income or excise tax). As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of such covenants for both of these revolving credit facilities. \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

The covenants also require us to maintain total unencumbered assets of not less than 150 % of the aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants.\n\nEarly Extinguishment of Unsecured Senior Notes \n\nWe recognized the following losses on early extinguishment of unsecured notes:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; During the year ended December 31, 2022 : $ 51.1 million primarily due to redemption of the 4.750 % Notes due 2025 in February 2022. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; During the year ended December 31, 2021: $ 18.3 million primarily due to redemption of the 2.750 % Notes due 2023 in February 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; During the year ended December 31, 2020: $ 103.2 million primarily due to redemption of: ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START o 3.950 % Notes due 2022 and 3.625 % Notes due 2022 in August 2020; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START o 4.750 % Notes due 2023 in October 2020 ##TABLE_END \n\n&#8203; \n\nEuro Term Loan Agreement \n\nOn August 11, 2022, Digital Dutch Finco B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, entered into a term loan agreement (the &#8220;Euro Term Loan Agreement&#8221;) which governs (i) a &#8364; 375.0 million three-year senior unsecured term loan facility (the &#8220;2025 Term Facility&#8221;), the entire amount of which was funded on the closing date, and (ii) a &#8364; 375.0 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility (the &#8220;2025-27 Term Facility&#8221; and, together with the 2025 Term Facility, the &#8220;Euro Term Facilities&#8221;), comprised of &#8364; 125.0 million of initial term loans, the entire amount of which was funded on the closing date, and &#8364; 250.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments that were not funded on the closing date, and were funded on September 9, 2022. The Euro Term Facilities provide for borrowings in Euros. The 2025 Term Facility matures on August 11, 2025. The 2025-27 Term Facility matures on August 11, 2025, subject to two maturity extension options of one year each. The interest rate for borrowings under the Euro Term Facilities is based on EURIBO, plus a margin based on the corporate credit rating of our long-term senior unsecured debt of between 0.80 % and 1.60 % per annum. As of the closing date, the applicable rate for borrowings is EURIBO plus 0.95 % per annum. We are also required to pay certain fees to the administrative agent under the Euro Term Facilities. The Euro Term Facilities may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Euro Term Facilities and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

Income Taxes\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. has elected to be treated and believes that it has been organized and has operated in a manner that has enabled it to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. is generally not subject to corporate level federal income taxes on taxable income distributed currently to its stockholders. Since inception, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. has distributed at least 100 % of its taxable income annually. As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the Company&#8217;s accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe Operating Partnership is a partnership and is not required to pay federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to its partners, who include such amounts on their federal income tax returns. As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the Operating Partnership&#8217;s accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have elected taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. Income taxes for TRS entities were accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- (Continued) \n\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\nFor our TRS entities and foreign subsidiaries that are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset may not be realized, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from the change in circumstances that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in the income statement. Deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowance) and liabilities for our TRS entities and foreign subsidiaries were accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of approximately $ 1,184.6 million and $ 658.8 million, respectively, primarily related to our foreign properties, classified in accounts payable and other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. The majority of our net deferred tax liability relates to differences between foreign tax basis and book basis of the assets acquired in the Teraco Acquisition in August 2022, Interxion Combination in March 2020, the European Portfolio Acquisition in July 2016 and the Sentrum portfolio acquisition in 2012. The valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards that we do not expect to utilize attributable to certain foreign jurisdictions.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross deferred income tax assets:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n175,935 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n155,152 \n\nBasis difference - real estate property\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n14,027 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n9,078 \n\nBasis difference - intangibles\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n7,682 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,357 \n\nBasis difference - equity investments\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n5,694 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\nStraight-line rent\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n8,097 \n\nOther - temporary differences\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n132,578 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n175,766 \n\nTotal gross deferred income tax assets\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n335,916 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n350,450 \n\nValuation allowance\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 125,491 )\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n( 130,893 )\n\nTotal deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n210,425 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n219,557 \n\nGross deferred income tax liabilities:\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nBasis difference - real estate property\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,160,412 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n798,640 \n\nBasis difference - equity investments\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n3,543 \n\nBasis difference - intangibles\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n219,653 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n63,222 \n\nStraight-line rent\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n9,215 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n10,942 \n\nOther - temporary differences\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,744 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,976 \n\nTotal gross deferred income tax liabilities\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,395,024 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n878,323 \n\nNet deferred income tax liabilities (1) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n1,184,599 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n658,766 \n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Net of deferred tax assets of $ 8.2 million and $ 7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

Equity and Capital \n\nEquity Distribution Agreement\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. are parties to an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering sales agreement dated April 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Sales Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. can issue and sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $ 1.5 billion through various named agents from time to time. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had no sales under the Sales Agreement and $ 1.5 billion is still available.\n\nForward Equity Sale\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Parent completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of its common stock, all of which were offered in connection with forward sale agreements it entered into with certain financial institutions acting as forward purchasers. The forward purchasers borrowed and sold an aggregate of 6,250,000 shares of the Parent&#8217;s common stock in the public offering. The Parent did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the forward purchasers in the public offering. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we settled the forward sale agreements in full by issuing approximately 6.3 million shares, resulting in proceeds of approximately $ 939.0 million. Upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements, the OP issued general partner common partnership units to the Parent in exchange for contribution of the net proceeds. We accounted for our forward equity sales agreements in accordance with the accounting guidance governing financial instruments and derivatives.\n\nRedeemable Preferred Stock\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Company has issued and outstanding the following series of cumulative redeemable preferred stock, which are governed by the articles supplementary for the applicable series of preferred stock as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8203; \n\nLiquidation \n\n&#8203; \n\nAnnual \n\n&#8203; \n\nShares Outstanding as of \n\n&#8203; \n\nBalance (in thousands, net of \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nDate(s) \n\n&#8203; \n\nInitial Date to \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nValue (in \n\n&#8203; \n\nDividend \n\n&#8203; \n\nDecember 31, \n\n&#8203; \n\nissuance costs) as of December 31, \n\nPreferred Stock (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nIssued \n\n&#160; \n\nRedeem (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nShare Cap (3) \n\n&#160; \n\nthousands) (4) \n\n&#160; \n\nRate (5) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n5.250 % Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock \n\n&#8203; \n\nAug 7, 2017 \n\n&#8203; \n\nAug 7, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n0.4252100 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n200,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n1.31250 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,000,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n8,000,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n193,540 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n193,540 \n\n5.850 % Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock \n\n&#8203; \n\nMar 13, 2019 \n\n&#8203; \n\nMar 13, 2024 \n\n&#8203; \n\n0.4361100 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n210,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1.46250 \n\n&#8203; \n\n8,400,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n8,400,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n203,264 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n203,264 \n\n5.200 % Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock \n\n&#8203; \n\nOct 10, 2019 \n\n&#8203; \n\nOct 10, 2024 \n\n&#8203; \n\n0.3851800 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n345,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n1.30000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n13,800,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n13,800,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n334,886 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n334,886 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n755,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n30,200,000 \n\n&#160; \n\n30,200,000 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n731,690 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$ \n\n731,690 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) All series of preferred stock do not have a stated maturity date and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions.

However, if such parity is reached, vested LTIP Units may be converted into an equal number of common units of the Operating Partnership at any time. The awards generally vest over periods between two and four years. \n\n&#8203; \n\nService-Based Restricted Stock Units : Service-based Restricted Stock Units, which vest over periods between two and four years, convert to shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock upon vesting.\n\n&#8203; \n\nMarket Performance-Based Awards (&#8220;the Performance Awards&#8221;) : Market performance-based Class D units of the Operating Partnership and market performance-based Restricted Stock Units covering shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s common stock may be issued to officers and employees of the Company. The Performance Awards include performance-based and time-based vesting criteria. Depending on the type of award, the total number of units that qualify to fully vest is determined based on either a market performance criterion (&#8220;Market-Based Performance Awards&#8221;) or financial performance criterion (&#8220;Financial-Based Performance Awards&#8221;) (subject to time-based vesting).\n\n&#8203; \n\nMarket-Based Performance Awards. \n\nThe market performance criterion compares the Company&#8217;s total shareholder return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) relative to the MSCI US REIT Index (&#8220;RMS&#8221;) over a three-year performance period (&#8220;Market Performance Period&#8221;), subject to continued service, in order to determine the percentage of the total eligible pool of units that qualifies to be awarded. Following the completion of the Market Performance Period, the awards then have a time-based vesting element that allows for 50% of the performance-vested units to fully vest in the February immediately following the end of the Market Performance Period and 50% of the performance-vested units to fully vest in the subsequent February. \n\nVesting with respect to the market condition is measured based on the difference between Digital Realty Trust, Inc.&#8217;s TSR percentage and the TSR percentage of the RMS as is shown in the subsequent table (the &#8220;RMS Relative Market Performance&#8221;).\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nMarket \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nPerformance \n\n&#8203; \n\nRMS Relative \n\n&#8203; \n\nVesting \n\nLevel \n\nMarket Performance \n\n&#8203; \n\nPercentage \n\nBelow Threshold Level\n\n&#8804; - 500 basis points\n\n&#8203; \n\n%\n\nThreshold Level\n\n- 500 basis points\n\n&#8203; \n\n%\n\nTarget Level\n\n0 basis points\n\n&#8203; \n\n%\n\nHigh Level\n\n&#8805; 500 basis points\n\n&#8203; \n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

The awards then have a time-based vesting element consistent with the Market-Based Performance Awards discussed above. For these awards, fair value is based on market value on the date of grant and compensation cost is recognized based on the probable achievement of the performance condition at each reporting period. The grant date fair value of these awards is $ 12.3 million, based on the Company&#8217;s closing stock price at the grant date.\n\n&#8203; \n\nFair Value of Market Performance-Based Awards \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe fair values of the Performance Awards granted were measured using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the market vesting condition being satisfied. The Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic technique based on the underlying theory of the Black-Scholes formula, which was run for 100,000 trials to determine the fair value of the awards. For each trial, the payoff to an award is calculated at the settlement date and is then discounted to the grant date at a risk-free interest rate. The total expected value of the awards on the grant date was determined by multiplying the average value per award over all trials by the number of awards granted. Assumptions used in the valuations are summarized as follows:\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nExpected Stock Price \n\n&#160; \n\nRisk-Free Interest \n\n&#8203; \n\nAward Date \n\n&#160; \n\nVolatility \n\n&#160; \n\nrate \n\n&#8203; \n\nFebruary 19, 2020\n\n&#8203; \n\n% \n\n1.39 \n\n%\n\nFebruary 20, 2020\n\n&#8203; \n\n% \n\n1.35 \n\n%\n\nJanuary 1, 2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n% \n\n0.17 \n\n%\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\n&#8203; \n\n% \n\n0.31 \n\n%\n\nJanuary 1, 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\n% \n\n0.97 \n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nThe expected stock price volatility assumption is calculated based on our historical volatility, which is calculated over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the awards being valued. The expected dividend yield assumption used in the Monte Carlo simulation represents the percent of return to a stock that is available to the holder of an award. Because the holders of the awards receive dividend equivalents, an expected dividend yield assumption of 0.00 % was used in the valuation. These valuations were performed in a risk-neutral framework, and no assumption was made with respect to an equity risk premium.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe grant date fair value of the Performance Awards was approximately $ 12.3 million, $ 25.0 million and $ 17.2 million for the years ended years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We will recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the expected service period of approximately four years .\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the Performance Awards that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 41.2 million, $ 28.6 million and $ 24.3 million, respectively.\n\n&#8203; \n\nOther Items : In addition to the LTIP Units, service-based Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards described above, one-time grants of time and/or performance-based Class D units and Restricted Stock Units were issued in connection with the Interxion Combination. These awards vest over a period of two and three years based on continued service and/or the attainment of performance metrics related to successful integration of the Interxion business. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nWe disclose fair value information for all financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data in order to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, accrued dividends and distributions, security deposits and prepaid rents approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our global revolving credit facilities and unsecured term loans approximates estimated fair value, because these liabilities have variable interest rates and our credit ratings have remained stable. Differences between the carrying value and fair value of our unsecured senior notes and secured and other debt are caused by differences in interest rates or borrowing spreads that were available to us on December 31, 2022 and 2021 as compared to those in effect when the debt was issued or assumed. As described in Note 17. \"Derivative Instruments\", outstanding derivative contracts are recorded at fair value.\n\n&#8203; \n\nWe calculate the fair value of our secured and other debt and unsecured senior notes based on currently available market rates assuming the loans are outstanding through maturity and considering the collateral and other loan terms. In determining the current market rate for fixed rate debt, a market spread is added to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our debt.\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe aggregate estimated fair value and carrying value of our global revolving credit facilities, unsecured term loans, unsecured senior notes and secured debt as of the respective periods is shown below (in thousands):\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nCategorization \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 \n\n&#8203; \n\nAs of December 31, 2021 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nunder the fair value \n\n&#8203; \n\nEstimated Fair \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEstimated Fair \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\nhierarchy \n\n&#160; \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying Value \n\n&#160; \n\nValue \n\n&#160; \n\nCarrying Value \n\nGlobal revolving credit facilities\n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 2\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,167,889 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n2,167,889 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n415,116 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n415,116 \n\nUnsecured term loans (1) \n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 2\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n802,875 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n802,875 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212;\n\nUnsecured senior notes (2) \n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 2\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n11,331,989 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n13,220,961 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n13,580,262 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n13,000,042 \n\nSecured and other debt (2) \n\n&#160;\n\nLevel 2\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n517,226 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n532,130 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n152,511 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n147,082 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n14,819,979 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n16,723,855 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n14,147,889 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n13,562,240 \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) The carrying value of our unsecured term loans approximates estimated fair value, due to the variability of interest rates and the stability of our credit ratings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Valuations for our unsecured senior notes and secured debt are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates and quoted market prices. ##TABLE_END &#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.

Subsequent Events\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and certain of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s subsidiaries entered into an escrow agreement (the &#8220;Escrow Agreement&#8221;) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221;), certain lenders (the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;), and Arnold &#38; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, as escrow agent (the &#8220;Escrow Agent&#8221;), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership, the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders delivered executed signature pages to a new term loan agreement among the Operating Partnership, the Company, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Term Loan Agreement&#8221;) to be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent and released by the Escrow Agent upon satisfaction of specific terms. On January 9, 2023, the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement were satisfied, and, on such date, the Term Loan was deemed executed and became effective. The Term Loan Agreement provides for a $ 740 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the &#8220;Term Loan Facility&#8221;). The Term Loan Facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars. The Term Loan Facility will mature on March 31, 2025, subject to one twelve-month extension option at the Operating Partnership&#8217;s option; provided, that the Operating Partnership must pay a 0.1875 % extension fee based on the then-outstanding principal amount of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility. \n\n&#8203; \n\nOn January 24, 2023, Teraco entered into a syndicated loan facility worth R 11.8 billion (approximately $ 686 million based on the exchange rate on January 24, 2023), of which R 5.7 billion (approximately $ 331 million based on the exchange rate on January 24, 2023) will be used to finance the company&#8217;s continued growth and R 6.1 billion (approximately $ 355 million based on the exchange rate on January 24, 2023) will refinance and extend the average maturity profile of existing drawn debt. The new facilities mature in December 2028. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIndex to Financial Statements \n\n&#8203; \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. \n\nDIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P. \n\nSCHEDULE III \n\nPROPERTIES AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION \n\nDecember 31, 2022 \n\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) \n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#8203;

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nOur Management&#8217;s Reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting for Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. are included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data on page 79.\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures (Digital Realty Trust, Inc.)\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company&#8217;s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and its management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As the Company does not control or manage these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities may be substantially more limited than those it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures that were in effect as of December 31, 2022. Based on the foregoing, the Company&#8217;s management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures (Digital Realty Trust, L.P.)\n\nThe Operating Partnership maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Operating Partnership&#8217;s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and its management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
