We offer our products over numerous, varied markets through our divisions operating in 45 countries. Our global scope means that we have hundreds of competitors across our various markets and product offerings. Our competitors include U.S. and non-U.S. companies. These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by product lines, end markets, geographic scope and/or geographic locations. Although each of our segments has numerous competitors, given our market and product breadth, no single competitor competes with the Company with respect to all the products we manufacture and sell. \n\nIn the Diversified Industrial Segment, Parker competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer experience, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. We believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant Diversified Industrial Segment products. We have comprehensive motion and control packages for the broadest systems capabilities. While our primary global competitors include Bosch Rexroth AG, Danaher Corporation, Danfoss A/S, Donaldson Company, Inc., Emerson Climate Technologies, Inc., Emerson/ASCO, Festo AG &#38; Co., Freudenberg-NOK, Gates Corporation, IMI/Norgren, SMC Corporation, Swagelok Company, and Trelleborg AB, none of these businesses compete with every group or product in our Diversified Industrial Segment. \n\nIn the Aerospace Systems Segment, we have developed relationships with key customers based on our advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, service, and price competitiveness. This has enabled us to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for our systems and components, as well as the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs. Further, the Aerospace Systems Segment utilizes low-cost manufacturing techniques and best cost region strategies to achieve a lower cost producer status. Although we believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products, primary global competitors for these products include Eaton Corporation plc, Honeywell International, Inc., Moog Inc., Triumph Group, Inc., Senior plc., Raytheon Collins Aerospace, Woodward, Inc. and Safran S.A. \n\nWe believe that our platform utilizing eight core technologies, which consist of electromechanical, filtration, fluid handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, refrigeration, and sealing and shielding, is a positive factor in our ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors. For both of our segments, we believe that the following factors also contribute to our ability to compete effectively: \n\n&#8226; decentralized business model; \n\n&#8226; technology breadth and interconnectivity; \n\n&#8226; engineered products with intellectual property; \n\n&#8226; long product life cycles; \n\n&#8226; balanced OEM vs. aftermarket; \n\n&#8226; low capital investment requirements; and \n\n&#8226; great generators and deployers of cash over the cycle. \n\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights, Trade Secrets, Licenses \n\nWe own a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses related to our products. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets owned by others. In addition, patent and trademark applications are pending, although there can be no assurance that further patents and trademarks will be issued. We do not depend on any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or licenses to any material extent. \n\nBacklog and Seasonal Nature of Business \n\nBacklog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. Our backlog by business segment for the past two years is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Our backlog was $7.9 billion at June 30, 2022 and $6.5 billion at June 30, 2021. Approximately 88 percent of our backlog at June 30, 2022 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. Because of the breadth and global scope of our business, our overall business is generally not seasonal in nature. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nEnvironmental Regulation \n\nCertain of our operations require the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the United States federal \"Superfund\" law, under which we have been designated as a \"potentially responsible party\" and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Superfund priority list. \n\nAs of June 30, 2022, Parker was involved in environmental remediation at various U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by us and as a \"potentially responsible party,\" along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites. \n\nWe believe that our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, we believe, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. \n\nOur reserve for environmental matters is discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\nGovernment Regulation \n\nIn addition to the environmental regulations discussed above, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products and services in the countries where we conduct business. Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of our team members, as well as financial resources. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is included in &#8220;Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nEnergy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials \n\nOur primary energy source for both of our business segments is electric power. While we cannot predict future costs of electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power is expected to be coal and natural gas from coal and natural gas reserves available to electric utilities. We are subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions of our operations due to energy curtailments. \n\nWe primarily use steel, brass, copper, aluminum, nickel, rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals as the principal raw materials in our products. We expect these materials to be available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements. \n\nAcquisitions \n\nThe Company made no acquisitions in 2022. On August 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt plc (\"Meggitt\"). The proposed Acquisition and prior year acquisitions are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nAt Parker, we align employment levels with the global needs of our business and our customers. As of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 55,090 persons that we refer to as &#8220;team members,&#8221; of whom approximately 27,890 were employed by foreign subsidiaries. \n\nOur talented and passionate team members are the foundation of Parker&#8217;s enduring growth, bringing new ideas and perspectives to enhance our safety performance, improve productivity and inspire a diverse and inclusive culture. We see a clear path to a brighter future, and it begins with providing our people the resources that enable them to find personal and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nprofessional satisfaction in their work, responsibly move our company forward and strengthen our communities, fulfilling our purpose of Enabling Engineering Breakthroughs that Lead to a Better Tomorrow . \n\nThe Win Strategy&#8482; 3.0, Purpose and Values \n\nThe Win Strategy 3.0 is Parker&#8217;s business system that defines the goals and initiatives that drive growth, transformation and success. It works with our purpose, which is a foundational element of The Win Strategy, to engage team members and create responsible and sustainable growth. \n\nThe Win Strategy has four overarching goals: Engaged People, Customer Experience, Profitable Growth and Financial Performance, supported by our shared values of a Winning Culture, Passionate People, Valued Customers and Engaged Leadership. Our shared values shape our culture and our interactions with stakeholders and the communities in which we operate and live. \n\nSafety \n\nThe safety and well-being of Parker team members is our highest priority. Our safety goal is simple: to achieve an incident-free workplace. We have reduced our Recordable Incident Rate by 72% and our Lost Time Incident Rate by 44% from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2022, the recordable incident rate per 100 team members was 0.39, compared to a recordable incident rate of 0.40 in fiscal year 2021. Our Lost Time Incident Rate in fiscal year 2022 was 0.15, compared to 0.14 per 100 team members in fiscal year 2021 (rates inclusive of recent acquisitions). \n\nBuilding on the great progress we have made, in 2021 we established new long-term safety goals. We intend to reach our goal of zero recordable incidents by 2030 through our continued focus on team member engagement and accountability, coupled with a strong framework of systems and procedures. \n\nTo help support this goal we adopted eight standards aimed at preventing serious safety incidents or an environmental impact. We also developed a new field safety program that provides guidance for team members working outside our facilities to help them identify or anticipate safety risks. Further, for leading indicator corrective action we leverage a globally deployed Gensuite &#174; operating platform in which proactive corrective action is managed and monitored and data analytics are employed to look for trends that can be proactively addressed to eliminate potential injury risk. \n\nWe engage team members in improving safety performance through High Performance Teams (\"HPTs\"). All Parker manufacturing locations have an active, chartered Safety HPT and every value stream has a representative who is responsible for safety within their area of the business. This ownership culture at the manufacturing level is an integral component of our safety program. \n\nEngaged People \n\nEngagement directly influences business performance. We strongly believe in empowering our team members to think as owners and take action to improve their areas of the business. Engagement is deeply ingrained in our culture, and as an overarching goal of The Win Strategy it is key to achieving top quartile financial performance. \n\nParker activates engagement through our HPTs, which apply the expertise and perspective of team members who are closest to the product and customer to drive improvement throughout the company. Approximately 90% of our people participate in these teams, and more than 6,500 HPTs have already been established worldwide. We closely track our progress toward support of a high performing work environment through our Global Engagement Survey. Our fiscal year 2022 survey achieved a 91% response rate with an overall engagement score of 73%, a score which exceeds our key benchmarking data by 2%. \n\nTalent Development \n\nWe have a well-defined talent development program managed through our Talent Central system, which connects all business units globally on a common platform and provides team members with visibility to skill development, career planning and learning opportunities. This shared platform is the catalyst for talent management at Parker. \n\nOur review process enables us to assess talent globally, from early-in-career roles through senior leaders. This review facilitates the identification of key talent and allows us to build meaningful development plans and align career growth opportunities. The talent process is also supported by our Integrated Career System program which illustrates career paths for various roles and the steps to advance through the organization. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nSupplementing the talent development process are Parker&#8217;s learning offerings, which help team members expand their professional skills and take ownership of their learning and development. Examples of center-led programs are our annual ethics and compliance training and cyber security training that all team members are required to complete, in addition to programs for developing supervisory and leadership skills. Functional-specific programs include HPT training, lean bootcamps and kaizen event orientations. Local and regional training includes site safety, equipment safety and site quality requirements. \n\nIn addition to formal training programs, there are a host of development tools available which include mentoring relationships, coaching and feedback, job shadowing, project bubble assignments and other stretch projects. \n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (\"DEI\") \n\nAn inclusive environment is a core tenet of Parker&#8217;s values and one of our key measures of success within The Win Strategy. Throughout our history, we have been committed to building a welcoming and inclusive workplace that respects every team member&#8217;s unique perspective. Our team members come from a diverse range of personal and professional backgrounds, and their collective talent and expertise is the driving force behind the growth and success we have achieved. Our Commitment to DEI starts with our leadership and is reflected in our CEO&#8217;s statement: Continually Build Upon the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion of Our Global Team to be Reflective of the Communities in Which We Do Business. \n\nA component of our DEI focus is to support the development and deployment of Business Resource Groups (\"BRGs\"). \n\nIn 2015, we launched Peer W, our first BRG focused on supporting the recruitment, development and retention of women at Parker. Peer W has grown into a well-developed global network of 24 local chapters and established a Mentoring Circles program in 2020. In 2021, we introduced and launched two additional BRGs which are the Nia Network, supporting the attraction, development and retention of Black team members, and Parker Next, dedicated to our team members&#8217; professional growth and personal development. \n\nWe have also established four global HPTs focused on Talent Attraction, Talent Development, Governance and Knowledge. Each team is led by a senior executive and tasked with rethinking the way we attract and develop diverse team members, share knowledge and measure our progress in fostering an inclusive culture. \n\nIn 2020, Parker appointed its first Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion to lead our continuing journey. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nAs a global employer, we are committed to offering competitive compensation and benefits, tailored in form and amount to geography, industry, experience and performance. Our programs are designed to attract team members, motivate and reward performance, drive growth and support retention.

      "text": " ITEM 1A . Risk Factors . \n\nThe following \"risk factors\" identify what we believe to be the risks that could materially adversely affect our financial and/or operational performance. These risk factors should be considered and evaluated together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes are immaterial also may impair the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nBusiness and Operational Risks \n\nRisks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions may harm our business and make it difficult to project long-term performance. \n\nOur business is sensitive to global macro-economic conditions. Future macroeconomic downturns may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our distributors, customers and suppliers, and on activity in many of the industries and markets we serve. Among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other end-market activity, global pandemics, currency exchange rates, air travel trends, difficulties entering new markets, tariffs and governmental trade and monetary policies, and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These factors may, among other things, negatively impact our level of purchases, capital expenditures, and creditworthiness, as well as our distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the Company&#8217;s revenues, operating profits, margins, and order rates. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control. If these conditions deteriorate or remain at depressed levels for extended periods, however, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nAs a global business, we are exposed to economic, political and other risks in different countries in which we operate, which could materially reduce our sales, profitability or cash flows, or materially increase our liabilities. \n\nOur net sales derived from customers outside the United States were approximately 39 percent in 2022, 40 percent in 2021 and 37 percent in 2020. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States. The Company expects net sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. Our non-U.S. operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing our domestic operations, including: \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and/or changes in monetary policy; \n\n&#8226; public health crises, including pandemics; \n\n&#8226; limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; \n\n&#8226; transportation delays and other supply chain disruptions; \n\n&#8226; political, social and economic instability and disruptions, including armed conflicts; \n\n&#8226; government embargoes, sanctions or trade restrictions; \n\n&#8226; the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; \n\n&#8226; import and export controls; \n\n&#8226; labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; \n\n&#8226; the potential for nationalization of enterprises; \n\n&#8226; difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; \n\n&#8226; limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; \n\n&#8226; potentially adverse tax consequences; and \n\n&#8226; difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis. \n\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. \n\nIncreased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime have posed and could continue to pose a risk to our information technology systems and a disruption to or breach in the security of such systems, if material, could have adverse effects on our result of operations and financial condition. \n\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business, some of which are managed by third parties. The security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. If these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware or software break-ins or extortion attempts, or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, certain of our employees work remotely at times, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. In addition to existing risks, any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks, breaches, or failures, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the Company has access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls, security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or employee errors and/or malfeasance have led and could in the future lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information. Such events may result in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, failure to comply with laws governing sensitive data, loss of reputation, intellectual property, competitiveness or customers, increased security and compliance costs or other negative consequences. Further, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident. Depending on the nature and magnitude of these events, they may have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. \n\nPrice and supply fluctuations of the raw materials used in our production processes and by our suppliers of component parts could negatively impact our financial results. \n\nOur supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Furthermore, changes to United States and other countries' tariff and import/export regulations have in the past and may in the future have a negative impact on the availability and pricing of raw materials. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have \n\nTable of Contents \n\nfluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins. Our efforts to manage these fluctuations by, among other things, passing along price increases to our customers, may be subject to a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors. Any such inability to manage fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. As a result, we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs. Consequently, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic has disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors, has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to negatively impact our operations in the future, which impact may be material. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Furthermore, several of our customers temporarily suspended their operations and we have experienced less demand for our products. Disruptions to our customers in the aerospace industry, which is facing diminished demand, have been and may continue to be challenging. Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak has, and could further, disrupt our supply chain. Facility closures or other restrictions, as well as supply chain disruptions, could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff, supply or otherwise maintain our operations. Moreover, because certain of our employees work remotely at times, we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. We have modified, and may further modify, our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful. \n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration, severity and disruption to our business, customers and supply chain, and the related financial impact to us, cannot be accurately forecasted at this time. Should such disruption continue for an extended period, the adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be more severe than previously anticipated. Additionally, weak economic conditions generally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets. Furthermore, future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above. \n\nChanges in the demand for and supply of our products may adversely affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flow. \n\nDemand for and supply of our products has been and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. Such factors include: \n\n&#8226; changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, and changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, including changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; changes in product mix; \n\n&#8226; changes in the market acceptance of our products; \n\n&#8226; increased competition in the markets we serve; \n\n&#8226; declines in the general level of industrial production, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; weakness in the end-markets we serve, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in the availability or the prices of raw materials; and \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n\nIf any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of our products could suffer, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations. \n\nThe development of new products and technologies requires substantial investment and is required to remain competitive in the markets we serve. If we are unable to successfully introduce new commercial products, our profitability could be adversely affected. \n\nThe markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. If we cannot develop, or have difficulties or delays developing new and enhanced products and services, or if we fail to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies, our \n\nTable of Contents \n\nrevenues may be materially reduced and our competitive position could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we may invest in research and development of products and services, or in acquisitions or other investments, that do not lead to significant revenue, which could adversely affect our profitability. \n\nChanges in the competitive environment in which we operate may eliminate any competitive advantages that we currently have, which could adversely impact our business. \n\nOur operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global, regional and local competitors, which could adversely affect our results of operations by creating downward pricing pressure and/or a decline in our margins or market shares. To compete successfully, we must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, technological and engineering capability, manufacturing and distribution capability, delivery, price competitiveness, and customer experience. \n\nWe may be required to make material expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and climate change and legal or regulatory measures to address climate change may negatively impact our business. \n\nOur operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, subject us to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as non-U.S. laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. Among other laws, we are subject to the U.S. federal \"Superfund\" law, under which we have been designated as a \"potentially responsible party\" and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Superfund priority list. We could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the \"Superfund\" law. \n\nIn addition, increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. We are not able to predict how such regulations would affect our business, operations or financial results, but increased regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. \n\nFurther, climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations. Extreme weather events linked to climate change, including hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, high heat and water scarcity, among others, create physical risks to our operating locations and supply chains. Although we are working towards and intend to meet our goal of making our own operations carbon neutral by 2040, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our climate-related goals will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving our goals will meet customer expectations and needs, investor expectations or market standards regarding sustainability performance. \n\nStrategic Transactions Risks \n\nWe are subject to risks relating to the pending acquisition of Meggitt. \n\nOn August 2, 2021, we announced our proposed acquisition of Meggitt. Meggitt is a leader in design, manufacturing and aftermarket support of technologically differentiated systems and equipment in aerospace, defense and selected energy markets. \n\nThe proposed acquisition of Meggitt would expand the size of our Aerospace Systems Segment relative to our other segment, increasing our susceptibility to conditions in the end markets served by our Aerospace Systems Segment. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition, including: \n\n&#8226; completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Among these conditions are the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; the Company&#8217;s and Meggitt&#8217;s existing business relationships with third parties, including customers and service providers, may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position or those of the combined company; \n\n&#8226; failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results; \n\n&#8226; both we and Meggitt will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition, which costs may exceed those currently anticipated; \n\n&#8226; we have substantially increased our indebtedness to pay for the Acquisition and other related fees and expenses; \n\n&#8226; the COVID-19 pandemic may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition; \n\n&#8226; after completion of the acquisition, we may be unable to successfully integrate our and Meggitt&#8217;s business and, as a result, may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction in the intended timeframe or at all, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock; \n\n&#8226; our results after the proposed acquisition of Meggitt may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the acquisition; and \n\n&#8226; Meggitt may have difficulty retaining, motivating, and attracting executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition, and failure to do so could harm the company. \n\nAny of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nWe are subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint ventures, and risks relating to the integration of acquired companies, including risks related to the integration of Lord Corporation (\"Lord\") and Exotic Metals Forming Company (\"Exotic\") and the potential acquisition of Meggitt. \n\nWe expect to continue our strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which we believe will enhance our operations and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities, or that we will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms. Furthermore, there are no assurances that we will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities. If we are unable to avoid these risks, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate successfully any businesses that we purchase into our existing business and it is possible that any acquired businesses or joint ventures may not be profitable. For example, we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of Lord and Exotic. We may encounter, or have encountered, the following difficulties during the integration process: \n\n&#8226; the consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the cost of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions may not be realized; \n\n&#8226; delays in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products, and services; \n\n&#8226; differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies that may delay successful integration; \n\n&#8226; the ability to retain key employees; \n\n&#8226; the ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems; \n\n&#8226; challenges of integrating complex systems, technologies, networks, and other assets of the acquired companies in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact or disruptions to customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies; and \n\n&#8226; unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration beyond current estimates. \n\nThe successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures also depend on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. If we are unable to avoid these risks, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nOur results may be adversely affected if expanded operations from the acquisition of Lord and Exotic, and the potential acquisition of Meggitt, are not effectively managed. \n\nOur recent acquisitions have greatly expanded the size and complexity of our business. Our future success depends, in part, on the ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose or has posed substantial challenges for management, \n\nTable of Contents \n\nincluding challenges related to the management and monitoring of the expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products, and the associated costs and complexity. There can be no assurance of successful management of these matters or that we will realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions. \n\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes. \n\nWe regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. We also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. The Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nIncreasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our liability for such benefits. \n\nThe funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations. \n\nThe Company absorbs a portion of healthcare costs for its employees. If healthcare costs rise significantly and we continue to absorb the majority of these costs, these increasing costs may adversely impact our future results of operations. \n\nAdditional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in overall profitability, changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the Company is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from estimated amounts, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company&#8217;s tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and cash flow. \n\nOur indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility. \n\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, and may incur additional debt for acquisitions, operations, research and development and capital expenditures, or for other reasons related to our overall capital deployment strategy. Our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and meet restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook. These changes could increase our cost of financing and limit our debt capacity, thereby limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. \n\nWe carry goodwill on our balance sheet, which is subject to impairment testing and could subject us to significant non-cash charges to earnings in the future if impairment occurs. \n\nWe have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually in the second quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist. Factors that could indicate that our goodwill is impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment. Impairment testing incorporates our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating \n\nTable of Contents \n\nresults and cash flows. If we determine at a future time that further impairment exists, it may result in a significant non-cash charge to earnings and lower stockholders&#8217; equity. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \n\nAs a provider of products to the U.S. government, we are subject to additional risks related to future government spending as well as unusual performance conditions and enhanced compliance risks. \n\nIn addition to the risks identified herein, doing business with the U.S. government subjects us to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental acquisition regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform, or other unsatisfactory performance under the applicable contract. We are subject to government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government acquisition regulations. If the Company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, and we could be subject to fines or penalties associated with contract non-compliance or resulting from such investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nLitigation and legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company could decrease our liquidity, impair our financial condition and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. An unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, as required by U.S. GAAP, we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\nWe are subject to national and international laws and regulations, such as the anti-corruption laws of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to our business and our employees. Despite our policies, procedures and compliance programs, our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the Company from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations. Any such improper acts could damage the Company's reputation, subject us to civil or criminal judgments, fines or penalties, and could otherwise disrupt the Company's business, and as a result, could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nFurther, our operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the United States and Europe. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. Accordingly, any violation of these laws could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nDue to the nature of our business and products, we may be liable for damages based on product liability claims. \n\nOur businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors that we use or resell. Significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that our insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential significant liabilities. \n\nFailure to protect our intellectual property and know-how could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage and reduce our sales and profitability, and the cost of protecting our intellectual property may be significant. \n\nProtecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own a number of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade names and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services throughout the world and in the operation of our business. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by others. Our intellectual property may be challenged, stolen or otherwise infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to \n\nTable of Contents \n\nmaintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. In addition, the global nature of our business increases the risk that our intellectual property may be subject to infringement, theft or other unauthorized use or disclosure by others. In some cases, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. And the cost of enforcing our rights may be significant. Unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property rights or our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could lead to reputational harm and/or adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. \n\n"

Often but not always, these statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;is likely,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. Neither the Company nor any of its respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually occur. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from past performance or current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. Additionally, the actual impact of changes in tax laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and any judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof on future performance and earnings projections may impact the Company&#8217;s tax calculations. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance. \n\nAmong other factors which may affect future performance are: \n\n&#8226; changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments; \n\n&#8226; disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix; \n\n&#8226; the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and governmental and other actions taken in response; \n\n&#8226; ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of Lord and Exotic and the proposed acquisition of Meggitt; and our ability to effectively manage expanded operations from the acquisitions of Lord and Exotic and the proposed acquisition of Meggitt; \n\n&#8226; the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures; \n\n&#8226; the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities; \n\n&#8226; ability to implement successfully capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases; \n\n&#8226; availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing; \n\n&#8226; ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits; \n\n&#8226; legal and regulatory developments and changes; \n\n&#8226; additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; \n\n&#8226; ability to enter into, own, renew, protect and maintain intellectual property and know-how; \n\n&#8226; leverage and future debt service obligations; \n\n&#8226; potential impairment of goodwill; \n\n&#8226; compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations; \n\n&#8226; potential labor disruptions or shortages; \n\n&#8226; uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; \n\n&#8226; global competitive market conditions, including U.S. trade policies and resulting effects on sales and pricing; \n\n&#8226; global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates, credit availability and changes in consumer habits and preferences; \n\n&#8226; local and global political and economic conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine war and its residual effects; \n\nTable of Contents \n\n&#8226; inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals; \n\n&#8226; government actions and natural phenomena such as pandemics, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural phenomena that may be related to climate change; \n\n&#8226; increased cyber security threats and sophisticated computer crime; and \n\n&#8226; success of business and operating initiatives. \n\nThe Company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law. \n\nOverview \n\nThe Company is a global leader in motion and control technologies. For more than a century, the Company has engineered the success of its customers in a wide range of diversified industrial and aerospace markets. \n\nBy aligning around our purpose, Enabling Engineering Breakthroughs that Lead to a Better Tomorrow, Parker is better positioned for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow. \n\nThe Win Strategy 3.0 is Parker's business system that defines the goals and initiatives that drive growth, transformation and success. It works with our purpose, which is a foundational element of The Win Strategy, to engage team members and create responsible and sustainable growth. Our shared values shape our culture and our interactions with stakeholders and the communities in which we operate and live. \n\nWe believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. We believe we can meet our strategic objectives by: \n\n&#8226; Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company; \n\n&#8226; Successfully executing The Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance; \n\n&#8226; Maintaining a decentralized division and sales company structure; \n\n&#8226; Fostering a safety-first and entrepreneurial culture; \n\n&#8226; Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity; \n\n&#8226; Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver; \n\n&#8226; Enabling a sustainable future by providing innovative technology solutions that offer a positive, global environmental impact and operating responsibly by reducing our energy use and emissions; \n\n&#8226; Acquiring strategic businesses; \n\n&#8226; Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets; \n\n&#8226; Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and \n\n&#8226; Creating a culture of empowerment through our values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork. \n\nOur order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. \n\nRecent events impacting our business include the Russia-Ukraine war and COVID-19 pandemic and their residual effects, including the inflationary cost environment as well as disruption within the global supply chain, labor markets and aerospace industry. In compliance with international sanctions, we immediately suspended all shipments to and from Russia and, in March 2022, we closed our office and warehouse facility in Moscow. We do not expect our exit of business operations in Russia to materially impact future business, operations or financial results. \n\nDespite disruption within the aerospace industry, including ongoing travel restrictions, commercial aerospace demand is beginning to recover. We are managing the challenging supply chain environment through our \"local for local\" manufacturing strategy, ongoing supplier management process, and broadened supply base. We are also managing the inflationary cost environment through a variety of cost and pricing measures, including continuous improvement and lean initiatives. Additionally, we are strategically managing our workforce and discretionary spending. At the same time, we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we may continue to serve our customers. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nWe continue to prioritize the safety of our team members. To minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces, we implemented heightened prevention, screening and hygiene protocols. Our actions have varied depending on the spread of COVID-19 in the communities in which we operate, applicable government requirements and the needs of our employees, customers and business. \n\nOver the long term, the extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by the economic and political uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that remain uncertain. These developments include the duration of the supply chain and labor market constraints, the severity and duration of the Russia-Ukraine war and related sanctions, distribution and continuing effectiveness of vaccines, the severity and spread of COVID-19 and its variants and mitigating actions by government authorities. Additionally, while these events and other global economic factors have led to an increased inflationary environment, we will continue to monitor and manage inflation to minimize its impact on our business, operations, and financial results. \n\nAs previously announced, on March 14, 2022, we detected that an unauthorized party gained access to our systems. After securing our network and concluding our investigation, we found that the data exfiltrated during the incident included personal information of our team members. We have notified individuals whose personal information was involved and offered them credit monitoring services. We have also provided notification regarding the incident to the appropriate regulatory authorities. A consolidated class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against the Company over the incident. Based on our ongoing assessments, the incident has not had a significant financial or operational impact and has not had a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. \n\nThe discussion below is structured to separately discuss the Consolidated Statement of Income, Business Segments, and Liquidity and Capital Resources. The term \"year\" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year. Discussion of the 2020 financial statements is included in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME \n\nThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance. The discussion below compares the operating performance in 2022 and 2021. \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 15,862 &#160; $ 14,348 Gross profit margin 28.2 &#160; % 27.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,627 &#160; $ 1,527 Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales 10.3 &#160; % 10.6 % Interest expense $ 255 &#160; $ 250 Other expense (income), net 985 &#160; (17) Gain on disposal of assets (7) (109) Effective tax rate 18.5 &#160; % 22.3 % Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,316 &#160; $ 1,746 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales in 2022 increased from the 2021 amount due to higher volume in both the Diversified Industrial and Aerospace Systems Segments. The effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2022 by approximately $255 million, substantially all of which is attributable to the Diversified Industrial International businesses. \n\nGross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2022 primarily due to higher margins in both the Aerospace Systems and Diversified Industrial Segments. The increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases, partially offset by increased freight, material and labor costs resulting from the ongoing inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain and labor markets. Cost of sales included net foreign currency transaction gains of $40 million and $11 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cost of sales also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $9 million in 2022 compared to $35 million in 2021. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&#38;A\") increased in 2022 primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs of $44 million as well as higher net expense from the Company's deferred compensation plan and related investments and higher professional fees and related expenses. SG&#38;A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $10 million and $23 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nInterest expense in 2022 increased primarily due to higher average debt outstanding, partially offset by lower average interest rates. \n\nOther expense (income), net included the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Expense (income) Income related to equity method investments $ (76) $ (41) Non-service components of retirement benefit cost 4 &#160; 49 Acquisition-related financing fees 52 &#160; &#8212; Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts 1,015 &#160; &#8212; Russia liquidation 8 &#160; &#8212; Other items, net (18) (25) $ 985 &#160; $ (17) ##TABLE_END\n\nAcquisition-related financing fees in 2022 relate to the bridge credit agreement (the \"Bridge Credit Agreement\") fees associated with the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nLoss on deal-contingent forward contracts in 2022 includes an unrealized loss on the deal-contingent forward contracts related to the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nGain on disposal of assets in 2021 primarily consists of a gain of $101 million on the sale of land. \n\nEffective tax rate in 2022 was lower than 2021 primarily due to an overall increase in discrete tax benefits. \n\nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nThe Business Segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making. \n\nDiversified Industrial Segment \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Net Sales North America $ 7,703 &#160; $ 6,676 International 5,639 &#160; 5,284 Operating income North America 1,515 &#160; 1,247 International $ 1,178 &#160; $ 988 Operating income as a percent of sales North America 19.7 &#160; % 18.7 % International 20.9 &#160; % 18.7 % Backlog $ 4,510 &#160; $ 3,239 ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: ##TABLE_START 2022 Diversified Industrial North America &#8211; as reported 15.4 % Currency 0.1 % \n\nDiversified Industrial North America &#8211; without currency 1 \n\n15.3 % Diversified Industrial International &#8211; as reported 6.7 % Currency (4.9) % \n\nDiversified Industrial International &#8211; without currency 1 \n\n11.6 % Total Diversified Industrial Segment &#8211; as reported 11.6 % Currency (2.0) % \n\nTotal Diversified Industrial Segment &#8211; without currency 1 \n\n13.6 % ##TABLE_END\n\n1 The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period. \n\nNet Sales \n\nDiversified Industrial North America - Sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.4 percent from 2021. The effect of currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately $7 million. Excluding the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.3 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in virtually all markets, including, the farm and agriculture, life sciences, heavy-duty truck, construction equipment, engines, refrigeration, material handling, metal fabrication, and semiconductor markets. \n\nDiversified Industrial International - Sales in the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 6.7 percent in 2022. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $256 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, Turkey and Japan. Excluding the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 11.6 percent from 2021 levels. During 2022, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America accounted for approximately 70 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales. \n\nWithin Europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, heavy-duty truck, industrial machinery, life sciences, machine tool, mining, material handling, engines, and forestry markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the cars and light trucks, semiconductor, telecommunications, and oil and gas markets. \n\nWithin the Asia Pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the semiconductor, refrigeration, industrial machinery, life sciences, and machine tool markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the engines, power generation, heavy-duty truck, railroad equipment, and material handling markets. \n\nWithin Latin America, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the farm and agriculture, cars and light trucks, mining, heavy-duty truck, construction equipment, and industrial machinery markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the power generation and life sciences markets. \n\nOperating Margin \n\nOperating margins in 2022 increased in both the North American and International businesses primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases. These increases were partially offset by increased operating costs, including higher freight, material, and labor costs resulting from the ongoing disruption within the current supply chain environment and labor market. In addition, within the International businesses, operating margin in 2022 benefited from savings related to prior-year restructuring actions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBusiness Realignment \n\nThe following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Diversified Industrial North America $ 4 &#160; $ 14 Diversified Industrial International 14 &#160; 36 ##TABLE_END\n\nIn both fiscal 2022 and 2021, business realignment charges included severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, as well as plant closures. During fiscal 2021, business realignment charges primarily consisted of actions taken to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Acquisition integration charges relate to the 2020 acquisition of Lord. Business realignment and acquisition integration charges within the Diversified Industrial International businesses were primarily incurred in Europe. \n\nWe anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2022 will increase operating income in 2023 by approximately one percent in the Diversified Industrial International businesses and will not materially impact operating income in the Diversified Industrial North American businesses. In 2023, we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $31 million in business realignment charges in 2023. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. \n\nDuring 2022, we also incurred $6 million of expense within the Diversified Industrial International businesses as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items. \n\nBacklog \n\nThe increase in Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2022 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the North American and International businesses. Backlog within the North American and International businesses accounted for approximately 75 percent and 25 percent of the change, respectively. Within the International business, the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America accounted for approximately 60 percent, 30 percent, and 10 percent of the change, respectively. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. \n\nAerospace Systems Segment \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Sales $ 2,520 &#160; $ 2,388 Operating income 501 &#160; 403 Operating income as a percent of sales 19.9 &#160; % 16.9 % Backlog $ 3,340 &#160; $ 3,264 ##TABLE_END\n\nSales \n\nAerospace Systems Segment sales in 2022 were higher than the 2021 level primarily due to higher commercial aftermarket and OEM volume, partially offset by lower military OEM and aftermarket volume. \n\nOperating Margin \n\nAerospace Systems Segment operating margin increased in 2022 primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable commercial aftermarket product mix, higher aftermarket profitability as well as lower unfunded engineering development expenses. These benefits were partially offset by challenges created by the ongoing inflationary environment, disruption within the supply chain and labor markets as well as unfavorable commercial OEM product mix. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nBusiness Realignment \n\nDuring 2022, we incurred $7 million of expense within the Aerospace Systems Segment as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items. \n\nWe expect to incur approximately $4 million in business realignment charges in 2023. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. The amount of acquisition integration charges we will incur in 2023 is dependent upon the timing of closing of the proposed Acquisition. \n\nBacklog \n\nThe increase in Aerospace Systems Segment backlog in 2022 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the military OEM and aftermarket businesses. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. \n\nCorporate general &#38; administrative expenses \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Expense (income) Corporate general and administrative expense $ 220 &#160; $ 178 Corporate general and administrative expense, as a percent of sales 1.4 &#160; % 1.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nCorporate general and administrative expenses increased in 2022 primarily due to higher net expense from the Company's deferred compensation plan and related investments, higher professional fees and related expenses as well as higher incentive compensation expense. These expenses were partially offset by lower pension expense. \n\nOther expense (income) (in Business Segments) \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Expense (income) Foreign currency transaction $ (40) $ (11) Stock-based compensation 63 &#160; 61 Pensions (16) 22 Acquisition-related expenses 96 &#160; 5 Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts 1,015 &#160; &#8212; Gain on disposal of assets (7) (109) Russia liquidation 7 &#160; &#8212; Other items, net (12) (5) $ 1,106 &#160; $ (37) ##TABLE_END\n\nForeign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. \n\nAcquisition-related expenses in 2022 include Bridge Credit Agreement financing fees and transaction costs related to the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nLoss on deal-contingent forward contracts in 2022 includes an unrealized loss on the deal-contingent forward contracts related to the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nGain on disposal of assets in 2021 primarily consists of a gain of $101 million on the sale of land. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nWe believe that we are great generators and deployers of cash. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and meet our strategic capital deployment objectives, which include the following: \n\n&#8226; Continuing our record annual dividend increases \n\n&#8226; Investing in organic growth and productivity \n\n&#8226; Strategic acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio \n\n&#8226; Offset share dilution through 10b5-1 share repurchase program \n\nCash Flows \n\nA summary of cash flows follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,442 &#160; $ 2,575 Investing activities (419) &#8212; Financing activities 3,916 &#160; (2,623) Effect of exchange rates (24) 96 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 5,915 &#160; $ 48 ##TABLE_END\n\nCash flows from operating activities were $2,442 million in 2022 compared to $2,575 million in 2021. This decrease of $133 million was primarily related to net income and cash provided by working capital items, which decreased $431 million and increased $557 million, respectively. After consideration of the non-cash impact of the deal-contingent forward contracts, which increased cash provided by working capital items by $1,015 million and decreased net income by $775 million in 2022, cash flow from operations in 2022 decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by working capital items of $458 million, partially offset by an increase in net income of $344 million. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the deal-contingent forward contracts. \n\n&#8226; Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 51 days in 2022 and 50 days in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Days supply of inventory on hand was 77 days in 2022 and 75 days in 2021. \n\nCash flows from investing activities in 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the following factors: \n\n&#8226; Net maturities of marketable securities of $4 million in 2022 compared to $45 million in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Capital expenditures of $230 million in 2022 compared to $210 million in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net proceeds from the sale of land of approximately $111 million in 2021. \n\n&#8226; Cash collateral paid of $250 million in 2022 per the credit support annex (\"CSA\") attached to the deal-contingent forward contracts. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nCash flows from financing activities in 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the following factors: \n\n&#8226; Repurchases of 1.3 million common shares for $380 million during 2022 compared to repurchases of 0.3 million common shares for $100 million during 2021. \n\n&#8226; Net proceeds from Senior Notes issuance of $3,576 million in 2022 compared to term loan repayments of $1,210 million in 2021. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\n&#8226; Net commercial paper borrowings of $1,422 million in 2022 compared to net commercial paper repayments of $723 million in 2021. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCash Requirements \n\nWe are actively monitoring our liquidity position and remain focused on managing our inventory and other working capital requirements. We are continuing to target two percent of sales for capital expenditures and are prioritizing those related to safety and strategic investments. We believe that cash generated from operations and our commercial paper program will satisfy our operating needs for the foreseeable future. \n\nWe have committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, and postretirement benefit obligations. Refer to Notes 10, 11, and 12 respectively, of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nDividends \n\nDividends have been paid for 288 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 66 years. The current annual dividend rate is $5.32 per common share. \n\nShare Repurchases \n\nThe Company has a program to repurchase its common shares. On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year. Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nLiquidity \n\nCash, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, includes $465 million and $467 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. The distribution of these earnings could result in non-federal U.S. or foreign taxes. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested. \n\nWe are currently authorized to sell up to $3,000 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $1,422 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2022, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1,682 million. \n\nThe Company has a line of credit through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. During 2022, we amended our existing multi-currency credit agreement, increasing its capacity from $2,500 million to $3,000 million, by exercising the accordion feature. As of June 30, 2022, $1,578 million was available for borrowing under the credit agreement. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement supports our commercial paper program, and issuances of commercial paper reduce the amount of credit available under the agreement. The credit agreement expires in September 2024; however, the Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the Company&#8217;s credit ratings. Although a lowering of the Company&#8217;s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company&#8217;s ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nWe primarily utilize unsecured medium-term notes and senior notes to meet our financing needs and we expect to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. During 2022, the Company issued $1,400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65 percent Senior Notes due June 15, 2024, $1,200 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2027, and $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2029 (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"). We intend to use the proceeds of the Senior Notes to finance a portion of the purchase of the proposed Acquisition. Refer to the Cash flows from financing activities section above and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Additionally, during 2022, we entered into a senior, unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million (the &#8220;Term Loan Facility&#8221;), refer to the Strategic Acquisitions section below for further discussion. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. Based on the Company&#8217;s rating level at June 30, 2022, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At June 30, \n\nTable of Contents \n\n2022, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.57 to 1.0. We are in compliance, and expect to remain in compliance, with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures. \n\nOur goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. The rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. At June 30, 2022, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Fitch Ratings BBB+ Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Baa1 Standard &#38; Poor's BBB+ ##TABLE_END\n\nSupply Chain Financing \n\nWe continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. We currently have a supply chain financing program (\"SCF\") with a financial intermediary, which provides certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediary earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial intermediary and the suppliers in connection with the programs. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program and their participation is completely voluntary. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At June 30, 2022, accounts payable included approximately $46 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. In 2022, the amount settled through the SCF program and paid to participating financial institutions totaled $35 million. We account for payments made under the program in the same manner as our other accounts payable, which is a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity. \n\nStrategic Acquisitions \n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt for 800 pence per share, or approximately &#163;6,263 million. We intend to fund the proposed Acquisition with cash resources, borrowings under debt facilities and net proceeds of debt securities. The proposed Acquisition received the European Commission's clearance on April 11, 2022, conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by the Company, including a commitment to divest its aircraft wheel and brake business within the Aerospace Systems Segment, for which a divestiture agreement was signed on May 23, 2022. The proposed Acquisition and divestiture of the aircraft wheel and brake business remain subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearance. \n\nDuring 2022 we deposited funds, comprised of cash on hand and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the Senior Notes, into an escrow account. The escrow account is restricted to payments for the proposed Acquisition. At June 30, 2022, the balance was $6,112 million, which was recorded within the prepaid expenses and other caption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nAdditionally, we entered into a senior, unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million on August 27, 2021. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility, if drawn, will be used solely by the Company to finance a portion of the consideration of its proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nIn connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into a bridge credit agreement (the \"Bridge Credit Agreement\") on August 2, 2021. Under the Bridge Credit Agreement, lenders committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of &#163;6,524 million at August 2, 2021. As permanent financing for the proposed Acquisition was secured, the principal amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement was reduced. At June 30, 2022, the available aggregate principal amount was &#163;591 million. In July 2022, we issued $504 million of commercial paper and deposited this amount into the escrow account to finance a portion of the purchase of Meggitt. Additionally, in July 2022, we deposited a total of $250 million into escrow that was previously posted as collateral and recorded within non-trade and notes receivables at June 30, 2022. Refer to Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. In July 2022, after consideration of the escrow balance and funds available under the delayed-draw Term Loan Facility, we reduced the aggregate committed principal amount of the bridge credit agreement (the \"Bridge Credit Agreement\") to zero. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into deal-contingent forward contracts during October 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the GBP-denominated purchase price. The deal-contingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of &#163;6,415 million, and settlement is contingent upon closing the proposed Acquisition. We are recording the related fair value gains and losses, which have been and may continue to be significant, through the Consolidated Statement of Income until the closing of the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment. \n\nFor contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues. \n\nWhen there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer. \n\nWe consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time. \n\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, the Company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. We also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization. \n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units. The results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. We continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit's fair value as appropriate. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nLong-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2022, the Company did not record any material impairment related to long-lived assets. \n\nPensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. \n\nFor the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $17 million and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $19 million. As of June 30, 2022, $472 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help offset the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nIncome Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nLoss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. We review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances. \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . \n\nThe Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. \n\nIn connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into deal-contingent forward contracts during October 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the GBP-denominated purchase price. The deal-contingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of &#163;6,415 million, and settlement is contingent upon closing the proposed Acquisition. A one percent decrease in the GBP-USD exchange rate would result in a $78 million decrease in the fair value of the contract. \n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For cross-currency swaps measured using the spot method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. The translation of the foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated. \n\nThe Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. At June 30, 2022, our debt portfolio did not include any variable rate debt. However, a 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on weighted average commercial paper balances during 2022 by approximately $15 million. \n\nAs discussed elsewhere in this report, the future impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic and their residual effects, including economic uncertainty, inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain, labor markets and aerospace industry, on our business remain uncertain. As we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n"

We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a \n\nTable of Contents \n\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRevenue &#8212; Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements \n\nCritical Audit Matter Description \n\nThe Company is a highly diversified business with revenue derived from the sales of products in a variety of industrial and aerospace markets. The Company&#8217;s business activities are carried out by numerous individual business units, which offer unique technology and product platforms in a large number of geographic areas. \n\nWe identified revenue as a critical audit matter due to the geographical dispersion of the Company&#8217;s operations and business units generating revenue. Extensive audit effort is performed due to the volume of the underlying transactions and number of individual business units. High levels of auditor judgment were necessary to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures performed to audit revenue. \n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company&#8217;s revenue transactions included the following, among others: \n\n&#8226; We tested the design and effectiveness of internal controls within the revenue business processes, including controls over revenue recognition and controls over the review of operating results. \n\n&#8226; We performed transaction testing for revenue populations subject to detail testing by agreeing the amounts recorded as revenue to source documents and determined that revenue was recognized appropriately. \n\n&#8226; We tested the completeness of revenue for revenue populations subject to detail testing, by making selections from a reciprocal population (e.g. sales order listing) and determined whether the sales order was appropriately recorded as a sale in the general ledger. \n\n&#8226; We performed substantive analytical procedures for revenue transactions not subject to detail transaction testing. We developed independent expectations of revenue based on data derived from published industry indices, market and customer trends, and the results of our detail revenue testing and compared these expectations to the revenue recorded by management. \n\n/s/ DELOITTE &#38; TOUCHE LLP \n\nCleveland, Ohio \n\nAugust 24, 2022 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME \n\n##TABLE_START For the years ended June 30, (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net Sales $ 15,861,608 &#160;

Significant Accounting Policies \n\nThe significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below. \n\nNature of Operations - The Company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. We evaluate performance based on segment operating income before corporate administrative expenses, interest expense and income taxes. \n\nThere are no individual customers to whom sales are more than two percent of the Company's consolidated sales. Due to our diverse group of customers throughout the world, we do not consider ourself exposed to any concentration of credit risks. \n\nThe Company manufactures and markets its products throughout the world. Although certain risks and uncertainties exist, the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes with respect to any particular product and geographic operation would materially affect our operating results. \n\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nBasis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and profits have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements. Within the business segment information, inter-segment and inter-area sales have been eliminated. \n\nRevenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. When revenue is recognized at a point in time, control generally transfers at time of shipment. Revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as the Company performs work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product produced for the customer has no alternative use and the Company has a contractual right to payment. \n\nFor contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of these costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. We make adjustments to these estimates on a consistent basis and establish a contract reserve when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues. \n\nA contract&#8217;s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers of the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer. \n\nWe consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration primarily includes prompt pay discounts, rebates and volume discounts and is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time. \n\nPayment terms vary by customer and the geographic location of the customer. The time between when revenue is recognized and payment is due is not significant. Our contracts with customers generally do not include significant financing components or noncash consideration. \n\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. The costs to obtain a contract where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThere is generally no unilateral right to return products. The Company primarily offers an assurance-type standard warranty that the product will conform to certain specifications for a defined period of time or usage after delivery. This type of warranty does not represent a separate performance obligation. \n\nCash - Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost plus accrued interest and are readily convertible into cash. \n\nMarketable Securities and Other Investments - Consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase, which are carried at cost plus accrued interest. Marketable securities and other investments also include investments in equity securities which are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value related to equity securities are recorded in net income. We have the ability to liquidate these investments after giving appropriate notice to the issuer. \n\nTrade Accounts Receivable, Net - Trade accounts receivable are initially recorded at their net collectible amount and are generally recorded at the time the revenue from the sales transaction is recorded. We evaluate the collectibility of our receivables based on historical experience and current and forecasted economic conditions based on management's judgment. Additionally, receivables are written off to bad debt when management makes a final determination of uncollectibility. Allowance for credit losses was $ 10 million and $ 12 million at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nNon-Trade and Notes Receivable - The non-trade and notes receivable caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components: \n\n##TABLE_START June 30, 2022 2021 Notes receivable $ 103,558 &#160; $ 144,441 &#160; \n\nCash collateral receivable (a) \n\n250,000 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Accounts receivable, other 190,199 &#160; 181,874 &#160; Total $ 543,757 &#160; $ 326,315 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) The cash collateral receivable relates to the deal-contingent forward contracts. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. \n\n&#160; \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated principally using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation rates are based on estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements and building equipment, seven to 10 years for machinery and equipment, and three to eight years for vehicles and office equipment. Improvements, which extend the useful life of property, are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are expensed. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. When property, plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the appropriate accounts and any gain or loss is included in current income. \n\n&#160; The property, plant and equipment caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components: \n\n##TABLE_START June 30, 2022 2021 Land and land improvements $ 322,024 &#160; $ 342,950 &#160; Buildings and building equipment 1,783,805 &#160; 1,848,141 &#160; Machinery and equipment 3,588,106 &#160; 3,653,566 &#160; Construction in progress 204,020 &#160; 195,563 &#160; Total $ 5,897,955 &#160; $ 6,040,220 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nTable of Contents \n\nInvestments and Other Assets - Investments in joint-venture companies in which ownership is 50 percent or less and in which the Company does not have operating control are stated at cost plus the Company's equity in undistributed earnings and amounted to $ 314 million and $ 292 million at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A significant portion of the underlying net assets of the joint ventures are related to goodwill. The Company's share of earnings from investments in joint-venture companies were $ 76 million, $ 41 million and $ 75 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIntangible Assets - Intangible assets primarily include patents and technology, trademarks and customer lists and contracts and are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line method. Patents and technology are amortized over the shorter of their remaining useful or legal life. Trademarks and customer contracts are amortized over the estimated time period over which an economic benefit is expected to be received. Customer lists are amortized over a period based on anticipated customer attrition rates. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. \n\nGoodwill - The Company conducts a formal impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. \n\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are provided based upon income for financial reporting purposes. Taxes related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") are treated as a current period expense when incurred. Tax credits and similar tax incentives are applied to reduce the provision for income taxes in the year in which the credits arise. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized in income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax purposes. Income tax effects resulting from adjusting temporary differences recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) are released when the circumstances on which they are based cease to exist. \n\nForeign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss). Such adjustments will affect net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investments. Exchange (gains) losses from transactions in a currency other than the local currency of the entity involved are included within the cost of sales caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income and were $( 40 ) million, $( 11 ) million and $( 10 ) million, in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nSubsequent Events - We evaluated subsequent events that have occurred through the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. In July 2022, we issued $ 504 million of commercial paper and deposited this amount into the escrow account to finance a portion of the purchase of Meggitt. Additionally, in July 2022, we deposited a total of $ 250 million into escrow that was previously posted as collateral and recorded within non-trade and notes receivables at June 30, 2022. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion. In July 2022, after consideration of the escrow balance and funds available under the delayed-draw Term Loan Facility, we reduced the aggregate committed principal amount of the bridge credit agreement (the \"Bridge Credit Agreement\") to zero . \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-10, \"Government Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\", which requires entities to provide disclosures on material government assistance transactions for annual reporting periods. The disclosures include information around the nature of the assistance, the related accounting policies used to account for government assistance, the effect of government assistance on the entity&#8217;s financial statements, and any significant terms and conditions of the agreements, including commitments and contingencies. The new guidance is effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021; however, early adoption is permitted. The guidance may be applied either prospectively to all in-scope transactions that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and to new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application, or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect it to be material. \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.\" ASU 2021-08 requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures will depend on the magnitude of future acquisitions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n2. Revenue recognition \n\nRevenue is derived primarily from the sale of products in a variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. A majority of the Company&#8217;s revenues are recognized at a point in time. However, a portion of the Company&#8217;s revenues are recognized over time. \n\nDisaggregation of revenue \n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by technology platforms for the Diversified Industrial Segment, by product platforms for the Aerospace Systems Segment and by geographic location for the total Company. \n\nThe Diversified Industrial Segment is an aggregation of several business units, which manufacture motion-control and fluid power system components for builders and users of various types of manufacturing, packaging, processing, transportation, agricultural, construction, and military vehicles and equipment. Contracts consist of individual purchase orders for standard product, blanket purchase orders and production contracts. Blanket purchase orders are often associated with individual purchase orders and have terms and conditions which are subject to a master supply or distributor agreement. Individual production contracts, some of which may include multiple performance obligations, are typically for products manufactured to the customer's specifications. Revenue in the Diversified Industrial Segment is typically recognized at the time of product shipment, but a portion of revenue may be recognized over time for installation services or in situations where the product has no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment. \n\nDiversified Industrial Segment revenues by technology platform: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Motion Systems $ 3,489,431 &#160; $ 3,081,366 &#160; Flow and Process Control 4,616,270 &#160; 4,108,080 &#160; Filtration and Engineered Materials 5,236,345 &#160; 4,770,713 &#160; Total $ 13,342,046 &#160; $ 11,960,159 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nThe Aerospace Systems Segment produces hydraulic, fuel, pneumatic and electro-mechanical systems and components, which are utilized on virtually every domestic commercial, military and general aviation aircraft. Aerospace Systems Segment products also perform a vital role in naval vessels and land-based weapon systems. Contracts generally consist of blanket purchase orders and individual long-term production contracts. Blanket purchase orders, which have terms and conditions subject to long-term supply agreements, are typically associated with individual purchase orders. Revenue in the Aerospace Systems Segment is typically recognized at the time of product shipment, but a portion of revenue may be recognized over time in situations where the customer controls the asset as it is produced or the product has no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment. \n\nAerospace Systems Segment revenues by product platform: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Flight Control Actuation $ 761,215 &#160; $ 698,877 &#160; Fuel and Inerting 535,292 &#160; 509,687 &#160; Hydraulics 306,279 &#160; 308,835 &#160; Engines 591,513 &#160; 575,804 &#160; Fluid Conveyance 219,543 &#160; 196,348 &#160; Other 105,720 &#160; 97,930 &#160; Total $ 2,519,562 &#160; $ 2,387,481 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTotal revenues by geographic region based on the Company's selling operation's location: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 North America $ 10,216,292 &#160; $ 9,046,162 &#160; Europe 3,156,024 &#160; 2,919,025 &#160; Asia Pacific 2,290,557 &#160; 2,215,686 &#160; Latin America 198,735 &#160; 166,767 &#160; Total $ 15,861,608 &#160; $ 14,347,640 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe majority of revenues from the Aerospace Systems Segment is generated from sales to customers within North America. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nContract balances \n\nContract assets and contract liabilities are reported on a contract-by-contract basis. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. Payments from customers are received based on the terms established in the contract with the customer. \n\nTotal contract assets and contract liabilities are as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Contract assets, current (included within Prepaid expenses and other) $ 28,546 &#160; $ 34,190 &#160; Contract assets, noncurrent (included within Investments and other assets) 794 &#160; 1,884 &#160; Total contract assets 29,340 &#160; 36,074 &#160; Contract liabilities, current (included within Other accrued liabilities) ( 60,472 ) ( 51,211 ) Contract liabilities, noncurrent (included within Other liabilities) ( 2,225 ) ( 3,080 ) Total contract liabilities ( 62,697 ) ( 54,291 ) Net contract liabilities $ ( 33,357 ) $ ( 18,217 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nNet contract liabilities at June 30, 2022 increased from the prior year amount due to both an increase in contract liabilities related to the receipt of advance payments and a decrease in contract assets resulting from customer billings. During 2022, approximately $ 44 million of revenue was recognized that was included in the contract liabilities at June 30, 2021. \n\nRemaining performance obligation s \n\nOur backlog represents written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release has been agreed to with the customer. We believe our backlog represents our unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. Backlog at June 30, 2022 was $ 7,850 million, of which approximately 88 percent is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months and the balance thereafter. \n\n3. Acquisitions \n\nProposed Acquisition \n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt plc (\"Meggitt\") for 800 pence per share (the \"Acquisition\"), which is approximately &#163; 6,263 million based on issued share capital at July 31, 2022. \n\nMeggitt is a leader in design, manufacturing and aftermarket support of technologically differentiated systems and equipment in aerospace, defense and selected energy markets with annual sales of approximately $ 2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. We intend to fund the proposed Acquisition with cash resources, borrowings under debt facilities and net proceeds of debt securities. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion. The proposed Acquisition received the European Commission's clearance on April 11, 2022, conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by the Company, including a commitment to divest its aircraft wheel and brake business within the Aerospace Systems Segment. The proposed Acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearance. Acquisition-related transaction costs totaled $ 44 million in 2022. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nOn May 23, 2022, the Company signed an agreement to divest its aircraft wheel and brake business, within the Aerospace Systems Segment. The aggregate carrying amount of the assets held for sale as of June 30, 2022 was $ 66 million. These assets primarily include goodwill and inventory and are recorded within prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Closing of this divestiture is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearance. \n\nRestricted Cash \n\nDuring 2022 we deposited funds, comprised of cash on hand and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the Senior Notes, into an escrow account. The escrow account is restricted to payments for the proposed Acquisition. At June 30, 2022, the balance was $ 6,112 million, which was recorded within prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAcquisitions \n\nOn October 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 100 percent equity interest in LORD Corporation (\"Lord\") for approximately $ 3,455 million in cash, including the assumption of debt. On September 16, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 100 percent equity interest in EMFCO Holdings Incorporated, parent company of Exotic Metals Forming Company LLC (\"Exotic\") for approximately $ 1,706 million in cash. \n\nLord is a diversified technology and manufacturing company developing highly reliable adhesives and coatings, as well as vibration and motion control technologies, that significantly reduce risk and improve product performance. Lord&#8217;s products are used in mission-critical applications in the aerospace, automotive and industrial markets. Lord had annual sales of approximately $ 1,025 million for its fiscal 2018. For segment reporting purposes, approximately 95 percent of Lord's sales are included in the Diversified Industrial Segment, while the remaining five percent are included in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Lord&#8217;s unique and proprietary products, solutions and technologies for mission-critical applications are expected to increase the Company's overall engineered materials product and solutions offerings to enable a stronger value proposition for customers. \n\nExotic designs and manufactures innovative and technically demanding, high temperature, high pressure air and exhaust management solutions for aircraft and engines. Exotic had annual sales of approximately $ 409 million for its fiscal 2019. \n\nFor segment reporting purposes, Exotic is included in the Aerospace Systems Segment. We believe Exotic's products and proprietary manufacturing capabilities are complementary to our portfolio of flight control, fuel and inerting, hydraulics, fluid conveyance and engine components. \n\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The process of estimating the fair values of certain tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. The following presents the estimated fair values of Lord's and Exotic's assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the respective acquisition dates. These estimates are based on available information and are revised during the measurement period, not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date, as third-party valuations are finalized, additional information becomes available and as additional analysis is performed. All measurement period adjustments were completed within a year from the acquisition date, and such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe final purchase price allocations for acquisitions in 2020 is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Lord Exotic October 29, 2019 September 16, 2019 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 74,013 &#160; $ 8,179 &#160; Accounts receivable 153,765 &#160; 81,336 &#160; Inventories 248,600 &#160; 114,661 &#160; Prepaid expenses 24,230 &#160; 1,343 &#160; Property, plant and equipment 409,163 &#160; 178,393 &#160; Deferred income taxes &#8212; &#160; 2,057 &#160; Other assets 41,335 &#160; 1,226 &#160; Intangible assets 1,446,660 &#160; 874,470 &#160; Goodwill 1,970,603 &#160; 503,725 &#160; Total assets acquired 4,368,369 &#160; 1,765,390 &#160; Liabilities: Notes payable and long-term debt payable within one year 156 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Accounts payable, trade 56,186 &#160; 23,176 &#160; Accrued payrolls and other compensation 57,571 &#160; 8,863 &#160; Accrued domestic and foreign taxes 2,898 &#160; 2,123 &#160; Other accrued liabilities 88,394 &#160; 25,662 &#160; Long-term debt 221,161 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Pensions and other postretirement benefits 115,017 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Deferred income taxes 304,445 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other liabilities 55,832 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Noncontrolling interests 11,266 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed 912,926 &#160; 59,824 &#160; Net assets acquired $ 3,455,443 &#160; $ 1,705,566 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired. With respect to the Lord and Exotic acquisitions, goodwill represents cost synergies and enhancements to our existing technologies. For tax purposes, Lord's goodwill is not deductible, and Exotic's goodwill is deductible. Based upon an acquisition valuation, intangibles acquired as part of the Exotic acquisition include $ 502 million of customer-related intangible assets, $ 281 million of patents and technology and $ 91 million of trademarks, with weighted average estimated useful lives of 18 , 20 and 20 years, respectively. Similarly, the Lord acquisition includes $ 869 million of customer-related intangible assets, $ 458 million of patents and technology and $ 119 million of trademarks, with weighted average estimated useful lives of 13 , 21 and 20 years, respectively. These intangible assets were valued using the income approach, which includes significant assumptions around future revenue growth and discount rates. Such assumptions are classified as level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. \n\nOur consolidated financial statements for 2020 include the results of operations of Lord and Exotic from their respective acquisition dates through June 30, 2020. Net sales and segment operating income attributable to these acquisitions during this period and included in our consolidated financial statements totaled $ 949 million and $ 22 million, respectively. \n\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs totaled $ 119 million in 2020. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n4. Business Realignment and Acquisition Integration Charges \n\nThe Company incurred business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022, 2021 and 2020. During 2021, business realignment charges primarily consisted of actions taken to address the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Such charges were also incurred in 2020, especially within the Aerospace Systems Segment. In 2022, 2021, and 2020 business realignment charges included severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity as well as plant closures. In 2022 and 2021, a majority of the business realignment charges were incurred in Europe. In 2020, a majority of the business realignment charges were incurred in North America. We believe the realignment actions will positively impact future results of operations but will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital. \n\nBusiness realignment charges by business segment are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Diversified Industrial $ 13,787 &#160; $ 38,557 &#160; $ 52,288 &#160; Aerospace Systems 967 &#160; 6,680 &#160; 22,101 &#160; Corporate administration &#8212; &#160; 1,399 &#160; 1,175 &#160; Other expense 3 &#160; 1,226 &#160; 50 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWorkforce reductions in connection with such business realignment charges by business segment are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Diversified Industrial 300 &#160; 820 &#160; 2,394 &#160; Aerospace Systems 10 &#160; 327 &#160; 1,254 &#160; Corporate administration &#8212; &#160; 20 &#160; 31 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe business realignment charges are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Cost of sales $ 7,821 &#160; $ 33,746 &#160; $ 58,791 &#160; Selling, general and administrative expenses 6,933 &#160; 12,890 &#160; 16,773 &#160; Loss on disposal of assets 3 &#160; 1,226 &#160; 50 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring 2022, approximately $ 21 million in payments were made relating to business realignment charges. Remaining payments related to current-year and prior-year business realignment actions of approximately $ 8 million, a majority of which are expected to be paid by March 31, 2023, are primarily reflected within the other accrued liabilities caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional charges may be recognized in future periods related to the business realignment and acquisition integration actions described above, the timing and amount of which are not known at this time. \n\nIn addition to the business realignment charges discussed above, in 2022, we also incurred $ 20 million of expense as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items and $ 8 million of foreign currency translation expense reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. Within the business segment information in Note 18, $ 7 million of expense was recorded in the other expense (income) caption, while the remainder of the charge was split evenly between the Aerospace Systems Segment and the Diversified Industrial International businesses. \n\nWe also incurred the following acquisition integration charges related to the Lord, Exotic and proposed Meggitt acquisitions: ##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 2020 Diversified Industrial $ 3,589 &#160; $ 11,222 &#160; $ 20,669 &#160; Aerospace Systems 1,177 &#160; 719 &#160; 1,908 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIn 2022, acquisition integration planning charges within the Aerospace Systems segment relate to the proposed Meggitt acquisition. In both 2021 and 2020, acquisition integration charges relate to the acquisitions of Lord and Exotic.

The differences comprising the net deferred taxes shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30 were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Retirement benefits $ 207,147 &#160; $ 322,931 &#160; Other liabilities and reserves 180,624 &#160; 136,710 &#160; Long-term contracts 8,739 &#160; 5,562 &#160; Stock-based compensation 31,490 &#160; 30,165 &#160; Loss carryforwards 888,552 &#160; 861,013 &#160; Unrealized currency exchange gains and losses 254,334 &#160; 18,841 &#160; Inventory 14,649 &#160; ( 11,753 ) Tax credit carryforwards 17,326 &#160; 19,709 &#160; Undistributed foreign earnings ( 21,822 ) ( 21,722 ) Depreciation and amortization ( 875,623 ) ( 945,422 ) Valuation allowance ( 901,875 ) ( 865,764 ) Net deferred tax (liability) $ ( 196,459 ) $ ( 449,730 ) Change in net deferred tax (liability): Provision for deferred tax $ 351,201 &#160; $ 51,500 &#160; Items of other comprehensive (loss) income ( 98,810 ) ( 209,509 ) Acquisitions and other 880 &#160; 291 &#160; Total change in net deferred tax $ 253,271 &#160; $ ( 157,718 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nAs of June 30, 2022, we recorded deferred tax assets of $ 889 million resulting from $ 3,566 million in loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $ 876 million related to the loss carryforwards has been established due to the uncertainty of their realization. Of this valuation allowance, $ 853 million relates to non-operating entities whose loss carryforward utilization is considered to be remote. Some of the loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely; others can be carried forward from three to 20 years. In addition, a valuation allowance of $ 26 million related to other future deductible items has been established due to the uncertainty of their realization. \n\nAlthough future distributions of foreign earnings to the United States should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, other U.S. or foreign taxes may be imposed on such earnings. We have analyzed existing factors and determined we will no longer permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. On these undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $ 678 million that are no longer permanently reinvested outside of the United States, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 13 million. The remaining undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $ 1,630 million remain permanently reinvested outside the United States at June 30, 2022. Of these undistributed earnings, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $ 8 million where certain foreign holding companies are not permanently reinvested in their subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the additional taxes, including applicable foreign withholding taxes, that might be payable on the potential distribution of such permanently reinvested foreign earnings. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Balance July 1 $ 100,759 &#160; $ 86,277 &#160; $ 140,662 &#160; Additions for tax positions related to current year 7,039 &#160; 10,145 &#160; 4,955 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 1,415 &#160; 10,320 &#160; 798 &#160; Additions for acquisitions &#8212; &#160; 2,376 &#160; 43,532 &#160; Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 140 ) ( 1,996 ) ( 41,726 ) Reductions for settlements ( 3,127 ) ( 7,165 ) ( 53,520 ) Reductions for expiration of statute of limitations ( 6,647 ) ( 2,252 ) ( 3,820 ) Effect of foreign currency translation ( 8,630 ) 3,054 &#160; ( 4,604 ) Balance June 30 $ 90,669 &#160; $ 100,759 &#160; $ 86,277 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $ 91 million, $ 101 million and $ 86 million as of June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The accrued interest related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluded from the amounts above, was $ 18 million, $ 18 million and $ 14 million as of June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIt is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to approximately $ 30 million as a result of the revaluation of existing uncertain tax positions arising from developments in the examination process or the closure of tax statutes. Any increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is expected to be insignificant. \n\nWe file income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We are open to assessment of our U.S. federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service for years after 2013, and our state and local income tax returns for years after 2016. We are open to assessment for significant foreign jurisdictions for years after 2011. \n\n6. Earnings Per Share \n\nBasic earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the year. Common share equivalents represent the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards. The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,315,605 &#160; $ 1,746,100 &#160; $ 1,201,970 &#160; Denominator: Basic - weighted-average common shares 128,539,387 &#160; 128,999,879 &#160; 128,418,495 &#160; Increase in weighted-average common shares from dilutive effect of equity-based awards 1,816,556 &#160; 1,834,599 &#160; 1,386,539 &#160; Diluted - weighted-average common shares, assuming exercise of equity-based awards 130,355,943 &#160; 130,834,478 &#160; 129,805,034 &#160; Basic earnings per share $ 10.24 &#160; $ 13.54 &#160; $ 9.36 &#160; Diluted earnings per share $ 10.09 &#160; $ 13.35 &#160; $ 9.26 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nFor 2022, 2021 and 2020, 0.4 million, 0.4 million and 0.6 million common shares, respectively, subject to equity-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n7.

Refer to Note 3 for further discussion. \n\nDivestitures represent goodwill associated with the sale of a business during 2022. \n\nGoodwill reclassified to held for sale, which was allocated using the relative fair value method, relates to the aircraft wheel and brake business. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion. \n\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2022, 2021 and 2020 resulted in no impairment loss being recognized. \n\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line method over their legal or estimated useful lives. The gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major category of intangible asset at June 30 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Patents and technology $ 990,775 &#160; $ 259,587 &#160; $ 999,952 &#160; $ 216,314 &#160; Trademarks 727,820 &#160; 339,244 &#160; 762,130 &#160; 331,905 &#160; Customer lists and other 3,735,042 &#160; 1,718,989 &#160; 3,869,772 &#160; 1,563,838 &#160; Total $ 5,453,637 &#160; $ 2,317,820 &#160; $ 5,631,854 &#160; $ 2,112,057 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal intangible asset amortization expense in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 314 million, $ 325 million and $ 285 million, respectively. Estimated intangible asset amortization expense for the five years ending June 30, 2023 through 2027 is $ 300 million, $ 285 million, $ 278 million, $ 273 million and $ 267 million, respectively. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIntangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition may be less than their net carrying value. No material intangible asset impairments occurred in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \n\n9. Financing Arrangements \n\nDuring 2022, the Company amended its existing multi-currency credit agreement, increasing its capacity to $ 3,000 million, by exercising the accordion feature. As of June 30, 2022, $ 1,578 million was available for borrowing under the credit agreement. The credit agreement expires in September 2024; however, the Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement supports our commercial paper program, and issuances of commercial paper reduce the amount of credit available under the agreement. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which may increase in the event our credit ratings are lowered. Although a lowering of our credit ratings would likely increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit our ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. \n\nThe Company is currently authorized to sell up to $ 3,000 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $ 1,422 million commercial paper notes outstanding at June 30, 2022 and none were outstanding at June 30, 2021. The Company had no outstanding borrowings from foreign banks at June 30, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average interest rate on notes payable during 2022 and 2021 was 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, some of our locations may enter into financial guarantees through financial institutions which enable customers to be reimbursed in the event of nonperformance by the Company. \n\nThe Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. Based on our rating level at June 30, 2022, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. As of June 30, 2022, our debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.57 to 1.0. We are in compliance with all covenants. \n\n10.

Interest payments are due semi-annually. We intend to use the proceeds of the Senior Notes to finance a portion of the purchase of the proposed Acquisition. If the Company does not consummate its proposed acquisition of Meggitt on or prior to April 3, 2023 or, if prior to such date, the Company notifies the trustee in writing that the cooperation agreement between Parker and Meggitt is terminated, the Senior Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. Debt issuance costs, including discounts, related to the Senior Notes totaled $ 33 million and will be amortized over the respective debt terms. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn connection with the proposed acquisition, the Company entered into a Bridge Credit Agreement on August 2, 2021. Under the Bridge Credit Agreement, lenders committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of &#163; 6,524 million at August 2, 2021. As permanent financing for the proposed Acquisition was secured, the principal amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement was reduced. At June 30, 2022, the available aggregate principal amount was &#163; 591 million. Any borrowings made under the Bridge Credit Agreement would mature 364 days from the initial funding date. The commitments are intended to be drawn to finance the proposed acquisition of Meggitt only to the extent that we do not arrange for alternative financing prior to closing. In 2022, we incurred $ 52 million in financing fees related to the Bridge Credit Agreement, all of which was included in other expense (income), net within the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nAdditionally, we entered into a senior, unsecured delayed-draw Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $ 2,000 million on August 27, 2021. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility, if drawn, will be used solely by the Company to finance a portion of the purchase of its proposed Acquisition. \n\nPrincipal amounts of long-term debt payable in the five years ending June 30, 2023 through 2027 are $ 302 million, $ 1,976 million, $ 1,234 million, $ 0.4 million and $ 700 million, respectively. The principal amounts of long-term debt payable exclude the amortization of debt issuance costs. \n\n11. Leases \n\nWe primarily enter into lease agreements for office space, distribution centers, certain manufacturing facilities and equipment. The majority of our leases are operating leases. Finance leases are immaterial to our financial statements. In addition, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain leases contain options that provide us with the ability to extend the lease term. Such options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. When accounting for leases, we combine payments for leased assets, related services and other components of a lease. Payments within certain lease agreements are adjusted periodically for changes in an index or rate. \n\nThe discount rate implicit within our leases is generally not determinable, and therefore we determine the discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate for our leases is determined based on lease term and the currency in which lease payments are made. \n\nThe components of lease expense are as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Operating lease expense $ 46,026 &#160; $ 48,171 &#160; Short-term lease cost 7,041 &#160; 7,674 &#160; Variable lease cost 5,849 &#160; 5,835 &#160; Total lease cost $ 58,916 &#160; $ 61,680 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental cash flow information related to operating leases is as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 45,371 &#160; $ 47,080 &#160; Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 50,925 &#160; 41,637 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Operating lease right-of-use assets (included within Investments and other assets) $ 133,412 &#160; $ 131,880 Current operating lease liabilities (included within Other accrued liabilities) $ 36,023 &#160; $ 40,193 &#160; Long-term operating lease liabilities (included within Other liabilities) 100,337 &#160; 93,904 &#160; Total operating lease liabilities $ 136,360 &#160; $ 134,097 &#160; Weighted average remaining lease term 5.6 years 5.5 years Weighted average discount rate 1.6 &#160; % 1.8 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nMaturities of lease liabilities at June 30, 2022 are as follows: ##TABLE_START Operating Leases 2023 $ 37,876 &#160; 2024 28,584 &#160; 2025 23,299 &#160; 2026 17,721 &#160; 2027 10,633 &#160; Thereafter 25,483 &#160; Total operating lease payments $ 143,596 &#160; Less imputed interest 7,236 &#160; Total operating lease liabilities $ 136,360 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n12. Retirement Benefits \n\nPensions - The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. Plans for most salaried employees provide pay-related benefits based on years of service. Plans for hourly employees generally provide benefits based on flat-dollar amounts and years of service. We also have arrangements for certain key employees, which provide for supplemental retirement benefits. In general, the Company's policy is to fund these plans based on legal requirements, tax considerations, local practices and investment opportunities. We also sponsor defined contribution plans and participate in government-sponsored programs in certain foreign countries. \n\nA summary of the Company's defined benefit pension plans follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Benefit cost Service cost $ 76,638 &#160; $ 84,188 &#160; $ 82,743 &#160; Interest cost 110,250 &#160; 102,475 &#160; 142,479 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 267,888 ) ( 267,579 ) ( 266,674 ) Amortization of prior service cost 4,103 &#160; 5,325 &#160; 5,633 &#160; Amortization of unrecognized actuarial loss 157,288 &#160; 207,897 &#160; 165,815 &#160; Amortization of transition obligation 8 &#160; 18 &#160; 18 &#160; Net periodic benefit cost $ 80,399 &#160; $ 132,324 &#160; $ 130,014 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nComponents of net pension benefit cost, other than service cost, are included in other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 6,323,003 &#160; $ 6,405,623 &#160; Service cost 76,638 &#160; 84,188 &#160; Interest cost 110,250 &#160; 102,475 &#160; Plan amendments ( 5,691 ) 2,311 &#160; Actuarial gain ( 1,097,053 ) ( 91,719 ) Benefits paid ( 256,868 ) ( 264,062 ) Foreign currency translation and other ( 190,960 ) 84,187 &#160; Benefit obligation at end of year $ 4,959,319 &#160; $ 6,323,003 &#160; Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 5,305,577 &#160; $ 4,594,106 &#160; Actual (loss) gain on plan assets ( 605,642 ) 831,762 &#160; Employer contributions 96,717 &#160; 76,936 &#160; Benefits paid ( 256,868 ) ( 264,062 ) Foreign currency translation and other ( 177,631 ) 66,835 &#160; Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 4,362,153 &#160; $ 5,305,577 &#160; Funded status $ ( 597,166 ) $ ( 1,017,426 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Other accrued liabilities $ ( 19,307 ) $ ( 4,944 ) Pensions and other postretirement benefits ( 577,859 ) ( 1,012,482 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 597,166 ) $ ( 1,017,426 ) Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Net actuarial loss $ 672,775 &#160; $ 1,090,343 &#160; Prior service cost 4,901 &#160; 15,006 &#160; Transition obligation &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; Net amount recognized $ 677,676 &#160; $ 1,105,357 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe presentation of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) is on a debit (credit) basis and excludes the effect of income taxes. \n\nAt June 30, 2022, the benefit obligation decreased primarily due to significantly higher discount rates. At June 30, 2021, the benefit obligation decreased primarily due to slightly higher discount rates, partially offset by updated census data and assumptions. \n\nInvestment (losses) gains are the primary contributing factor for the (decrease) increase in plan assets' fair value during 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $ 4,785 million and $ 6,069 million at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nInformation for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Accumulated benefit obligation \n\n$ 4,284,601 &#160; $ 5,358,817 &#160; Fair value of plan assets \n\n3,742,513 &#160; 4,546,301 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nInformation for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation \n\n$ 4,483,486 &#160; $ 5,620,693 &#160; Fair value of plan assets \n\n3,782,688 &#160; 4,568,113 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nWe expect to make cash contributions of approximately $ 76 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2023, the majority of which relates to our non-U.S. plans.

The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on the weighted-average expected return of the various asset classes in the plans' portfolio. The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance. \n\nThe weighted-average allocation of the majority of the assets related to defined benefit plans is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Equity securities 31 &#160; % 38 &#160; % Debt securities 43 &#160; % 41 &#160; % Other investments 26 &#160; % 21 &#160; % 100 &#160; % 100 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe weighted-average target asset allocation as of June 30, 2022 is 40 percent equity securities, 43 percent debt securities and 17 percent other investments. The investment strategy for the Company's worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets focuses on achieving prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable levels of risk in order to provide adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit requirements. This strategy requires investment portfolios that are broadly diversified across various asset classes and external investment managers. Assets held in the U.S. defined benefit plan account for approximately 77 percent of our total defined benefit plan assets. The overall investment strategy with respect to our U.S. defined benefit plan is to use a funding strategy more heavily weighted toward liability-hedging assets as the funded status improves. Over time, we will continue to add long duration fixed income investments to the portfolio. These securities are highly correlated with our pension liabilities and will be managed in a liability framework. \n\nThe fair values of pension plan assets at June 30, 2022 and at June 30, 2021, by asset class, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START June 30, 2022 Quoted Prices In Active Markets &#160;(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs &#160;(Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160;(Level 3) Cash and cash equivalents $ 201,053 &#160; $ 190,616 &#160; $ 10,437 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equity securities U.S. based companies 327,122 &#160; 327,122 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-U.S. based companies 8,700 &#160; 8,700 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income securities Corporate debt securities 380,694 &#160; 1,309 &#160; 379,385 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Government issued securities 87,650 &#160; 55,201 &#160; 32,449 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mutual funds Equity funds 9,085 &#160; 9,085 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income funds 9,679 &#160; 9,679 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mutual funds measured at net asset value 279,849 &#160; Common/Collective trusts measured at net asset value 2,718,445 &#160; Limited Partnerships measured at net asset value 133,026 &#160; Miscellaneous 206,850 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 206,850 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total at June 30, 2022 $ 4,362,153 &#160; $ 601,712 &#160; $ 629,121 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START June 30, 2021 Quoted Prices In Active Markets &#160;(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs &#160;(Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160;(Level 3) Cash and cash equivalents $ 248,525 &#160; $ 241,421 &#160; $ 7,104 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Equity securities U.S. based companies 408,301 &#160; 408,301 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Non-U.S. based companies 12,834 &#160; 12,834 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income securities Corporate debt securities 531,497 &#160; 1,440 &#160; 530,057 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Government issued securities 151,458 &#160; 105,167 &#160; 46,291 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mutual funds Equity funds 6,768 &#160; 6,768 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fixed income funds 6,506 &#160; 6,506 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Mutual funds measured at net asset value 368,340 &#160; Common/Collective trusts Common/Collective trusts measured at net asset value 3,161,683 &#160; Limited Partnerships measured at net asset value 126,606 &#160; Miscellaneous 283,059 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 283,059 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total at June 30, 2021 $ 5,305,577 &#160; $ 782,437 &#160; $ 866,511 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nCash and cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. During 2021, the U.S. defined benefit plan implemented a new liability-hedging initiative that requires the plan to maintain a certain cash balance. At June 30, 2022, this required cash balance totaled approximately $ 33 million. \n\nEquity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. U.S. based companies include Parker stock with a fair value of $ 327 million and $ 408 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFixed income securities are valued using both market observable inputs for similar assets that are traded on an active market and the closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. \n\nMutual funds are valued using the closing market price reported on the active market on which the fund is traded or at net asset value per share and primarily consist of equity and fixed income funds. The equity funds primarily provide exposure to U.S. and international equities, real estate and commodities. The fixed income funds primarily provide exposure to high-yield securities and emerging market fixed income instruments. Mutual funds measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are presented in the tables above to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to total pension plan assets. Redemption of a certain mutual fund is subject to a lock-up period, lasting throughout its duration, scheduled to terminate July 2026. However, this mutual fund may extend its duration up to an additional two years under certain conditions. \n\nCommon/Collective trusts primarily consist of equity, fixed income and real estate funds and are valued using the closing market price reported on the active market on which the fund is traded or at net asset value per share. Common/Collective trust investments can be redeemed without restriction after giving appropriate notice to the issuer. Generally, redemption of the entire investment balance of all common/collective trusts requires no more than a 90 -day notice period. The equity funds provide exposure to large, mid and small cap U.S. equities, international large and small cap equities and emerging market equities. The fixed income funds provide exposure to U.S., international and emerging market debt securities. Common/Collective trusts measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are presented in the tables above to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to total pension plan assets. \n\nLimited Partnerships' interest in venture capital investments are measured at fair value based on net asset value as determined by the respective fund investment. A certain limited partnership investment, for which the lock-up period expired June 30, 2022, is restricted to a maximum redemption of 20 percent of its account balance every six months upon a 90 -day notification period. Limited Partnerships measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are presented in the tables above to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to total pension plan assets. \n\nMiscellaneous primarily includes insurance contracts held in the asset portfolio of the Company's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and net payables for securities purchased but not settled in the asset portfolio of the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Insurance contracts are valued at the present value of future cash flows promised under the terms of the insurance contracts. \n\nThe primary investment objective of equity securities and equity funds, within both the mutual fund and common/collective trust asset class, is to obtain capital appreciation in an amount that at least equals various market-based benchmarks. The primary investment objective of fixed income securities and fixed income funds, within both the mutual fund and common/collective trust asset class, is to provide for a constant stream of income while preserving capital. The primary investment objective of limited partnerships is to achieve capital appreciation through an investment program focused on specialized investment strategies. The primary investment objective of the investments in the miscellaneous category is to provide a stable rate of return over a specified period of time. \n\nEmployee Savings Plan - We sponsor an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") as part of our legacy savings and investment 401(k) plan. The ESOP is available to eligible domestic employees. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company matching contributions were increased, up to a maximum of five percent of eligible compensation from the previous maximum of four percent of eligible compensation. These contributions are recorded as compensation expense. Participants may direct company matching contributions to any investment option within the savings and investment 401(k) plan. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Shares held by ESOP 4,125,214 &#160; 4,497,902 &#160; 5,306,643 &#160; Company matching contributions $ 87,554 &#160; $ 66,249 &#160; $ 69,434 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nIn addition to shares within the ESOP, as of June 30, 2022, employees have elected to invest in 1,223,103 shares of common stock within a company stock fund of the savings and investment 401(k) plan. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe Company has a retirement income account (\"RIA\") within our legacy savings and investment 401(k) plan. We make a cash contribution to the participant's RIA each year and participants do not contribute to the RIA. Prior to January 1, 2021, the amount of the annual contribution was based on the participant's age and years of service. Beginning January 1, 2021, we amended the RIA ensuring most participants receive a flat three percent annual contribution of eligible compensation with some grandfathered participants receiving annual contributions calculated at a higher percent of eligible compensation. Under the amended RIA, no participant will receive less than the flat three percent contribution. The Company recognized $ 57 million, $ 42 million and $ 38 million in expense related to the RIA in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nDuring 2020, we acquired several defined contribution plans comprised of similar company matching contributions and RIA features as our legacy plan. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded additional company matching expense of $ 5 million and $ 4 million, respectively, and additional RIA expense of $ 5 million and $ 7 million, respectively, for these acquired plans. During 2021, these acquired plans were merged into our legacy savings and investment 401(k) plan. \n\nOther Postretirement Benefits - The Company provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and eligible dependents. Most plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The plans are unfunded and pay stated percentages of covered medically necessary expenses incurred by retirees after subtracting payments by Medicare or other providers and after stated deductibles have been met. For most plans, the Company has established cost maximums to more effectively control future medical costs. We have reserved the right to change these benefit plans. \n\nThe Company recognized $ 1 million, $ 1 million and $ 2 million in expense related to other postretirement benefits in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Components of net other postretirement benefit cost, other than service cost, are included in other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 63,739 &#160; $ 72,130 &#160; Service cost 206 &#160; 328 &#160; Interest cost 982 &#160; 983 &#160; Actuarial gain ( 11,220 ) ( 4,139 ) Benefits paid ( 4,831 ) ( 5,563 ) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 48,876 &#160; $ 63,739 &#160; Funded status $ ( 48,876 ) $ ( 63,739 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Other accrued liabilities $ ( 4,971 ) $ ( 5,634 ) Pensions and other postretirement benefits ( 43,905 ) ( 58,105 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 48,876 ) $ ( 63,739 ) Amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Net actuarial gain $ ( 15,154 ) $ ( 4,311 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe presentation of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) is on a debit (credit) basis and is before the effect of income taxes. \n\nThe decrease in the benefit obligation is due to significantly higher discount rates in 2022 and slightly higher discount rates in 2021. Updated census data and actuarial assumptions also contributed to the decrease in both fiscal years. \n\nThe assumptions used to measure the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefit obligations are: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.36 &#160; % 2.14 &#160; % 3.15 &#160; % Current medical cost trend rate (Pre-65 participants) 6.45 &#160; % 6.73 &#160; % 7.09 &#160; % Current medical cost trend rate (Post-65 participants) 6.72 &#160; % 7.03 &#160; % 7.43 &#160; % Ultimate medical cost trend rate 4.50 &#160; % 4.50 &#160; % 4.50 &#160; % Medical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate in year 2029 2028 2028 ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe discount rate assumption used to measure the benefit obligation was 4.26 percent and 2.36 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nEstimated future benefit payments for other postretirement benefits in the five years ending June 30, 2023 through 2027 are $ 5 million, $ 5 million, $ 4 million, $ 4 million and $ 4 million, respectively, and $ 17 million in the aggregate for the five years ending June 30, 2028 through June 30, 2032. \n\nOther - The Company has established nonqualified deferred compensation programs, which permit officers, directors and certain management employees to annually elect to defer a portion of their compensation, on a pre-tax basis, until their retirement. The retirement benefit to be provided is based on the amount of compensation deferred, company matching contributions and earnings on the deferrals. In addition, we maintain a defined contribution nonqualified supplemental executive pension plan in which the Company is the only contributor. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded (income) expense relating to these programs of $( 21 ) million, $ 45 million and $ 6 million, respectively. \n\nThe Company has invested in corporate-owned life insurance policies to assist in meeting the obligations under these programs. The policies are held in a rabbi trust and are recorded as assets of the Company. \n\n13.

On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year. Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares. \n\nThe number of common shares repurchased at the average purchase price follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Shares repurchased 1,281,818 &#160; 331,259 &#160; 818,581 &#160; Average price per share, including commissions $ 296.71 &#160; $ 301.88 &#160; $ 179.29 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n14. Stock Incentive Plans \n\nThe Company's 2016 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (\"2016 SIP\") provides for the granting of share-based incentive awards in the form of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and restricted and unrestricted stock to officers and key employees of the Company. On October 23, 2019, the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2016 SIP increased to 23.8 million shares. At June 30, 2022, 8.4 million common stock shares were available for future issuance. \n\nWe satisfy share-based incentive award obligations by issuing shares of common stock out of treasury, which have been repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program described in Note 13, or through the issuance of previously unissued common stock. \n\nSARs - Upon exercise, SARs entitle the participant to receive shares of common stock equal to the increase in value of the award between the grant date and the exercise date. SARs are exercisable from one to three years after the date of grant and expire no more than 10 years after grant. \n\nThe fair value of each SAR award granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate 0.8 &#160; % 0.4 &#160; % 1.5 &#160; % Expected life of award 5.6 years 5.4 years 5.1 years Expected dividend yield of stock 1.9 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % Expected volatility of stock 35.7 &#160; % 35.2 &#160; % 25.9 &#160; % Weighted-average fair value $ 81.71 &#160; $ 53.92 &#160; $ 31.68 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury yields with a term similar to the expected life of the award . The expected life of the award was derived by referring to actual exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience. The expected dividend yield was based on our historical dividend rate and stock price over a period similar to the expected life of the award. The expected volatility of stock was derived by referring to changes in our historical common stock prices over a time-frame similar to the expected life of the award. \n\nSAR activity during 2022 is as follows (aggregate intrinsic value in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding June 30, 2021 4,148,586 &#160; $ 152.44 &#160; Granted 499,386 &#160; $ 296.00 &#160; Exercised ( 520,602 ) $ 129.32 &#160; Canceled ( 28,226 ) $ 239.22 &#160; Outstanding June 30, 2022 4,099,144 &#160; $ 172.27 &#160; 6.0 years $ 326.8 &#160; Exercisable June 30, 2022 2,886,647 &#160; $ 146.49 &#160; 5.0 years $ 287.4 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nTable of Contents \n\nA summary of the status and changes of shares subject to SAR awards and the related average price per share follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Shares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested June 30, 2021 1,470,829 &#160; $ 43.19 &#160; Granted 499,386 &#160; $ 81.71 &#160; Vested ( 729,492 ) $ 40.16 &#160; Canceled ( 28,226 ) $ 61.81 &#160; Nonvested June 30, 2022 1,212,497 &#160; $ 60.44 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $ 37 million, $ 35 million and $ 26 million, respectively, relating to SAR awards.

Generally, the RSUs granted to employees vest, and the underlying stock is issued ratably, over a three-year graded vesting period. Nonvested RSUs may not be transferred and do not have dividend or voting rights. For each nonvested RSU, recipients are entitled to receive a dividend equivalent, payable in cash or common shares, equal to the cash dividend per share paid to common shareholders. \n\nThe fair value of each RSU award granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.

Financial Instruments \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other investments, accounts receivable and long-term investments, as well as obligations under accounts payable, trade, notes payable and long-term debt. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, trade and notes payable approximate fair value. \n\nMarketable securities and other investments include deposits and equity investments. Deposits are recorded at cost, and equity investments are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net income. \n\nThe carrying value of long-term debt, which excludes the impact of net unamortized debt issuance costs, and estimated fair value of long-term debt at June 30 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Carrying value of long-term debt $ 10,145,077 &#160; $ 6,646,029 &#160; Estimated fair value of long-term debt 9,709,407 &#160; 7,527,268 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of long-term debt is classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \n\nThe Company utilizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges, to manage foreign currency transaction and translation risk. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions, and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s &#8364; 700 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025 have been designated as a hedge of the Company&#8217;s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The translation of the Senior Notes due 2025 into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated. \n\nIn connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into deal-contingent forward contracts during October 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the GBP-denominated purchase price. The deal-contingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of &#163; 6,415 million, and settlement is contingent upon closing the proposed Acquisition. In June 2022, we amended the agreement to include a credit support annex (\"CSA\") which obligated Parker to post $ 250 million of cash collateral recorded within non-trade and notes receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. \n\nThe location and fair value of derivative financial instruments reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Balance Sheet Caption 2022 2021 Net investment hedges Cross-currency swap contracts \n\nInvestments and other assets \n\n$ 21,444 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Cross-currency swap contracts \n\nOther liabilities \n\n&#8212; &#160; 71,798 &#160; Other derivative contracts Forward exchange contracts Non-trade and notes receivable 20,976 &#160; 5,376 &#160; Forward exchange contracts Other accrued liabilities 5,651 &#160; 9,435 &#160; Deal-contingent forward contracts Other accrued liabilities 1,015,426 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Costless collar contracts \n\nNon-trade and notes receivable \n\n351 &#160; 110 &#160; Costless collar contracts \n\nOther accrued liabilities \n\n1,578 &#160; 901 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe cross-currency swap, forward exchange, deal-contingent forward and costless collar contracts are reflected on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has not entered into any master netting arrangements. \n\nThe cross-currency swap contracts have been designated as hedging instruments. The forward exchange, deal-contingent forward and costless collar contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and are considered to be economic hedges of forecasted transactions. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe forward exchange and costless collar contracts are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the cost of sales caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The deal-contingent forward contracts are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the other expense (income), net caption in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \n\nDerivatives designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We assess the effectiveness of the &#8364; 69 million, &#8364; 290 million and &#165; 2,149 million cross-currency swap hedging instruments using the spot method. Under this method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. \n\nNet gains (losses) of $ 56 million, $ 16 million and $( 27 ) million relating to forward exchange contracts were recorded within cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net (losses) of $( 1,015 ) million related to the deal-contingent forward contracts were recorded during 2022. All other gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material. \n\nGains (losses) on derivative and non-derivative financial instruments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows: ##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Cross-currency swap contracts $ 69,992 &#160; $ ( 31,988 ) Foreign currency denominated debt 72,670 &#160; ( 32,882 ) ##TABLE_END \n\nDuring 2022, 2021, and 2020 the periodic interest settlements related to the cross-currency swaps were not material. \n\nA summary of financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: ##TABLE_START June 30, 2022 Quoted Prices In Active Markets &#160;(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs &#160;(Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160;(Level 3) Assets: Equity securities $ 13,038 &#160; $ 13,038 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivatives 42,771 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 42,771 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Liabilities: Derivatives 1,022,655 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1,022,655 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START June 30, 2021 Quoted Prices In Active Markets &#160;(Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs &#160;(Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs &#160;(Level 3) Assets: Equity securities $ 20,517 &#160; $ 20,517 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivatives 5,486 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,486 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Liabilities: Derivatives 82,134 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 82,134 &#160; &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair values of the equity securities are determined using the closing market price reported in the active market in which the fund is traded. \n\nDerivatives consist of forward exchange, deal-contingent forward, costless collar and cross-currency swap contracts, the fair values of which are calculated using market observable inputs including both spot and forward prices for the same underlying currencies. The calculation of fair value of the cross-currency swap contracts also utilizes a present value cash flow model that has been adjusted to reflect the credit risk of either the Company or the counterparty. \n\nThe primary investment objective for all investments is the preservation of principal and liquidity while earning income. \n\nThere are no other financial assets or financial liabilities that are marked to market on a recurring basis. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n17. Contingencies \n\nThe Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings based on product liability claims, workers' compensation claims, employee claims, class action lawsuits, and alleged violations of various environmental laws. We are self-insured in the United States for health care, workers' compensation, general liability and product liability up to predetermined amounts, above which third-party insurance applies. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of these proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. While the outcome of pending proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nEnvironmental - The Company is currently responsible for environmental remediation at various manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a &#8220;potentially responsible party,&#8221; along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites. \n\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had an accrual of $ 16.4 million for environmental matters, which are probable and reasonably estimable. The accrual is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of our liability in proportion to other responsible parties. \n\nOur estimated total liability for environmental matters ranges from a minimum of $ 16.4 million to a maximum of $ 64.9 million. The largest range for any one site is approximately $ 13.4 million. The actual costs we will incur are dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action, negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ability of other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or other third-party recoveries. \n\n18. Business Segment Information \n\nThe Company operates in two reportable business segments: Diversified Industrial and Aerospace Systems. Both segments utilize eight core technologies, including hydraulics, pneumatics, electromechanical, filtration, fluid and gas handling, process control, engineered materials and climate control, to drive superior customer problem solving and value creation. \n\nThe Diversified Industrial Segment is an aggregation of several business units, which manufacture motion-control and fluid power system components for builders and users of various types of manufacturing, packaging, processing, transportation, agricultural, construction, and military vehicles and equipment.

Based on this evaluation, the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. \n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our team members have been working remotely at times. We are continually monitoring and assessing the changing business environment resulting from COVID-19 on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. Management has taken measures to ensure that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting remained effective and were not materially affected during this period. \n\nThere were no changes in the Company&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nManagement's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in &#8220;Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).&#8221; We concluded that based on our assessment, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2022. \n\nDeloitte &#38; Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n"
