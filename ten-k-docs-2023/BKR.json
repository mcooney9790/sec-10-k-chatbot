      "text": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes\", \"the Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. Built on a century of experience and conducting business in over 120 countries, our innovative technologies and services are taking energy forward. The Company was formed in July 2017 from the combination between Baker Hughes Incorporated (\"BHI\") and the oil and gas business (\"GE O&#38;G\") of General Electric Company (\"GE\"). As a result of the combination, substantially all of the business of GE O&#38;G and of BHI was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes Holdings LLC (\"BHH LLC\"). BHH LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC. \n\nOUR VISION &#38; STRATEGY \n\nWith the breadth of our portfolio, leading technology, and unique partnership models, we are positioned to deliver outcome-based solutions across the energy and industrial markets. By integrating health, safety &#38; environment (\"HSE\") into everything we do, we protect our people, our customers, and the environment. \n\nThe oil and gas macroeconomic environment continues to be dynamic. We believe the world&#8217;s reliance on hydrocarbons will not disappear, and oil and gas will continue to remain relevant in meeting global energy demand. At the same time, the transition to new energy sources is accelerating, with governments and society focused on a long-term goal of net-zero emissions while trying to balance the &#8220;energy trilemma&#8221; - energy security, sustainability, and affordability - for at least the foreseeable future. We believe the industry is going through a transformation that requires a change in how we work. Irrespective of commodity prices, our customers are focused on reducing both capital and operating expenditures. Our existing and new customers expect new partnership and commercial models and new technology solutions to deliver sustainable productivity improvements and leverage economies of scale, with a lower carbon footprint. That is why our strategy is focused on improving our core competitiveness and delivering higher-productivity solutions today, while positioning to lead the energy transition while solving the energy trilemma. \n\nOur strategy is based on three key pillars: \n\n&#8226; Transform the core : We are transforming our current business to improve margins and cash flow, which we are achieving through portfolio rationalization, cost improvements, and new business models. \n\n&#8226; Invest for growth: We are driving organic and inorganic growth in high potential segments where we have a strong position, including industrial power and processes, industrial asset management, non-metallics, and chemicals. \n\n&#8226; Position for new energy frontiers: We are making strategic investments to drive lower carbon emissions in the energy and industrial sectors, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage (\"CCUS\"), and clean power solutions. \n\nWe expect to benefit from our strategy in the following ways: \n\n&#8226; Scope and scale: We have a global presence and a broad, diversified portfolio. Our products, services, and expertise serve the upstream, midstream/liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, as well as broader chemical and industrial segments. We deliver through our two operating segments: Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial &#38; Energy Technology (\"IET\") as discussed below under \"Products and Services,\" and each are among the top four providers for the majority of the product lines in the markets they serve. \n\n&#8226; Technology: Our culture is built on a heritage of innovation and invention in research and development, with complementary capabilities. Technology remains a differentiator for us, and a key enabler to drive the efficiency and productivity gains our customers need. We also have a range of technologies that support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. We remain committed to investing in our products and services to maintain our leadership position across our offerings, including $556 million research and development spend and being granted more than 2,200 patents worldwide in 2022. We also made several \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 1 \n\nstrategic acquisitions to strengthen our core technology portfolio, including AccessESP, the BRUSH Power Generation business, Qi2 Elements, and Quest Integrity. \n\n&#8226; Energy transition solutions: We are positioned to support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint with a range of emissions-reduction products and services, which we refer to as \"new energy.\" This includes more efficient power generation and compression technology that reduces carbon emissions, including CCUS, as well as hydrogen technologies. We also have a range of inspection and sensor technologies that can monitor and help reduce flaring and emissions. In 2022, we made strategic investments and acquisitions in emerging energy technologies to advance CCUS, hydrogen, net-zero power and e-fuels with companies such as Mosaic, HIF, NET Power, and Levidian, among others. We also continue to expand our low to zero-carbon solutions capabilities, helping customers to detect, quantify, and reduce emissions more efficiently and accurately, and complementing our existing solutions available today. \n\n&#8226; Digital capabilities: We expect to benefit from the emerging demand for artificial intelligence (\"AI\") based solutions as part of our customers&#8217; digital transformation initiatives. Launched in 2019, our partnership with C3.ai, Inc. (\"C3 AI\") continues to enable us to deliver AI that is faster, easier, and more scalable to drive outcomes for our customers. In addition, we are delivering existing technology and collaborating on new AI applications specific for oil and gas customers. In addition to enhancing our technology portfolio with new AI applications, we are creating a digital element in our core OFSE product lines, helping them to deliver efficiency, predictability, and a better experience for our customers and ourselves. We have also continued to invest in our industrial asset management capabilities in IET, including the acquisition of ARMS Reliability and an investment in Augury, a machine health technology company, to support our customers&#8217; digital transformation programs across industrial end markets. \n\nIn September 2022, we announced a restructuring and reorganization effective October 1, 2022, to create two operating segments focused on different growth profiles and designed to simplify our operations and enhance profitability. These two operating segments are Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment, which integrates our previous segments Oilfield Services and Oilfield Equipment, and Industrial &#38; Energy Technology, which integrates our previous segments Turbomachinery &#38; Process Solutions and Digital Solutions. \n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES \n\nOur two operating segments are organized based on the nature of our markets and customers and consist of similar products and services and growth profiles. We sell to our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line. See discussion below by segment. \n\nOilfield Services &#38; Equipment \n\nThe OFSE segment designs and manufactures products and provides related services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of an asset, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. \n\nThe OFSE segment is organized into four product lines. \n\n&#8226; Well Construction focuses on drilling and includes drilling services (directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, surface logging, and remote operations), drill bits (polycrystalline, roller cone, hybrid, and in-bit sensing), and drilling &#38; completions fluids (emulsion-based fluids, water-based fluids, specialty fluids, drill-in fluids, waste management, and completion fluids). \n\n&#8226; Completions, Intervention, &#38; Measurements encompasses completions (wellbore construction, upper and lower completions, unconventional multistage completions, intelligent production systems, workover systems, and fishing and through-tubing services), pressure pumping (cementing, production enhancement, and coiled tubing and tubular running services), and wireline services (openhole logging services, cased-hole logging services, and perforating and drill stem-testing services). \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 2 \n\n&#8226; Production Solutions spans artificial lift systems (electrical submersible pumping systems, surface pumping systems, rigless deployment systems, and sensors and gauges) and oilfield &#38; industrial chemicals (upstream chemicals, downstream chemicals, and Aquaness wholesale chemicals). \n\n&#8226; Subsea &#38; Surface Pressure Systems includes subsea projects and services (subsea trees, controls, manifolds, wellheads, premium casing connectors, installation and commissioning, repairs and maintenance, well intervention, life-of-field solutions, and plug and abandonment), flexible pipe systems (subsea risers, subsea flowlines and jumpers, onshore reinforced thermoplastic pipe, and rehabilitation), and surface pressure control systems (surface trees and wellheads). \n\nThese product lines are supported by an OFSE digital group, which joins the segment&#8217;s domain expertise with a deep understanding of digital technology to improve operational safety, performance, and sustainability. Reservoir analysis proficiencies are rooted in evaluation technologies, a team of reservoir experts, and software. Together, these capabilities provide customers with a greater understanding of the subsurface, enabling smoother, faster drilling and precise wellbore placement that can lead to improved recovery and project economics. OFSE also provides integrated well services and solutions to plan and execute projects ranging from well construction and production through well abandonment, in addition to integrated services and solutions for the subsea environment. \n\nOFSE customers include large integrated major and super-major oil and natural gas companies; U.S. and international independent oil and natural gas companies; national or state-owned oil companies; engineering, procurement, and construction contractors; geothermal companies; and other oilfield service companies. \n\nOFSE believes that its principal competitive differentiators in the industries and markets it serves are the quality, efficiency, reliability, and availability of its products and services. A continued commitment to service delivery, HSE standards, technical proficiency, and competitive pricing is also a key factor in its success. \n\nOFSE products and services are sold in highly competitive markets, and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices; fluctuations in levels of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets; general economic conditions; foreign currency exchange fluctuations; and governmental regulations. While OFSE may have contracts that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period ranging from two to four years, its services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover pricing of the products and services, along with various limitations on liability, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use OFSE products and services. OFSE competitors include SLB and Halliburton (Well Construction; Completions, Intervention, &#38; Measurements; Production Solutions; Subsea &#38; Surface Pressure Systems); ChampionX (Production Solutions); and TechnipFMC, Aker Solutions, and NOV (Subsea &#38; Surface Pressure Systems). \n\nIndustrial &#38; Energy Technology \n\nThe IET segment combines a broad array of domain expertise, technologies, and services for industrial and energy customers including on-and offshore, LNG, pipeline and gas storage, refining, petrochemical, distributed gas, flow and process control, and industrial segments such as nuclear, aviation, automotive, marine, food and beverage, mining, cement and utilities. Our solutions unlock the ability to transform, transfer, and transport energy efficiently, while capturing and cutting emissions, solving a fundamental challenge behind the energy transition: reducing environmental impact, while maximizing efficiency, productivity, and reliability. \n\nIET is organized into six product lines - Gas Technology Equipmen t and Gas Technology Services , collectively referred to as Gas Technology, and Condition Monitoring, Inspection, Pumps Valves &#38; Gears , and PSI &#38; Controls , collectively referred to as Industrial Technology. \n\nGas Technology is organized into two product lines: \n\n&#8226; Gas Technology Equipment designs, manufactures, tests, and installs gas technology solutions that serve the entire gas value chain including offshore, onshore and unconventional, pipeline, LNG, gas storage, and gas distribution.

PSI &#38; Controls serve a broad range of industries from oil and gas to aviation, automotive, and nuclear. \n\nIn 2022, we created the Climate Technology Solutions (&#8220;CTS&#8221;) and Industrial Asset Management (&#8220;IAM&#8221;) organizations which are now part of the IET segment. We believe the creation of these two groups will help accelerate the speed of commercial development across the IET product lines for solutions-based business models throughout our new energy and industrial asset management offerings. \n\nCTS spans carbon capture, utilization and storage, hydrogen, clean power, and emissions management capabilities to enable energy operators as well as the broader industry, in particular the hard-to-abate sectors, to achieve a reliable, net-zero energy system. CTS is the primary driver of the Company&#8217;s new energy orders. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 4 \n\nIAM combines sophisticated hardware technologies with enterprise-class software as a service (SaaS) products and analytics to connect industrial assets, providing customers with the data, safety and security needed to optimize operations reliably and efficiently. IAM provides customers the technical capabilities to drive enterprise-wide digital transformation of business processes and to focus on better production outcomes along the energy and industrial processes value chain, using sensors, software as a service solutions and inspection services to connect industrial assets to the industrial internet. \n\nIET customers for Gas Technology product lines are upstream, midstream, and downstream, onshore, and offshore, and small to large scale. Midstream and downstream customers include LNG plants, pipelines, storage facilities, refineries, and a wide range of industrial and engineering, procurement and construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) companies. Products and services for the Industrial Technology product lines are primarily sold in a diversified, fragmented arena to a broad range of customers. \n\nIET believes that its principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product range coverage, product technology, efficiency, product reliability and quality, availability, project execution and service capabilities, emissions, and price. IET differentiates itself from competitors with its expertise in technology and project management, local presence, and partnerships, to provide fully integrated equipment and services solutions with state-of-art technology from design and manufacture through to operations. \n\nIET competes across a wide range of industries, including oil and gas, power generation, aerospace, and light and heavy industrials.

Competitors for the remaining IET product lines include Emerson, Honeywell Process Solutions, Olympus, Schneider Electric, and ABB. \n\nCONTRACTS \n\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements. \n\nWe enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer&#8217;s technical specifications with little or no relief available due to changes in circumstances. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers. \n\nWe strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and often that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and surface pollution originating from our equipment while under our control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts. \n\nOur indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract. Applicable law or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nand for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices. \n\nThe Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business. \n\nORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS \n\nRemaining performance obligations, a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract. \n\nWe recognized orders of $26.8 billion, $21.7 billion and $20.7 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $14.1 billion, $11.8 billion, and $12.3 billion and IET orders of $12.7 billion, $9.9 billion, and $8.4 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the remaining performance obligations totaled $27.8 billion and $23.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, OFSE remaining performance obligations totaled $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion, and IET remaining performance obligations totaled $25.3 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. \n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nWe engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as the improvement of existing products, services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We continue to invest across both operating segments in products to enhance safety, develop capability, improve performance, and reduce costs aligned with our operational strategy. Through our Technology Centers we also invest heavily in fundamental technologies such as materials, additive manufacturing, sensing, artificial intelligence/machine learning and other digital technologies such as computer vision, data science, and edge computing. \n\nIn OFSE, we continue to fund a range of formation evaluation capabilities as well as drilling, completions, and production hardware. Also in OFSE, the recent focus has been to expand capability into deeper water, longer offsets and at higher pressures as well as modular designs that allow for simpler and more digitally integrated well and field systems. \n\nIn IET, we continue to invest and develop foundational technologies which will enable our journey for the energy transition. Such technologies include advanced materials, advanced manufacturing technologies, novel process technologies, and digital technologies such as advanced sensing &#38; diagnostics, data sciences, and artificial intelligence. Within Gas Technology, we are focusing on our latest generation of gas turbines for energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint such as our LM9000 TM and Nova LT TM products, as well as Allam Cycle turboexpander, CCUS, and hydrogen and geothermal technologies. Within Industrial Technology, we are investing in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of oil and gas, aerospace, energy, and broader industrial production and operations. This includes our Orbit 60 Bently Nevada product for critical asset monitoring in turbine systems, including wind, hydro, and gas turbines. The IET segment is also enhancing its process and safety valve business bringing new digital applications including analytics to our customers. Investments in Industrial Technology also include technologies to measure, monitor, and minimize carbon emissions, new inspection technologies for nondestructive evaluation of materials and structures as well as solutions for industrial asset management. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \n\nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property (\"IP\") rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our IP rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us. Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by GE and, in some cases, third parties. In particular, we have an IP cross-license agreement with GE that allows both parties to have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize certain IP of the other pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The IP cross-licenses remain in place following GE exiting its ownership position in us. We do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations. \n\nWe follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe that maintenance, protection and enforcement of our patents, trademarks, and related IP rights is central to the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our IP rights against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation worldwide as may be necessary to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete. \n\nSEASONALITY \n\nOur operations can be affected by seasonal events, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below: \n\n&#8226; Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail coastal and offshore drilling, which may impact our operations or our customers&#8217; operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Other adverse weather conditions could include extreme heat in the Middle East during the summer months which may impact our operations or our customers' operations. \n\n&#8226; The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have an impact on activity levels and produce variability throughout the year. \n\n&#8226; Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers&#8217; operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue. \n\n&#8226; Many of our international OFSE customers may increase activity for certain products and services in the fourth quarter as they seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. \n\n&#8226; Our broader IET businesses typically experience higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year. \n\nRAW MATERIALS \n\nWe purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services. The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel, titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components, and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks. Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources, but may be subject to price volatility. Due to COVID-19 and other macro-economic factors, the availability of electronic components has resulted in additional expediting activities, fulfillment challenges, and in some cases price increases. We have also seen price increases for ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other raw materials. Our procurement teams utilize advanced planning and may enter into strategic agreements with our global suppliers to minimize price impacts and other availability challenges. We anticipate some pricing and fulfillment volatility for certain raw materials, components and certain logistics lanes to continue through 2023. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nIn addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers. These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESG\") \n\nEnvironmental \n\nWe believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner. We view ESG as a key lever to transform the performance of our Company and our industry. In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations (\"Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions\") in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the specific recommendations of the United Nations (\"UN\") Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#8217;s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 o C. \n\nWe continue to make progress on emissions reductions. We reported in our 2021 Corporate Responsibility report a 23% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions compared to our 2019 base year. This reduction was primarily due to executing on our net-zero roadmap and the key decarbonization pathways through a combination of energy efficiency initiatives, facility consolidation, increasing electric power consumption from renewable energy sources, and improvements in our vehicle fleet, among other reasons. We will continue to employ a broad range of emissions reduction initiatives across manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy sourcing, and generation. \n\nWe also continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land, water, and air quality. Our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Compact (\"UNGC\") and our commitment to the Ten Principles including human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, as well as the UNGC's Sustainable Development Goals. We have annually renewed our commitment to the UN Global Compact since joining in 2019. \n\nSocial &#38; Human Capital \n\nAt Baker Hughes, our people are central contributors to our purpose of taking energy forward. As an energy technology company with operations around the world, we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we aim to attract the best and most diverse talent to support the energy transition. We strive to be an inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by learning and development opportunities, competitive compensation, benefits, health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 55,000 employees. More than 42,000 of our employees work outside the U.S. in over 85 different countries with more than 150 nationalities represented. This diversity of global perspectives makes our Company stronger, more resilient, and more responsive to our global customers. \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\"DEI\") \n\nWe believe unique ideas and perspectives fuel innovation and our differences make us stronger. We value difference in gender, race, ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, cultural background, religion, veteran status, experience, and thought across the globe. We celebrate the diversity and uniqueness of each employee and believe that everyone has the right to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect. And we know that our commitment to DEI will enable us to continue to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, promote an inclusive culture, expand our supplier diversity, and be a stronger partner to our customers and our community. \n\nAs we continue to prioritize DEI, we are focused on diversifying our workforce, with a particular emphasis on increasing gender representation. In 2022, the percentage of people who identify as women in our workforce, senior leadership positions, and on our Board of Directors, was 19%, 19%, and 33%, respectively. Specific to the U.S., 36% of our employees identify as people of color. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nTo ensure we have access to and support diverse pipelines of talent across the globe while prioritizing development and retention, we have ongoing DEI annual plan meetings with our executive leadership team. These annual meetings hold leadership accountable for integrating DEI into their respective parts of the business. We have corporate memberships with respected nonprofits, such as Ally Energy, Catalyst, Disability:IN, and the Women's Energy Network, which provide partnership and guidance as we continue our efforts in fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. Our talent acquisition efforts as well as our eight global employee resource groups support the engagement and retention of diverse talent. \n\nTalent Acquisition: We have enacted a number of initiatives to support our global goal of increasing the number of diverse employees. We have conducted training on unconscious bias and launched pilot projects on blind resumes and debiasing job descriptions, interview templates, and assessments as well as expanded our talent acquisition focus to include executive search services. \n\nEmployee Resource Groups (\"ERG\"): ERGs consist of employees who have joined together based on shared interests, characteristics, or life experiences. These groups can have a powerful influence on driving change by elevating the conversation and awareness around key issues and engaging with the communities where we operate. In 2022, we further expanded our support of the ERGs in several ways, including the opportunity for ERGs to nominate charitable organizations to receive grants from the Baker Hughes Foundation. These efforts have helped our DEI focus and fostered closer connections between employees in communities around the world. \n\nInclusive Culture: We have several programs and initiatives that cultivate an inclusive culture. The Baker Hughes Global DEI Council, comprised of executives representing our businesses, functions and regions, supports the success of our DEI mission and meets quarterly to review progress and discuss ways in which to continue to advance our efforts. The DEI Community of Practice facilitates sharing best practices across the enterprise. We provide our workforce with tools, resources, and learning opportunities that raise awareness, foster inclusive behaviors, and build cross-cultural competences. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nWe are committed to paying for performance and supporting our employees&#8217; wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of their families, by offering flexible and competitive benefits tailored by location to meet the specific needs of our employees. We regularly assess our total compensation and benefits programs through regular benchmarking with industry peers and local markets. We strive to ensure that our compensation programs are fair and equitable for all employees. Healthcare plans and life insurance are a core benefit of the Company and are provided in most locations. Baker Hughes offers various leaves of absence options for certain quality-of-life needs, including family care. We also continue to assess and provide programs that support our employees' work arrangements such as flexible schedules, compressed work weeks, hybrid work, remote work, and other options. \n\nLearning and Development \n\nLearning and Development is a personal journey at Baker Hughes. We empower our employees to follow their passion for personal knowledge, job related skills, development, and the domain expertise needed for professional and personal growth. In alignment with this, in 2022, we added CORE Strengths and Journey courses to our learning communities catalog for our employees to learn, share and practice with their peers no matter where they are in their career. CORE Strengths adds focus to the critical skills (for example Data Analytics, Project Management, Change Management) that will help transform our organization, and Journey is targeted for our promoted leaders to help them transition to their newly expanded role. Also in 2022, we started offering in-person learning opportunities to compliment the robust virtual learning catalog with workshops, team development, and flagships. In 2021, we launched the community, CORE Values, which is a curated learning space centered around our Baker Hughes Values: Grow, Care, Collaborate &#38; Lead, and the behaviors associated with each value. Each learning community involves e-learning, virtual workshops, and allows participants to lead their own sessions. \n\nOur formal leadership development programs play a pivotal role in attracting, retaining, and developing talent and increasing the pipeline of diverse talent into and within the organization. As an example, Aspire is a two-year rotational leadership program for recent graduates and early-career employees to grow functional and leadership skills through challenging assignments, learning plans, and global cross-functional projects. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nHealth, Safety, Environment, and Wellness \n\nHealth and safety is at the core of our culture as we are committed to doing the right thing to protect our employees, customers, the communities where we live and work, and the environment. We take a risk-based approach with proactive and preventive programs to deliver safe, secure, and sustainable operations. We have established a stringent set of standards which meet or exceed global regulatory requirements. \n\nOur commitment to HSE starts at the highest levels of our Company and is embedded throughout all layers of the organization. We encourage and empower all employees to take an active role in \"owning\" HSE by stopping work when conditions are unsafe and reporting observations, near misses, and stop-work events through open reporting channels. Our teams are required to complete recurring training. We offer more than 230 unique HSE courses including foundational training required for all employees, workplace and job-specific training, and human-performance leadership training for managers. Our ambition is to make every day a Perfect HSE Day&#8212;one without serious injuries, accidents, or harm to the environment. In 2022, we achieved 217 Perfect HSE Days, up 6% versus 2021. \n\nOur commitment to HSE goes beyond safety alone. Occupational health and wellness is a key competency jointly managed within our HSE and HR centers of excellence. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken prudent steps as a company to reduce the risk and spread of the virus. Our top priorities have remained: protecting our employees, maintaining operations, and supporting customers and communities globally. As conditions improved in certain places, we started bringing more employees back to offices and worksites and enabled opportunities for more in-person engagements where it was safe to do so. We continue to monitor the situation and will adapt our protocols as needed to protect our employees and deliver for our customers, in alignment with all associated requirements. \n\nThe importance of physical health, ergonomics, preventative health care, and mental wellness cannot be overstated in promoting a healthy, engaged, and productive workplace. We work with our health benefit providers and internal teams to offer employees health and wellness programs, telemedicine access, health screenings, immunizations, fitness reimbursements, and virtual wellness tools. \n\nIn 2022, the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees continued to be a critical priority. We hosted numerous events with Baker Hughes leaders and external experts, further embedded mental well-being into leadership engagements, and provided resources and tools to employees. Our Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") helps employees navigate daily life to manage remote work, cope with major life events or deal with a global pandemic. The EAP gives employees and their family members direct access to professional coaches for in-the-moment counseling or referrals to community experts and extended care providers. \n\nCommunity Involvement \n\nBaker Hughes seeks to make a positive impact in the communities where we conduct business around the world. Consistent with our purpose and values, we work to advance environmental quality, educational opportunities, health, and wellness. We benefit our communities through financial contributions, in-kind donations of goods and services, and volunteer projects. The Baker Hughes Foundation makes strategic philanthropic contributions, matches Baker Hughes employee charitable contributions, and awards volunteer recognition grants for outstanding employee community service. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (\"the Board\") believes the purpose of corporate governance is to maximize shareholder value in a manner consistent with legal requirements and the highest standards of integrity. The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices, which the Board and management believe promote this purpose, are sound, and represent best practices. The Board periodically reviews these governance practices, Delaware law (the state in which the Company is incorporated), the rules and listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities. \n\nOur Board monitors and provides oversight over our ESG policies, programs, and practices regarding corporate responsibility and sustainability and plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management efforts. Our Human Capital and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our social strategy, policies, programs, and \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 10 \n\ninitiatives focusing on DEI as well as pay equity, culture, talent development, succession planning, and executive compensation and benefits. Our Governance &#38; Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the Company's environmental matters, including monitoring its sustainability strategy and initiatives and the management of employee health, safety, and wellness matters. The Audit Committee provides oversight over the Company&#8217;s risk assessment and risk management policies and processes, including data privacy, ethics, and compliance reporting. \n\nGOVERNMENTAL REGULATION \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nWe are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations concerning, among other things, air and water quality, waste management, and land protection. Environmental regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly. \n\nWhile we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business, we are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties, typically related to historical operations. On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred. \n\nThe U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as \"Superfund\") imposes liability for the release of a \"hazardous substance\" into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") at various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share, if known, of the estimated remediation costs for the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs. \n\nIn some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is not yet available. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $63 million and $67 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our environmental assurance programs. \n\nOther Regulatory Matters \n\nWe are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which our products are manufactured or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, safety, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising, and marketing of our products. Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the import and export of goods as well as the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries. In particular, the shipment of goods, services and technology \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nacross international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. We are also required to be in compliance with transfer pricing, securities laws, and other statutes and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other countries&#8217; anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes. \n\nAs a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February of 2022, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries enacted sanctions against Russia and certain Russian interests. As previously announced on March 19, 2022, we suspended any new investments in our Russia operations, but continued to comply with applicable laws and regulations as we fulfilled current contractual obligations. Over the course of the second quarter of 2022, we closely monitored the developments in Ukraine and Russia and changes to sanctions all of which continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging. As a result, we completed a number of actions during the course of 2022 including the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business and suspended substantially all of our remaining operational activities in Russia. For further information see \"Note 20. Restructuring, Impairment and Other\" and \"Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. \n\nWe are also subject to laws relating to data privacy and security and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments worldwide have established laws and regulations, and industry groups also have promoted various standards, regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We are also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices. \n\nWhile there are no current regulatory matters that we expect to be material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other laws, regulations and standards applicable to our operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS \n\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\"), are made available free of charge on our internet website at www.bakerhughes.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, and can be found at their internet website www.sec.gov .

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks. When considering an investment in the Company, one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below, as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and matters not listed below, that we are unaware of, or that we currently consider immaterial. Any of these may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, thus, the value of an investment in the Company. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISKS \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Our investments in new technologies, equipment, and facilities may not provide competitive returns. \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment. Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. In order to be competitive, we must provide new and differentiating technologies, reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers. \n\nWe continue to invest in new technologies, equipment, and facilities. Our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry&#8217;s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors&#8217; products and services. Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive and innovative technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, or as a result of the energy transition to lower carbon emitting technology, or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services, any competitive advantage that we may hold, and in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. \n\nFailure to effectively and timely execute our energy transition strategy could have an adverse effect on the demand for our technologies and services. \n\nOur future success may depend upon our ability to effectively execute on our energy transition strategy. Our strategy depends on our ability to develop additional innovative technologies and work with our customers and partners to advance new energy solutions such as carbon capture utilization and storage, hydrogen energy, geothermal, and other integrated solutions. If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or faster than we can transition or if we fail to execute our energy transition strategy as planned, demand for our technologies and services or access to credit could be adversely affected. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nThe implementation of our plan to restructure our corporate organization and operating segments may not achieve the results we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nIn the second half of 2022, we announced a plan to undertake certain corporate realignments and restructure our four operating segments to focus on two operating segments, OFSE and IET, in order to simplify and streamline our organizational structure, and create better flexibility and economies of scale across the two operating segments. These restructuring activities may be more costly than anticipated, and could lead to the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business priorities. As a result of these or any other factors, we may not realize the anticipated benefits associated with the restructuring plan. There can be no assurance that the restructuring plan will result in cost savings or will materially increase our profitability. Even if the restructuring plan generates the benefits that we have anticipated, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that occur as a result of the restructuring, which could adversely affect our business. \n\nDisruptions in our supply chain, the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, equipment, and supplies essential to our business could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis. \n\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity, including labor, available to meet our manufacturing plans on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories. Disruptions within our supply chain resulting from factors including, but not limited to, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and shortages in labor supply, have had and may continue to have an impact on our business and reputation. As a result of these or any other factors, our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs, and avoid shortages or over-supply of raw materials and component parts, could be adversely affected. \n\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our operations could be adversely affected. \n\nOur operations and future success depend on our ability to recruit, train, and retain key personnel. People are a key resource to developing, manufacturing, and delivering our products and providing technical services to our customers around the world. A competent, well-trained, highly skilled, motivated, and diverse workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key employees, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base, could have an adverse impact on our business performance, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change as we restructure the Company, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company, and motivation and retention of key employees is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals. Other factors that have and could continue to impact our workforce is changes to our office environments, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely which may not meet the expectations of our employees. \n\nOur business could be impacted by both geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict, in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest and/or government expropriations. \n\nGeopolitical and terrorism threats continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business. Geopolitical and terrorism threats, including armed conflict among countries, has had and could in the future lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, adverse impact to our employees, and impairment of our or our customers&#8217; ability to conduct operations. \n\nFurther, the broader consequences of geopolitical and terrorism threats, which may include further sanctions that prohibit our ability to do business in specific countries, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, the potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigation, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and the extent of any such threats effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nCertain geopolitical conflicts, such as between Russia and Ukraine, have had and may continue to have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in our public filings, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions; increased volatility in the price and demand of oil and natural gas, increased exposure to cyber attacks; limitations in our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; risks to employees and contractors that we have in the region; disruptions in global supply chains; exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; potential nationalizations and assets seizures; constraints or disruption in the capital markets and our sources of liquidity; our potential inability to service our remaining performance obligations and potential contractual breaches and litigation. \n\nControl of oil and natural gas reserves by national oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations . \n\nMuch of the world&#8217;s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by national oil companies. National oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with national oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms. \n\nOur operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses. \n\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers&#8217; costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries, such as the offshore oilfield business. These hazards include blowouts, explosions, unplanned or uncontrolled releases, nuclear-related events, fires, collisions, capsizings, and severe weather conditions. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. Our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event, against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe potential physical or transition risks posed by climate change could adversely affect our operations and those of our customers. \n\nThere is increasing concern over risks posed by climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of significant weather events (e.g. flooding, hurricanes and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g. drought, desertification, or poor water quality). Such effects have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results, particularly at facilities in coastal areas or areas prone to chronic water scarcity, and could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, including through direct damage to physical assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. While we evaluate and incorporate potential ranges of physical risks, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also &#8220;Seasonal and weather conditions, including severe weather associated with climate change, could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.&#8221; \n\nAdditionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will likely require extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes. There is increased focus by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability, and energy transition matters. Negative attitudes toward or perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to implement initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 16 \n\nSeasonal and weather conditions, including severe weather associated with climate change, could adversely affect demand for our services and operations. \n\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers&#8217; operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. For example, extreme winter conditions in Canada or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers&#8217; operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue. Repercussions of severe or unseasonable weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may include evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; weather-related damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of operations; weather-related damage to our facilities and project work sites; inability to deliver materials to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; decreases in demand for oil and natural gas during unseasonably warm winters; and loss of productivity. As a result of the above repercussions or any others, demand for our services and operations may be adversely affected. \n\nThe partial or complete loss of GE as a customer or supplier, as well as contracts with our aeroderivative joint venture (the &#8220;Aero JV&#8221;) with GE may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe currently have an extensive commercial relationship with GE. Although we have a long-term contractual framework in place with GE, if GE were to discontinue or reduce its business with the Company, fail to perform its obligations under existing contracts or experience significant disruptions, including under the intellectual property related agreements with GE, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition to our contracts and arrangements with GE as a direct customer and supplier, we and GE formed the Aero JV in 2019. The Aero JV is jointly controlled by GE and us, and as a result, realizing the benefits of this joint venture depends on the continued cooperation between the parties. In addition, the business and financial performance of the Aero JV may be adversely affected if GE were to fail to perform its obligations under its contracts with the Aero JV. We in turn use certain products purchased through the Aero JV for the manufacture of various end products, and therefore, failure of the Aero JV to perform for any reason could prevent us from fulfilling our contractual obligations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nOur business has and may continue to be adversely affected by a public health emergency or outbreak of a contagious disease or virus, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nIn the past, the markets have experienced volatility in oil demand due to the economic impacts of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. If demand for our products and services decline as a result of a public health emergency, the utilization of our assets and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services could decline. The continued spread of COVID-19 or a similar pandemic could result in further instability in the markets and decreases in commodity prices resulting in further adverse impacts on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nIn addition, the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19 and measures to contain the disease may adversely impact our workforce and operations, operations of our customers, and those of our vendors and suppliers. The extent to which these public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may continue to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending on the severity and duration of the emergency and effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such containment or mitigation measures and potential future measures which may result in labor disruptions, employee attrition, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 17 \n\nCREDIT AND CUSTOMER CONTRACTING RISKS \n\nProviding services on an integrated, turnkey, or fixed price basis could require us to assume additional risks. \n\nWe may choose to enter into integrated or turnkey contracts with our customers that require us to provide services and equipment outside of our core business. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may also subject us to additional risks, such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling operations, project management interface risk, and risks associated with subcontracting and consortium arrangements. These integrated or turnkey contracts may be fixed price contracts that do not allow us to recover for cost over-runs unless they are directly caused by the customer. \n\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements. \n\nOur products are used in deepwater, and other harsh environments, and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. In addition, scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications. We cannot provide assurance that our products, including products supplied through joint ventures, will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects, which could impose additional costs and obligations on us. \n\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes. \n\nOur contracts may be terminated early in certain circumstances. \n\nOur contracts with customers generally may be terminated by the customer for convenience, default, or extended force majeure (which could include inability to perform due to COVID-19 or a similar pandemic). Termination for convenience may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer, but the early termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Termination by the customer for default or extended force majeure due to events outside of our control generally will not require the customer to pay an early termination fee. \n\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our customers terminate some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if payments due under our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated. Our remaining performance obligation (\"RPO\") is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services). The actual amount and timing of revenues earned may be substantially different than the reported RPO. The total dollar amount of the Company&#8217;s RPO as of December 31, 2022 was $27.8 billion. \n\nThe credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses. \n\nHaving a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers. Furthermore, countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 18 \n\nmay in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices, which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries, particularly national oil companies. Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers, we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less, or none, of the amounts owed to us by such customer. \n\nOur customers&#8217; activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets. \n\nOur customers&#8217; access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices, required investments, and resulting returns. Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow. In addition, a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for credit losses. \n\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS \n\nCompliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. \n\nWe conduct business in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. In particular, the shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. \n\nCompliance-related issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings or result in investigations leading to fines, penalties or other remedial measures. Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations, and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate. In addition, changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws, rules, and regulations that affect our operations. Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. The continued success of our global business and operations depends, in part, on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political, legal and regulatory risks. \n\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations. \n\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and various other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to successfully manage our agents, distributors and other business partners, and supervise, train, and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, fines and penalties, as well as legal expenses and reputational harm in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 19 \n\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have adverse consequences for us. \n\nNon-compliance with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing and various other financial laws may subject us to sanctions, civil and criminal prosecution, fines and penalties, as well as legal expenses and potential reputational harm. We cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations. \n\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities, and tax audits could impact operating results. \n\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, changes in interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. \n\nWe could be subject to litigation claims arising out of our products and services which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks and we are from time to time subject to litigation in the U.S. and in foreign countries, for example claims involving services or equipment such as personal injury or loss of life, product failure (including as a result of a cyber attack) or damage to or destruction of property, employment and labor, customer privacy, or regulatory risks. While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, our insurance may not cover all expenses related to litigation claims arising from our business. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. We may therefore incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nWe may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights. \n\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nCompliance with, and rulings and litigation in connection with, environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our operations may adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\nWe and our business are subject to extensive domestic and international environmental and safety regulations. In addition to environmental and safety regulatory compliance obligations, we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury, property damage, and human health risks due to exposure of hazardous substances or processes at our current or former facilities. We may be impacted by material changes in environmental and safety regulations or subject to substantial liability for environmental impacts. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and associated expenditures, including but not limited to our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, are forecasted and may be inconsistent based on multiple variables. Our compliance cost forecasts may be substantially different from actual results, which may be affected by factors such as: changes in law that impose restrictions on air or other emissions, wastewater management, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, or wetland and land use practices; changes in standards of enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected, adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party, and may include Superfund sites; the discovery of other sites, or discovery of additional issues at existing sites, where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations; and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nInvestor and public perception related to the Company&#8217;s environment, social, and governance (\"ESG\") performance as well as current and future ESG reporting requirements may affect our business and our operating results. \n\nIncreasing focus on ESG factors has led to enhanced interest in, and review of performance results by investors and other stakeholders, and the potential for litigation and reputational risk. We are committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance and report under standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\"), and recommendations issued by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\"). Our voluntary disclosures of ESG data are evaluated and rated by various organizations that assess corporate ESG performance. Over the past few years there has also been increased investor demand for ESG investing opportunities, and the ESG ratings are used by some stakeholders to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or our inability to meet the ESG standards set by specific investors, may lead to unfavorable sentiment toward Baker Hughes, which could have a negative impact, among other things, on our stock price and cost of capital. \n\nRegulatory requirements related to ESG or sustainability reporting have been adopted in the EU that apply to financial market participants. In the U.S., such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in California, and for the responsible investment of public funds in Illinois. Additional regulation is pending at the SEC and in other states. We expect regulatory requirements related to ESG matters to continue to expand globally. We may be affected by our ability to meet evolving and expanding emissions reporting requirements and by investor and public perception of our reporting and performance related to voluntary climate standards. \n\nTo achieve our stated emission reduction goals, we have implemented internal decarbonization projects and may also need to rely on external factors, such as the greater deployment of carbon reduction and removal technologies and adoption of government policies that we expect would accelerate the adoption of energy transition technologies. There have been policy responses to support the energy transition in the U.S. with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, the 2022 energy disruptions have increased energy prices and raised energy security concerns, which may force many governments to reassess energy transition strategies, extending the timeline to ensure adequate and reasonably priced energy supplies. It is difficult to predict with certainty how these policy, economic, and energy security issues will impact the energy transition. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our reductions and elimination of carbon equivalent emissions commitments within the timelines we announce could have a negative impact on investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating our approach to ESG matters, our stock price and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts. \n\nInternational, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on reducing greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions. Compliance with GHG emission regulations applicable to our or our customers' operations may have significant implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the fossil-fuel sectors. \n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the U.S. Clean Air Act (\"CAA\") of 1970, as amended. The EPA&#8217;s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from, among others, certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry, which in turn may include data from our equipment or operations. In addition, the U.S. government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for, or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from, the oil and natural gas industry. International developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol by the signatories; the Glasgow Climate Pact; the European Union Emission Trading System; Article 8 of the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (\"SECR\"); the EU's proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (\"CBAM\"). Caps or fees on carbon emissions, including in the U.S., have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil-fuel sectors. The implementation of these agreements and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions or impose taxes on us or our customers, all of which could have a material effect on our results of operations. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nVoluntary initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, as well as increased climate change awareness, may result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas. \n\nThere are various corporate and non-governmental initiatives that are focused on voluntary reductions of GHG emissions. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may shift demand from oil and natural gas towards an investment in relatively lower carbon emitting energy sources and alternative energy solutions. If, for example, new energy sources become more competitive than oil and natural gas globally, it could have a material effect on our results of operations. \n\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws or regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy or security, may adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\nWe may have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is or may become subject to various data privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, contractual obligations or customer-imposed controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\nIn the U.S., various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws, regulations and standards concerning personal information, privacy and data security. Internationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information or other data. These various and evolving federal, state and international laws, regulations and standards can differ significantly from one another and, given our global footprint, this may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs, such as costs related to organizational changes and implementing additional protection technologies, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, compliance with applicable requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or international laws, regulations, standards, or contractual or other obligations, relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies, customers or individuals, which could subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. \n\nTECHNOLOGY RISKS \n\nAn inability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business. \n\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate. Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. The weakening of protection of our trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business. \n\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business. Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized. Without protection for the intellectual property rights we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products. Also, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nterms. We would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property. \n\nIncreased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents, pose risks to our systems, data and business, and our relationships with customers and other third parties. \n\nIn the course of conducting our business, we may hold or have access to sensitive, confidential, proprietary or personal data or information belonging to us, our employees or third parties, including customers, partners or suppliers. Increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents, pose risks to our and our customers&#8217;, partners&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; and third-party service providers&#8217; systems, data, and business, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our and our employees&#8217; and customers&#8217; data. We utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate our exposure including the engagement of third party security experts for risk assessments and program enhancements, including ransomware vulnerability assessments, cybersecurity tabletop exercises, and internal phishing awareness campaigns. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to cyber attacks and other security incidents, including ransomware incidents. Given our global footprint, the large number of customers, partners, suppliers and service providers with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period without detection. Any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident would be inherently unpredictable and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack or other security incident. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any cyber attacks and other security incidents. As cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nIn addition to our own systems, we use third-party service providers, who in turn may also use third-party providers, to process certain data or information on our behalf. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers to the extent affecting information we share with them. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and maintain reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. \n\nDespite our and our service providers&#8217; efforts to protect our data and information, we and our service providers have been and may in the future be vulnerable to security breaches, ransomware attacks, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, employee errors and/or malfeasance or similar events, including those perpetrated by criminals or nation-state actors, that could potentially lead to the compromise, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of data or information, improper use of our systems, defective products, loss of access to our data, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber attack or any other significant compromise or breach of our data security, media reports about such an incident, whether accurate or not, or, under certain circumstances, our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement agencies or affected individuals following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols, could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, harm to our relationships with customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties, distraction to our management, remediation or increased protection costs, significant litigation or regulatory action, fines and penalties. Given the increased prevalence of customer-imposed cybersecurity controls and other related contractual obligations towards customers or other third parties, a cyber attack or other security incident also could result in breach of contract or indemnity claims against us by customers or other counterparties. \n\nWhile we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity breaches or attacks, failures or other data security-related incidents, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nassertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nINDUSTRY AND MARKET RISKS \n\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services. \n\nPrices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis. As a result, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers&#8217; activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels. \n\nDemand for our products and services is subject to factors beyond our control and depends substantially on expenditures by our customers. Changes in the global economy could impact our customers&#8217; spending levels and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nDemand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth and substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. Across our products and services, customer demand may be reduced due to global economic factors beyond our control, including but not limited to inflation, rising interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and declining availability of credit. Specifically, for example, past oil and natural gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which in the past has resulted, and may in the future result, in a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices that may require us to record asset impairments, and we could experience decreased revenue, decreased profitability and reduction in cash flows. Such potential impairment charges and adverse operating metrics could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results. \n\nProductive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers&#8217; decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. \n\nCurrency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results. \n\nFluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business and create volatility, as well as the costs of doing business of our customers. \n\nChanges in economic and/or market conditions may impact our ability to borrow and/or cost of borrowing. \n\nThe condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general may affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing, if necessary. If our credit rating is downgraded, it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs, as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining, or make it more difficult to renew, obtain, or issue new debt financing. \n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK \n\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders. \n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, our shareholders may be unable to sell their shares of our Class A common stock at or above their purchase price, if at all. We cannot assure our shareholders that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nfuture. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include: variations in our quarterly operating results; failure to meet our earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or our industry; additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; actions by shareholders; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; adverse publicity about our industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; and general market and economic conditions. \n\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that might be considered favorable. \n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable by permitting our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations, and placing limitations on convening shareholder meetings. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals, delay, or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. \n\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. \n\nPursuant to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The forum selection clause in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. \n\nThis exclusive forum provision applies to certain state law claims and will not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. In addition, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&#38;A\") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein. \n\nWe are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our two business segments: Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial &#38; Energy Technology (\"IET\"). We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nBaker Hughes was successful in 2022, with key commercial successes and solid margin improvements in OFSE. Commercially in IET, orders performance in LNG and new energy hit new highs and are poised to remain strong into 2023. In 2022, we had a record year for LNG equipment orders, and achieved significant growth in new energy orders compared to 2021. Within OFSE, Subsea &#38; Surface Pressure Systems also achieved a strong orders year compared to 2021. \n\nOperationally, our performance for 2022 was mixed. During the year, we experienced several operational challenges across our organization most notably cost inflation, supply chain delays, impact of foreign exchange, and the suspension of our activities in Russia. Our performance improved over the second half of 2022 as supply chain challenges moderated, we saw increased activity primarily in OFSE, and we were able to achieve price improvements that collectively more than offset these operational challenges. \n\nIn 2022, we generated revenue of $21.2 billion, compared to $20.5 billion in 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher volume in OFSE. Operating income in 2022 was $1,185 million compared to $1,310 million in 2021. The decrease in operating income was driven by higher restructuring, impairment and other charges, partially offset by higher segment operating income in OFSE. Income before income taxes was $22 million in 2022, and included other non-operating losses of $911 million and net interest expense of $252 million. Included in our other non-operating loss was a $451 million loss from the sale of part of the OFSE Russia business, and $265 million of unrealized net losses from marking our investments in ADNOC Drilling and C3 AI to fair value. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we announced a reorganization of the Company to create two operating segments, OFSE and IET. This has kicked off a major transformation effort across the organization, including key management changes, which will fundamentally improve the way the Company operates. This reorganization is designed to simplify and streamline our organizational structure, and create better flexibility and economies of scale across the two operating segments. For OFSE, one area of focus will be right sizing OFSE through facility rationalization, removing management layers, and integrating multiple functions and capabilities. For IET, we expect commercial and technological benefits from closer integration as well as the benefit of cost out programs. We expect these changes to improve the long-term optionality and growth opportunities for Baker Hughes as our markets and customers continue to evolve. \n\nBaker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. We increased our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2022 by one cent to $0.19 per share. For the full year of 2022, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest in the Baker Hughes portfolio through strategic acquisitions and early-stage new energy investments. In 2022, we made several strategic acquisitions that will complement our current portfolio. Such acquisitions include the Power Generation division of BRUSH Group (&#8220;BRUSH&#8221;). BRUSH is an established equipment manufacturer that specializes in electric power generation and management for the industrial and energy sectors, which will complement the IET existing portfolio. Other transactions include the acquisitions of Quest Integrity, which will enhance our inspection capabilities, and AccessESP, which broadens our electrical submersible pump (\"ESP\") technology portfolio. New energy investments include Mosaic Materials and NET Power. In 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire Altus Intervention, a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhole technology, which will enhance OFSE's existing portfolio. The Altus transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023. We also \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 29 \n\nreached an agreement with GE for the sale of our Nexus Controls business. GE will continue to provide Baker Hughes with GE&#8217;s MarkTM controls products currently in the Nexus Controls portfolio, and we will be the exclusive supplier and service provider of such GE products for our oil and gas customers&#8217; control needs. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2023. \n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this crisis have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. As we announced in March 2022, we suspended any new investments for our Russia operations. Over the course of 2022, changes to sanctions continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging. As a result, we took actions to suspend substantially all of our operational activities related to Russia across the Company including suspending work on equipment and service contracts in Russia, and we completed the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business to local management in the fourth quarter of 2022. Russia represented approximately 2%, 5%, and 5% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nAs we look ahead to 2023, the global economy is expected to experience some challenges under the weight of inflationary pressures and tightening monetary conditions. Despite recessionary pressures in some of the world&#8217;s largest economies, we maintain a positive outlook for the energy sector. With years of under investment now being amplified by recent geopolitical factors, global spare capacity for oil and gas has deteriorated and will likely require years of investment growth to meet forecasted future demand. For this reason, we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a multi-year upturn in global activity and are poised to see a second consecutive year of strong growth in global upstream spending in 2023. \n\nWe remain positive on the near term and long term prospects for the natural gas and LNG investment cycle. Near term, we believe that the likely reopening of China, combined with Europe&#8217;s need to refill gas storage supplies, will play a critical role in keeping global gas and LNG markets tight. Longer term, we remain optimistic on the structural growth outlook for natural gas and LNG as the world looks to lower emissions and displace the consumption of coal. In addition to the strong growth in traditional oil and gas spending, we also believe that the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and potential new legislation in Europe will support significant growth opportunities in new energy in 2023 and beyond. \n\nOUTLOOK \n\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to changing conditions in the industry. \n\n&#8226; OFSE North America activity: We expect North American spending to continue to improve in 2023, as compared to 2022, should commodity prices remain at current levels. \n\n&#8226; OFSE International activity: We expect spending outside of North America to experience strong growth in 2023, as compared to 2022, should commodity prices remain at current levels. \n\n&#8226; IET LNG projects: We remain optimistic on the LNG market long-term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive. \n\nWe have other businesses in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth. We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of energy and broader industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and energy storage. We expect to see continued growth in these businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix. \n\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the oil and gas industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility. Over time, we believe the world&#8217;s demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 30 \n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT \n\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company. \n\nOur revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows. \n\nOil and Natural Gas Prices \n\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 \n\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1) \n\n$ 100.93 $ 70.86 $ 41.96 \n\nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2) \n\n94.90 68.14 39.16 \n\nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3) \n\n6.45 3.89 2.03 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel \n\n(2) EIA Cushing, OK WTI (\"West Texas Intermediate\") spot price \n\n(3) EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit \n\nOil and natural gas prices increased during 2022 largely driven by supply constraints which has also been amplified as a result of recent geopolitical events. \n\nOutside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. The average Brent oil prices increased to $100.93/Bbl in 2022 from $70.86/Bbl in 2021 and ranged from a low of $76.02/Bbl in December 2022, to a high of $133.18/Bbl in March 2022. The average Brent oil prices increased to $70.86/Bbl in 2021 from $41.96/Bbl in 2020 and ranged from a low of $50.37/Bbl in January 2021, to a high of $85.76/Bbl in October 2021. \n\nIn North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similarly to Brent oil prices, on average increased to $94.90/Bbl in 2022 from $68.14/Bbl in 2021, and ranged from a low of $71.05/Bbl in December 2022, to a high of $123.64/Bbl in March 2022. WTI oil prices on average increased to $68.14/Bbl in 2021 from $39.16/Bbl in 2020, and ranged from a low of $47.47/Bbl in January 2021, to a high of $85.64/Bbl in October 2021. \n\nIn North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $6.45/mmBtu in 2022, representing a 66% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $9.85/mmBtu in August 2022, to a low of $3.46/mmBtu in November 2022. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, working natural gas in storage at the end of 2022 was 2,891 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 9.5%, or 304 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2021. Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price averaged $3.89/mmBtu in 2021, representing a 92% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $23.86/mmBtu in February 2021, to a low of $2.43/mmBtu in April 2021. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, working natural gas in storage at the end of 2021 was 3,226 billion cubic feet (\"Bcf\"), which was 6.8%, or 234 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2020. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 31 \n\nBaker Hughes Rig Count \n\nThe Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity. \n\nWe have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available. \n\nRigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started, but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits. \n\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 North America 898 610 522 International 851 756 827 Worldwide 1,749 1,366 1,349 ##TABLE_END\n\n2022 Compared to 2021 \n\nOverall the rig count was 1,749 in 2022, an increase of 28% as compared to 2021 due to an increase in activity in North America and internationally. The rig count in North America increased 47% and the international rig count increased 13% in 2022 compared to 2021. \n\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was up 51% on average when compared to the same period last year, and an increase in the Canada rig count, which was up 32% on average. Internationally, the increase in the rig count was driven by increases in the Latin America region, Africa region, Middle East region, and Asia-Pacific region of 22%, 19%, 16%, and 8%, respectively. \n\n2021 Compared to 2020 \n\nOverall the rig count was 1,366 in 2021, an increase of 1% as compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in activity in North America partially offset by declines internationally. The rig count in North America increased 17% and the international rig count decreased 9% in 2021 compared to 2020. \n\nWithin North America, the increase was primarily driven by the Canadian rig count, which was up 48% on average when compared to the same period last year, and an increase in the U.S. rig count, which was up 10% on average. Internationally, the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the Middle East region, Africa region, and Europe region of 21%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 32 \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. \n\nOur results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, goodwill and inventory impairments, separation related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments. \n\nIn evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following: \n\nVolume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services. \n\nForeign Exchange (\"FX\"): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period. \n\n(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation and benefits, and overhead costs. \n\nProductivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume and price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes. \n\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations \n\nOur consolidated statements of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which &#8220;goods&#8221; is required to include all sales of tangible products and &#8220;services&#8221; must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between &#8220;equipment&#8221; and &#8220;product services,&#8221; where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to &#8220;product services&#8221; simply as &#8220;services&#8221; within Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\nOrders : We recognized orders of $26.8 billion, $21.7 billion, and $20.7 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $14.1 billion, $11.8 billion, and $12.3 billion and IET orders of $12.7 billion, $9.9 billion, and $8.4 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Within IET, Gas Technology Equipment orders were $6.4 billion, $3.9 billion, $3.0 billion, and Gas Technology Services orders were $3.0 billion, $2.9 billion, and $2.6 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 33 \n\nRemaining Performance Obligations (\"RPO\"): As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was $27.8 billion and $23.6 billion, respectively.

This increase in revenue was largely a result of increased activity in OFSE, partially offset by a decline in IET. OFSE increased $1,201 million and IET decreased $547 million. \n\nTotal segment operating income in 2022 was $2,336 million, an increase of $330 million, or 16%, from 2021. The increase was primarily driven by OFSE, which increased $371 million, partially offset by IET which decreased $42 million. \n\nOilfield Services &#38; Equipment \n\nOFSE 2022 revenue was $13,229 million, an increase of $1,201 million, or 10%, from 2021, primarily as a result of increased activity in North America and internationally, as evidenced by an increase in the global rig count. North America revenue was $3,764 million in 2022, an increase of $860 million from 2021. International revenue was $9,465 million in 2022, an increase of $341 million from 2021, primarily driven by growth in Latin America and the Middle East, partially offset by declines in the Russia Caspian and Europe regions. The year-over-year revenue was reduced by the removal of the subsea drilling systems (\"SDS\") business from the consolidated OFSE operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the formation of a joint venture. \n\nOFSE 2022 segment operating income was $1,201 million, compared to $830 million in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume and price, partially offset by logistics and commodity cost inflation. \n\nIndustrial &#38; Energy Technology \n\nIET 2022 revenue was $7,926 million, a decrease of $547 million, or 6%, from 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in both Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services, the impact from foreign currency translation, and supply chain delays in Gas Technology Services, partially offset by higher volume in Industrial Technology. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 35 \n\nIET 2022 segment operating income was $1,135 million, compared to $1,177 million in 2021. The decrease in profitability was driven by lower volume, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, higher research and development costs, and inflationary pressure, partially offset by favorable business mix and higher pricing in certain product lines. \n\nCorporate \n\nIn 2022, corporate expenses were $416 million, a decrease of $13 million compared to 2021, primarily d riven by cost efficiencies and past restructuring actions. \n\nInventory Impairment \n\nIn 2022, we recorded inventory impairments of $31 million primarily in IET as part of suspending our Russia operations. Inventory impairments are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). There were no inventory impairments during 2021. \n\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other \n\nIn 2022 , we recognized $682 million of restructuring, impairment and other charges, primarily related to the suspension of substantially all of our operations in Russia, as well as, costs incurred to facilitate our reorganization into two segments and the implementation of certain projects in our OFSE segment to optimize their global footprint. In addition, we impaired certain long-lived assets in our OFSE segment for the subsea production systems (\"SPS\") business due to a decrease in the estimated future cash flows driven by a decline in our long-term market outlook for this business. In 2021, we recognized $209 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges. The charges in 2021 primarily related to the initiatives in our OFSE segment that were the continuation of our overall strategy to right-size our structural costs. \n\nSeparation Related \n\nWe recorded $23 million of separation related costs in 2022, a decrease of $37 million from the prior year. Costs relate to the activities for the separation from GE, primarily related to information technology. Separation activities were substantially completed by the end of 2022. \n\nOther Non-Operating Loss, Net \n\nIn 2022, we recorded $911 million of other non-operating loss, an increase of $328 million from the prior year, primarily due to the loss of $451 million from the sale of part of the OFSE business in Russia. We also recorded $265 million of unrealized losses related to marking our investments in C3 AI and ADNOC to fair value. Additionally, in December 2022, the Company, BHH LLC and GE entered into an agreement which resulted in the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\"), and as a result, we recorded a charge of $81 million, of which $21 million was a cash payment to GE as a net settlement of claims asserted under the TMA. See \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" for further information. \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\nIn 2022, we incurred interest expense, net of interest income, of $252 million, a decrease of $47 million from the prior year, driven primarily by higher interest income, and lower interest expense due to $28 million of non-recurring costs in 2021 associated with the refinancing of our senior notes. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIn 2022, our provision for income taxes was $600 million. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily related to losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances, restructuring charges for which a majority has no tax benefit, and earnings in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the U.S. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 36 \n\nIn 2021, our provision for income taxes was $758 million. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily related to losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances and changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. \n\nFiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2020 \n\nRevenue in 2021 was $20,502 million, a decrease of $203 million, or 1%, from 2020. This decrease in revenue was largely a result of decreased activity in OFSE, partially offset by an increase in IET. OFSE decreased $956 million and IET increased $754 million. \n\nTotal segment operating income in 2021 was $2,006 million, an increase of $502 million, or 33%, from 2020. The increase was driven by OFSE, which increased $324 million, and IET, which increased $178 million. \n\nOilfield Services &#38; Equipment \n\nOFSE 2021 revenue was $12,028 million, a decrease of $956 million, or 7%, from 2020, primarily as a result of decreased international activity in 2021 compared to 2020, as evidenced by a decline in the corresponding rig count, and, to a lesser extent, decreased activity in North America, and supply chain constraints that occurred in the second half of 2021. International revenue was $9,124 million in 2021, a decrease of $753 million from 2020, primarily driven by declines in the Middle East, partially offset by growth in Latin America. North America revenue was $2,904 million in 2021, a decrease of $203 million from 2020. The decrease in revenue was also driven by the disposition of the surface pressure control flow business in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the removal of SDS from consolidated OFSE operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the formation of a joint venture. \n\nOFSE 2021 segment operating income was $830 million, compared to $506 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher cost productivity as a result of cost efficiencies and restructuring actions. Additional drivers were increases in price in certain product lines, partially offset by lower volume. \n\nIndustrial &#38; Energy Technology \n\nIET 2021 revenue was $8,473 million, an increase of $754 million, or 10%, from 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume for both Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services, partially offset by supply chain constraints that impacted product deliveries, mainly in the Industrial Technology product lines. \n\nIET 2021 segment operating income was $1,177 million, compared to $998 million in 2020. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher volume, price, and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. \n\nCorporate \n\nIn 2021, corporate expenses were $429 million, a decrease of $35 million compared to 2020 , primarily d riven by lower expenses as a result of cost out programs and restructuring actions. \n\nInventory Impairment \n\nThere were no inventory impairments during 2021. In 2020, we recorded inventory impairments of $246 million primarily related to our OFSE segment as a result of certain restructuring activities initiated by the Company. Charges for inventory impairments are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nGoodwill Impairment \n\nThere were no goodwill impairments during 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company&#8217;s market capitalization declined significantly driven by current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions including the decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices driven by both surplus production and supply. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 37 \n\ngoodwill impairment charge of $14,773 million during the first quarter of 2020. There were no other goodwill impairments during 2020. \n\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other \n\nIn 2021, we recognized $209 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges. The charges in 2021 primarily relate to the initiatives in our OFSE segment that are the continuation of our overall strategy to right-size our structural costs. In 2020, we recognized $1,866 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges. These charges primarily related to the restructuring plan announced in the first quarter of 2020, which included product line rationalization actions, headcount reductions in certain geographical locations, and other initiatives to right-size operations for anticipated activity levels and market conditions. \n\nSeparation Related \n\nWe recorded $60 million of separation related costs in 2021, a decrease of $74 million from the prior year, largely driven by a reduction in the ongoing activities for the separation from GE, primarily related to information technology. \n\nOther Non-Operating Income/(Loss), Net \n\nIn 2021, we recorded $583 million of other non-operating loss. Costs in 2021 include an unrealized loss of $1,085 million from marking our investment in C3 AI to fair value, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $241 million from marking our investment in ADNOC Drilling to fair value, by the reversal of $121 million of current accruals d ue to the settlement of certain legal matters, and by income of $121 million for liabilities previously expected to be recoverable as they were indemnified under the TMA with GE. This income from indemnified liabilities has an offset in the \"Provision for income taxes\" caption in our consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nIn 2020, we recorded $1,040 million of other non-operating income. Included in this amount was an unrealized gain of $1,417 million related to marking our investment in C3 AI to fair value, partially offset by losses of $353 million for the sale of two product lines in OFSE, the rod lift systems business and the surface pressure control flow business. \n\nInterest Expense, Net \n\nIn 2021, we incurred net interest expense of $299 million, an increase of $35 million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest expense, mainly related to $28 million of costs associated with the refinancing of our senior notes due December 2022, and lower interest income. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIn 2021, our income tax expense was $758 million, an increase of $199 million, from $559 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and the geographical mix of earnings. Our 2021 income tax expense included $121 million that we previously expected to be recoverable as it related to liabilities indemnified under the TMA with GE. This tax expense has an offset in the \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" caption in our consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nCOMPLIANCE \n\nIn the conduct of all of our activities, we are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System (\"QMS\"). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program (\"Compliance Program\") which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 38 \n\nHighlights of our Compliance Program include the following: \n\n&#8226; Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes. In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws. \n\n&#8226; Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating allegations across all regions and countries where we do business. \n\n&#8226; Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis. \n\n&#8226; Due diligence and monitoring procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), and administrative service providers. \n\n&#8226; Due diligence procedures for acquisition activities. \n\n&#8226; Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk. \n\n&#8226; Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as segment compliance review boards that meet quarterly. \n\n&#8226; Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a conflict of interest reporting and management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening. \n\n&#8226; Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements. \n\n&#8226; A compliance program designed to create an &#8220;Open Reporting Environment&#8221; where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages. \n\n&#8226; Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies. \n\n&#8226; Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties. \n\n&#8226; We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire training module which includes compliance training for all employees. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nOur objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. We continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2021. \n\nIn the U.S. we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.6 billion and $1.6 billion and outside the U.S. of approximately $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held outside the U.S. at December 31, 2022 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may incur other additional taxes that would not be significant to the total tax provision. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 39 \n\nWe have a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (\"the Credit Agreement\") with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. In addition, we have a commercial paper program with authorization up to $3 billion under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the commercial paper program. \n\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See \"Note 9. Borrowings\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Our next debt maturity is December 2023. \n\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a global pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, repurchases of our common stock, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. \n\nCash Flows \n\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating activities $ 1,888 $ 2,374 $ 1,304 Investing activities (1,564) (463) (618) Financing activities (1,592) (2,143) 225 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating Activities \n\nCash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,888 million, $2,374 million, and $1,304 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services. \n\nIn 2022, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, loss on business dispositions, stock based compensation cost, loss on equity securities, and the impairment of certain assets). Working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets, generated cash of $122 million in 2022 primarily due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in receivables and inventory as we build for revenue growth. \n\nIn 2021, working capital generated $480 million of cash primarily due to accounts payable, inventories and contract and other deferred assets partially offset by accounts receivable and progress collections, as we continued to make progress on improving our working capital processes. Restructuring and GE separation related payments \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 40 \n\nwere $175 million on a net basis in 2021 and included the proceeds from the disposal of certain facilities, which are reflected below in investing activities. \n\nIn 2020, working capital generated $216 million of cash primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable. Restructuring and GE separation related payments were $670 million in 2020. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nCash flows from investing activities used cash of $1,564 million, $463 million, and $618 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $989 million, $856 million, and $974 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $217 million, $315 million, and $187 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets are primarily related to equipment that was lost-in-hole, predominantly in OFSE, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period. \n\nIn 2022, we paid $845 million for both acquisitions and investments in business interests. We completed several acquisitions during 2022 including BRUSH Power Generation, Quest Integrity, AccessESP, and Mosaic Materials. The total cash paid, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions was $767 million, and we used cash on hand to fund these transactions. \n\nIn 2021, we contributed our SDS business to create a joint venture and received as consideration 50% of the shares of the joint venture, cash of $70 million, and a promissory note of $80 million. In 2020, we received proceeds of $187 million primarily from the sale of our rod lift systems and our surface pressure control flow businesses. \n\nIn 2021, we invested $266 million to add capabilities to our new energy and industrial asset management offerings through the acquisition of business interests in Augury, Ekona Power, Electrochaea, and the acquisition of ARMS Reliability, among others. Also in 2021, we sold approximately 2.2 million C3 AI Shares and received proceeds of $145 million, which is included in other investing activities. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash flows from financing activities used cash of $1,592 million, $2,143 million, and generated cash of $225 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nWe had net repayments of short-term debt of $28 million, $41 million, and $204 million and long-term debt of nil, $1,313 million, and $42 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The repayment of long-term debt in 2021 was primarily driven by the early repayment of our 2.773% Senior Notes due December 2022 (\"the 2022 Notes\") with a principal amount of $1,250 million. In addition, a charge of $28 million related to the early redemption was recorded within \"Interest expense, net\" in our consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nIn 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by one cent to $0.19 per share during the fourth quarter. We paid dividends of $726 million, $592 million, and $488 million to our Class A stockholders, and we made distributions of $17 million, $157 million, and $256 million to GE in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. \n\nIn 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our repurchase program of $2 billion of additional Class A common stock and LLC units for each of the Company and BHH LLC, respectively, increasing its existing repurchase authorization of $2 billion to $4 billion. During 2022, the Company and BHH LLC repurchased and canceled 29.7 million shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units, respectively, for a total of $828 million. \n\nIn 2021, we received proceeds from the issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 1.231% Senior Notes due December 2023 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.061% Senior Notes due December \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 41 \n\n2026. In 2020, we had proceeds from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.486% Senior Notes due May 2030. \n\nIn 2021, we repaid $832 million (&#163;600 million) of commercial paper originally issued in 2020 ($737 million at date of issuance) under the COVID Corporate Financing Facility established by the Bank of England. \n\nDuring 2021, the Company and BHH LLC repurchased and canceled 17.6 million shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units, respectively, for a total of $434 million. \n\nCash Requirements \n\nWe believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, access to both our commercial paper program or our uncommitted lines of credit, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity in the short-term and long-term to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, repay debt, repurchase our common stock, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. When necessary, we issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S. \n\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2023 will be made at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $500 million to $550 million in 2023. \n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments \n\nOur material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, leases for property and equipment, and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. Certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. \n\nSee &#8220;Note 9. Borrowings&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our long-term debt. See &#8220;Note 8. Leases&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our operating leases. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had expected cash payments for estimated interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $267 million payable within the next twelve months and $2,936 million payable thereafter. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had purchase obligations of $1,584 million payable within the next twelve months and $907 million payable thereafter. Our purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2023 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n\nDue to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $665 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations discussed above. See \"Note 11. Income Taxes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 42 \n\nOther factors affecting liquidity \n\nCustomer receivables : In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2022, 15% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S. and 11% were from customers in Mexico. As of December 31, 2021, 13% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S and 12% were from customers in Mexico. \n\nInternational operations : Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 77% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2022. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash. \n\nSupply chain finance programs : Under supply chain finance programs, administered by a third party, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. These liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies. \n\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment, but they are not deemed critical as defined above. \n\nRevenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements \n\nWe have long-term service agreements with our customers within our IET segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an over time basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 43 \n\nTo develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable. \n\nTo develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process. \n\nWe routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. \n\nRevisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement&#8217;s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $20 million, $14 million and $17 million for the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. \n\nRevenue Recognition on Sale of Customized Equipment \n\nWe recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have historically promised and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss. The total revenue recognized for the sale of equipment on an over time basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $4.2 billion, $4.8 billion, and $4.6 billion, respectively. \n\nGoodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets \n\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples, and comparable transactions. Cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors, such as management&#8217;s projections of future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, and long-term growth rates. Market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those assumed in our analysis. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our forecasts, business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments, potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units. Any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 44 \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and U.S. GAAP in various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our rate may be further impacted by the repatriation of foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent the repatriation would result in additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management&#8217;s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable. \n\nDeferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. \n\nOur tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $496 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2022. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nThe estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for credit losses totaled $341 million and $400 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required. \n\nInventory Reserves \n\nInventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements, and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, inventory reserves totaled $396 million and $374 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required. \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED \n\nSee \"Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of accounting standards to be adopted. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 45 \n\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS \n\nSee \"Note 18. Related Party Transactions\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further discussion of related party transactions. \n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\nThis Form 10-K, including MD&#38;A and certain statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a \"forward-looking statement\"). Forward-looking statements concern future circumstances and results and other statements that are not historical facts and are sometimes identified by the words \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"potential,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"endeavor,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"overestimate,\" \"underestimate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"project,\" \"predict,\" \"continue,\" \"target\" or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation that such plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include, among others, the risk factors in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Part 1 of Item 1A of this Form 10-K and those set forth from time-to-time in other filings by the Company with the SEC. These documents are available through our website or through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval (\"EDGAR\") system at http://www.sec.gov. \n\nIn light of such risks and uncertainties, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report, or if earlier, as of the date they were made. We do not intend to, and disclaim any obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements unless required by securities law. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nWe are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. A discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below. \n\nINTEREST RATE RISK \n\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million that converted a portion of our $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.337% fixed rate Senior Notes due 2027 into a floating rate instrument with an interest rate based on a LIBOR index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk. The interest rate swaps are designated and each qualify as a fair value hedging instrument. The interest rate swaps are considered to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged liability, and no ineffectiveness is recognized. The mark-to-market of this fair value hedge was recorded as gain or loss in interest expense and was equally offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also was recorded in interest expense. \n\nThe following table sets forth our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total (2) \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 Long-term debt (1) \n\n$ 650 $ 107 $ &#8212; $ 600 $ 1,350 $ 3,756 $ 6,463 Weighted average interest rates \n\n1.46 % 4.07 % &#8212; % 2.36 % 3.75 % 4.06 % 3.59 % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Fair market value of our fixed rate long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was $5.8 billion at December 31, 2022. \n\n(2) Amounts represent the principal value of our long-term debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 46 \n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK \n\nWe conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies, and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency. As such, future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. \n\nAdditionally, we buy, manufacture and sell components and products across global markets. These activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses. When the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates, it will affect the revenue earned on the sale. These sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates. Changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing. We use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures, where appropriate. \n\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. We had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $3 billion and $3.3 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The notional amount of these derivative instruments do not generally represent cash amounts exchanged by us and the counterparties, but rather the nominal amount upon which changes in the value of the derivatives are measured. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates that a 1% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar would result in an impact of less than $10 million to our pre-tax earnings, however, the Company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure, where there are liquid financial markets, through use of foreign currency derivative transactions. Also, see \"Note 15. Financial Instruments\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which has additional details on our strategy. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 47 \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. This conclusion is based on the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nKPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n/s/ LORENZO SIMONELLI \n\nLorenzo Simonelli \n\nChairman, President and \n\nChief Executive Officer \n\n&#160; \n\n/s/ NANCY BUESE \n\nNancy Buese \n\nChief Financial Officer \n\n&#160; \n\n/s/ KURT CAMILLERI \n\nKurt Camilleri \n\nSenior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nHouston, Texas \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 48 \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors \n\nBaker Hughes Company: \n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Baker Hughes Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\nRevenue recognition on certain agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications \n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications on an over time basis. Revenue from these types of contracts is recognized to the extent of progress towards completion measured by actual costs incurred relative to total expected costs. The Company provides for potential losses on these types of contracts when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. \n\nWe identified revenue recognition for certain contracts from the sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company's long-term estimates of the expected costs to be incurred in order to complete these contracts. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 49 \n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company&#8217;s revenue recognition process for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications. This included controls pertaining to the Company's estimation of costs expected to be incurred to complete contracts for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate costs expected to be incurred to complete the contracts for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications. We evaluated the estimated costs expected to be incurred to complete the equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications for the contracts by: \n\n&#8211; questioning the Company's finance and project managers regarding progress to date based on the latest project reports and the costs expected to still be incurred until completion; \n\n&#8211; observing project review meetings performed by the Company or inspecting relevant minutes of those meetings to identify changes in the estimated costs expected to be incurred to complete the contract and related contract margins; \n\n&#8211; assessing the remaining estimated costs expected to be incurred by expenditure category by comparing to the actual costs incurred during the current year for the selected project; and \n\n&#8211; investigating changes to the contract margin when compared to the prior year's estimated contract margin. \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 2017. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nHouston, Texas \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 50 \n\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors \n\nBaker Hughes Company: \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Baker Hughes Company and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ KPMG LLP \n\nHouston, Texas \n\nFebruary 14, 2023 \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 51 \n\nBAKER HUGHES COMPANY \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS) \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Revenue: Sales of goods $ 12,236 &#160;

Supplementary Information\" for additional cash flow disclosures \n\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 56 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS \n\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes\", \"the Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our wholly owned operating company, Baker Hughes Holdings LLC (\"BHH LLC\"). As of December 31, 2022, General Electric Company (\"GE\") no longer had an economic interest in BHH LLC. As of December 31, 2021, GE's economic interest in BHH LLC was 11.4 %. See \"Note 13. Equity\" for further information. BHH LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov. \n\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION \n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\" and such principles, \"U.S. GAAP\") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for annual financial information. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baker Hughes and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \n\nIn the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes, certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, all dollar and share amounts in tabulations are in millions of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Certain columns and rows in our financial statements and notes thereto may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. \n\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets or liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following: allowance for credit losses and inventory valuation reserves; recoverability of long-lived assets; revenue recognition on long-term contracts; valuation of goodwill; useful lives used in depreciation and amortization; income taxes and related valuation allowances; accruals for contingencies; actuarial assumptions to determine costs and liabilities related to employee benefit plans; stock-based compensation expense; valuation of derivatives; and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars using our period end exchange rates, and revenue, expenses, and cash flows have been translated at average rates for the respective periods. Any resulting translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income (loss). \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 57 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables in the non-functional currency and those resulting from remeasurements of monetary items of non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are included in the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nRevenue from Sale of Equipment \n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time \n\nWe recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis, utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We begin to recognize revenue on these contracts when the contract specific inventory becomes customized for a customer, which is reflective of our initial transfer of control of the incurred costs. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss. \n\nOur billing terms for these over time contracts vary, but are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. \n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point In Time \n\nWe recognize revenue for non-customized equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good. Equipment for which we recognize revenue at a point in time includes equipment we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics associated with the shipment, whereas the delivery of other equipment is generally determined based on historical data of transit times between regions. \n\nOn occasion we sell equipment with a right of return. We use our accumulated experience to estimate and provide for such returns when we record the sale. In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment and that acceptance has or is likely to occur. \n\nOur billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary, but are generally based on shipment of the equipment to the customer. \n\nRevenue from Sale of Services \n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time \n\nWe sell product services under long-term product maintenance or extended warranty agreements in our Industrial &#38; Energy Technology segment. These agreements require us to maintain the customers' assets over the service agreement contract terms, which generally range from 10 to 20 years. In general, these are contractual arrangements to provide services, repairs, and maintenance of a covered unit (gas turbines for mechanical drive or power generation, primarily on LNG applications). These services are performed at various times during the life of the contract, thus the costs of performing services are incurred on an other than straight-line basis. We recognize related sales based on the extent of our progress toward completion measured by actual costs incurred in relation to total expected costs. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on any of these agreements when that loss becomes probable. The Company utilizes historical customer data, prior product performance data, statistical analysis, third-party data, and internal management estimates to calculate contract-specific margins. In certain contracts, the total transaction price is variable based on customer utilization, which is excluded from the contract margin until the period that the customer has utilized to appropriately reflect the revenue activity in the period earned. In addition, revenue for certain oilfield services is recognized on an over time basis as performed. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 58 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nOur billing terms for these contracts are generally based on asset utilization (i.e. usage per hour) or the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. \n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point In Time \n\nWe sell certain tangible products, largely spare equipment, through our services business. We recognize revenue for this equipment at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer. Our billing terms for these point in time service contracts vary, but are generally based on shipment of the equipment to the customer. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and relate to the research and development of new products and services. These costs amounted to $ 556 million, $ 492 million and $ 595 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses were reported in cost of goods sold and cost of services sold. \n\nSeparation Related \n\nSeparation related costs relate to activities performed to facilitate the separation from GE including costs for the build-out of certain information technology infrastructures as a result of the separation. Separation activities were substantially completed by the end of 2022. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nShort-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are included in cash equivalents unless designated as available-for-sale and classified as investment securities. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 605 million and $ 601 million, respectively, of cash held in bank accounts that cannot be readily released, transferred or otherwise converted into a currency that is regularly transacted internationally, due to lack of market liquidity, capital controls or similar monetary or exchange limitations limiting the flow of capital out of the jurisdiction. These funds are available to fund operations and growth in these jurisdictions and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the U.S. \n\nAllowance for Credit Losses \n\nWe monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability of the related financial assets are reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. \n\nConcentration of Credit Risk \n\nOur current receivables are spread over a broad and diverse group of customers across many countries. We grant credit to our customers and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions, including monitoring our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to manage this risk. We do not generally require collateral in support of our current receivables, but we may require payment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit or a bank guarantee. \n\nInventories \n\nAll inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable values and they are measured on a first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") basis or average cost basis. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 59 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nslow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (\"PP&#38;E\") \n\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially stated at cost and is depreciated over its estimated economic life. Subsequently, property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided by using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the individual assets, and impairment losses. We manufacture a substantial portion of our tools and equipment in our OFSE segment and the cost of these items, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing costs, is capitalized in inventory and subsequently moved to PP&#38;E. \n\nOther Intangible Assets \n\nWe amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. The cost of intangible assets is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated economic life. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value as required. Refer to the Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets accounting policy. \n\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-lived Assets \n\nWe perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. However, if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value, which is generally calculated using a combination of market, comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches. See \"Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for further information on valuation methodology and impairment of goodwill. \n\nWe review PP&#38;E, intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. \n\nFinancial Instruments \n\nOur financial instruments include cash and equivalents, current receivables, investments, accounts payables, short and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments. \n\nWe monitor our exposure to various business risks including commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates and we regularly use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. At the inception of a new derivative, we designate the derivative as a hedge or we determine the derivative to be undesignated as a hedging instrument. We document the relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We assess whether the \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 60 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nderivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. \n\nWe have a program that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to have gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the foreign currency transaction and translation gains or losses to the extent practical. These foreign currency exposures typically arise from changes in the value of assets (for example, current receivables) and liabilities (for example, current payables) which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity. We record all derivatives as of the end of our reporting period in our consolidated statements of financial position at fair value. For the forward contracts held as undesignated hedging instruments, we record the changes in fair value of the forward contracts in our consolidated statements of income (loss) along with the change in the fair value, related to foreign exchange movements, of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. \n\nFair Value Measurements \n\nFor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. \n\nObservable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: \n\n&#8226; Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \n\n&#8226; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. \n\n&#8226; Level 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. \n\nWe maintain policies and procedures to value instruments using the best and most relevant data available. In addition, we perform reviews to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. With regard to Level 3 valuations (including instruments valued by third parties), we perform a variety of procedures to assess the reasonableness of the valuations. Such reviews include an evaluation of instruments whose fair value change exceeds predefined thresholds (and/or does not change) and consider the current interest rate, currency and credit environment, as well as other published data, such as rating agency market reports and current appraisals. \n\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements \n\nDerivatives \n\nWhen we have Level 1 derivatives, which are traded either on exchanges or liquid over-the-counter markets, we use closing prices for valuation. The majority of our derivatives are valued using internal models and are included in Level 2. These internal models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 primarily represent foreign currency and commodity forward contracts for the Company. \n\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities \n\nWhen available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities, and they are included in Level 1. Level 1 securities primarily include publicly traded equity securities. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 61 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nFor investment securities for which market prices are observable for identical or similar investment securities but not readily accessible for each of those investments individually (that is, it is difficult to obtain pricing information for each individual investment security at the measurement date), we use pricing models that are consistent with what other market participants would use. The inputs and assumptions to the models are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related data. Thus, certain securities may not be priced using quoted prices, but rather determined from market observable information. These investments are included in Level 2. When we use valuations that are based on significant unobservable inputs we classify the investment securities in Level 3. \n\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements \n\nCertain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, equity securities without readily determinable fair value, equity method investments and long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired, and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity. \n\nInvestments in Equity Securities \n\nInvestments in equity securities (of entities in which we do not have either a controlling financial interest or significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 0% to 20%) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings and reported in \"other non- operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss). Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar equity securities of the same issuer. These changes are recorded in \"other non-operating income (loss), net\" in the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nEquity method investments are equity holdings in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest, but over which we have significant influence, most often because we hold a voting interest of 20% to 50%. The results of our equity method investments are presented in the consolidated statements of income (loss) as follows: (i) if the investment is integral to our operations, their results are included in \"Selling, general and administrative,\" and (ii) if the investment is not integral to our operations, their results are included in \"Other non-operating income (loss), net.\" Investments in, and advances to, equity method investments are presented on a one-line basis in the caption \"All other assets\" in our consolidated statements of financial position. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe file U.S. federal and state income tax returns which primarily includes our distributive share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of BHH LLC, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. As such, BHH LLC will not itself be subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. Non-U.S. current and deferred income taxes owed by the subsidiaries of BHH LLC are reflected in the financial statements. \n\nWe account for taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax base of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered, as well as for net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes is not more likely than not to be realized. \n\nWe provide U.S. deferred taxes on our outside basis difference in our investment in BHH LLC. In determining this outside basis difference, we exclude non-deductible goodwill and the basis difference related to certain foreign \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 62 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\ncorporations owned by BHH LLC where the undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation have been, or will be, reinvested indefinitely. \n\nIndefinite reinvestment is determined by management&#8217;s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the Company&#8217;s active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis difference is not practicable. \n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Our tax filings are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts that we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. We recognize uncertain tax positions that are &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; to be sustained if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% chance of being realized in a final settlement with the relevant authority. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in financial statements in the period they are finalized. \n\nEnvironmental Liabilities \n\nWe are involved in numerous remediation actions to clean up hazardous waste as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs exclude possible insurance recoveries and, when dates and amounts of such costs are not known, are not discounted. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. It is reasonably possible that our environmental remediation exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. The determination of the required accruals for remediation costs is subject to uncertainty, including the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the difficulty in estimating the extent and type of remediation activity that is necessary. \n\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED \n\nNew accounting pronouncements that have been issued, but not yet effective are currently being evaluated and at this time are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. \n\nNOTE 2. CURRENT RECEIVABLES \n\nCurrent receivables are comprised of the following at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Customer receivables $ 5,083 &#160; $ 4,724 &#160; Related parties &#8212; &#160; 481 &#160; Other 1,216 &#160; 846 &#160; Total current receivables 6,299 &#160; 6,051 &#160; Less: Allowance for credit losses ( 341 ) ( 400 ) Total current receivables, net $ 5,958 &#160; $ 5,651 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCustomer receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount.

See \"Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions\" for further information. \n\n(2) See \"Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions\" for further information related to acquisitions occurring during 2022. \n\n(3) The reduction in Industrial &#38; Energy Technology (\"IET\") goodwill relates to transferring our IET Nexus Controls business to held for sale. See \"Note 22. Business Held for Sale\" for further information. \n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units as of July 1 of each fiscal year, in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process. We also test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances occur which, in our judgment, could more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more reporting units below its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, (i) the results of our most recent annual or interim impairment testing, in particular the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed, (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts, and the magnitude thereof, if any, and (iii) declines in our market capitalization below our book value, and the magnitude and duration of those declines, if any. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we completed our annual impairment test for each of our reporting units and determined that the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for each reporting unit except for Subsea &#38; Surface Pressure Systems (formerly Oilfield Equipment) resulting in an immaterial impairment of the residual amount of goodwill for this reporting unit. As previously disclosed, effective October 1, 2022, the Company reorganized to create two operating segments. In conjunction with the change in segments, the Company reevaluated its reporting units and concluded there was an immaterial change to the composition of its reporting units resulting in an immaterial goodwill allocation. In addition, we assessed our goodwill for recoverability following the reorganization, and concluded there was no impairment, which was consistent with our annual goodwill impairment test completed immediately prior to the reorganization. See \"Note 17. Segment Information\" for further details on the change in operating segments. Between our annual test and December 31, 2022, we did not identify any indicators that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value. There can be no assurances that future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions affecting our industry will not occur, which could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 65 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nIntangible assets are comprised of the following at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Customer relationships $ 1,917 &#160; $ ( 729 ) $ 1,189 &#160; $ 1,922 &#160; $ ( 752 ) $ 1,170 &#160; Technology 1,212 &#160; ( 803 ) 409 &#160; 1,090 &#160; ( 747 ) $ 343 &#160; Trade names and trademarks 287 &#160; ( 175 ) 112 &#160; 292 &#160; ( 169 ) 123 &#160; Capitalized software 1,308 &#160; ( 1,040 ) 268 &#160; 1,311 &#160; ( 1,057 ) 254 &#160; Finite-lived intangible assets 4,725 &#160; ( 2,747 ) 1,978 &#160; 4,615 &#160; ( 2,725 ) 1,890 &#160; Indefinite-lived intangible assets 2,202 &#160; &#8212; 2,202 &#160; 2,241 &#160; &#8212; 2,241 &#160; Total intangible assets $ 6,927 &#160; $ ( 2,747 ) $ 4,180 &#160; $ 6,856 &#160; $ ( 2,725 ) $ 4,131 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIntangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 35 years.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, these adjustments resulted in a net increase to the carrying value of our borrowings totaling $ 91 million and $ 162 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of total borrowings at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 5,863 million and $ 7,328 million, respectively. For a majority of our borrowings the fair value was determined using quoted period-end market prices. Where market prices are not available, we estimate fair values based on valuation methodologies using current market interest rate data adjusted for our non-performance risk. \n\nMaturities of debt for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2027, and in the aggregate thereafter, are listed in the table below: \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total debt \n\n$ 677 &#160; $ 150 &#160; $ 14 &#160; $ 611 &#160; $ 1,280 &#160; $ 3,926 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 68 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nBHH LLC has a $ 3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (\"the Credit Agreement\") with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. In addition, we have a commercial paper program with authorization up to $ 3 billion under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, BHH LLC's obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings under either the Credit Agreement or the commercial paper program. \n\nBaker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. is a co-obligor, jointly and severally with BHH LLC on our long-term debt securities. This co-obligor is a 100 %-owned finance subsidiary of BHH LLC that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a corporate co-obligor of long-term debt securities and has no assets or operations other than those related to its sole purpose. As of December 31, 2022, Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc. is a co-obligor of our long-term debt securities totaling $ 6,554 million. \n\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict BHH LLC's ability to take certain actions, including, but not limited to, the creation of certain liens securing debt, the entry into certain sale-leaseback transactions and engaging in certain merger, consolidation and asset sale transactions in excess of specified limits. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. \n\nNOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \n\nDEFINED BENEFIT PLANS \n\nCertain of our employees are covered by Company sponsored pension plans. We also maintain unfunded end-of-service benefit plans that are mandated in certain countries in which we operate. Our primary plans disclosed in 2022 included four U.S. plans and eight non-U.S. plans, primarily in the UK and Germany, all with plan assets or obligations greater than $ 20 million. We use a December 31 measurement date for these plans. These defined benefit plans generally provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of service and earnings; however, the majority of these plans are either frozen or closed to new entrants. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits, through unfunded plans, to a closed group of U.S. employees who retire and meet certain age and service requirements. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to these plans was $ 37 million and $ 50 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nFunded Status \n\nThe funded status position represents the difference between the benefit obligation and the plan assets. Our primary plans consist of seven funded plans and five unfunded plans. The projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") for pension benefits represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee services and compensation and includes an assumption about future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation (\"ABO\") is the actuarial present value of pension benefits attributed to employee service to date at present compensation levels. The ABO differs from the PBO in that the ABO does not include any assumptions about future compensation levels. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 69 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nBelow is the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and the funded status of our defined benefit plans (\"Pension Benefits\"). \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 3,550 &#160; $ 3,806 &#160; Service cost 23 &#160; 27 &#160; Interest cost 78 &#160; 64 &#160; Actuarial gain (1) \n\n( 928 ) ( 154 ) Benefits paid ( 119 ) ( 111 ) Settlements ( 24 ) ( 33 ) Acquisition 202 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other &#8212; &#160; ( 7 ) Foreign currency translation adjustments ( 148 ) ( 42 ) Benefit obligation at end of year 2,634 &#160; 3,550 &#160; Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 3,147 &#160; 3,202 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 850 ) 83 &#160; Employer contributions 32 &#160; 28 &#160; Benefits paid ( 119 ) ( 111 ) Settlements ( 24 ) ( 33 ) Acquisition 214 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency translation adjustments ( 134 ) ( 22 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year 2,266 &#160; 3,147 &#160; Funded status - underfunded at end of year $ ( 368 ) $ ( 403 ) Accumulated benefit obligation $ 2,595 &#160; $ 3,497 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The actuarial gain was primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for our plans in 2022 and 2021. \n\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position consist of the following at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 Noncurrent assets $ 58 &#160; $ 109 &#160; Current liabilities ( 15 ) ( 17 ) Noncurrent liabilities ( 411 ) ( 495 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 368 ) $ ( 403 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 70 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nInformation for the plans with ABOs and PBOs in excess of plan assets is as follows at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 1,143 &#160; $ 1,476 &#160; Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,103 &#160; $ 1,423 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ 717 &#160; $ 964 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nWe have a U.S. non-qualified supplemental pension plan (&#8220;BH SPP&#8221;) for certain employees which are included in the benefit obligations and funded status in the tables above. In order to meet a portion of our obligations of the BH SPP, we have established a trust comprised primarily of mutual fund assets. The value of these assets were $ 34 million and $ 45 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These assets are not included as plan assets or in the funded status amounts in the tables above and below. \n\nNet Periodic Cost \n\nThe components of net periodic cost are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits 2022 2021 2020 Service cost $ 23 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 27 &#160; Interest cost 78 &#160; 64 &#160; 77 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 114 ) ( 130 ) ( 121 ) Amortization of prior service credit \n\n1 &#160; 1 &#160; 1 &#160; Amortization of net actuarial loss 27 &#160; 40 &#160; 34 &#160; Curtailment / settlement loss 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 10 &#160; Net periodic cost $ 17 &#160; $ 4 &#160; $ 28 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe service cost component of the net periodic cost is included in \"operating income (loss)\" and all other components are included in the \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nAssumptions Used in Benefit Calculations \n\nAccounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit at retirement and how long they live. To reflect the obligation in today&#8217;s dollars, we discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments are expected to be made. We also need to assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments. \n\nAnother assumption used is the interest crediting rate for our U.S. qualified cash balance plan. Under the provisions of this pension plan, a hypothetical cash balance account has been established for each participant. Such accounts receive quarterly interest credits based on a prescribed formula. \n\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for these plans are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.89 &#160; % 2.15 &#160; % Rate of compensation increase 3.30 &#160; % 3.21 &#160; % Interest crediting rate 4.31 &#160; % 2.60 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 71 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost for these plans are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Pension Benefits 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.15 &#160; % 1.66 &#160; % 2.34 &#160; % Expected long-term return on plan assets \n\n3.85 &#160; % 4.07 &#160; % 4.20 &#160; % Interest crediting rate 2.60 &#160; % 2.60 &#160; % 2.60 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nWe determine the discount rate using a bond matching model, whereby the weighted average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities have maturities consistent with the timing of benefit payments. Lower discount rates increase the size of the benefit obligations while higher discount rates reduce the size of the benefit obligation. The compensation assumption is used in our active plans to estimate the annual rate at which the pay for plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase. \n\nThe expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns earned, and our expectations about the future. \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss \n\nThe amount recorded before-tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our defined benefit plans consists of the following at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Pension Benefits &#160; 2022 2021 Net actuarial loss $ 348 &#160; $ 365 &#160; Net prior service cost 15 &#160; 17 &#160; Total $ 363 &#160; $ 382 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPlan Assets \n\nWe have investment committees that meet regularly to review portfolio returns and to determine asset-mix targets based on asset/liability studies. Third-party investment consultants assist these committees in developing asset allocation strategies to determine our expected rates of return and expected risk for various investment portfolios. The investment committees considered these strategies in the formal establishment of the current asset-mix targets based on the projected risk and return levels for all major asset classes. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 72 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThe table below presents the fair value of the plan assets at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Debt securities Fixed income and cash investment funds $ 1,482 &#160; $ 1,890 &#160; Equity securities Global equity securities (1) \n\n180 &#160; 250 &#160; U.S. equity securities (1) \n\n102 &#160; 222 &#160; Insurance contracts 100 &#160; 112 &#160; Real estate 53 &#160; 59 &#160; Private equities 37 &#160; 48 &#160; \n\nOther investments (2) \n\n313 &#160; 566 &#160; Total plan assets $ 2,266 &#160; $ 3,147 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Include direct investments and investment funds. \n\n(2) Consists primarily of asset allocation fund investments. \n\nPlan assets valued using Net Asset Value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient amounted to $ 2,157 million and $ 3,028 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The percentages of plan assets valued using NAV by investment fund type for equity securities, fixed income and cash, and alternative investments were 13 %, 69 %, and 18 % as of December 31, 2022, respectively, and 16 %, 62 %, and 22 % as of December 31, 2021, respectively. Those investments that were measured at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient were excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The practical expedient was not applied for investments with a fair value of $ 109 million and $ 119 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were investments classified within Level 3 of $ 100 million and $ 112 million for non U.S. insurance contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nOther \n\nIn April 2022, we initiated the termination of one of our fully funded frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plans (the \"Plan\"), which would result in the full settlement of our Plan obligations, which at December 31, 2022 was $ 286 million. The distribution of Plan assets from the pension trust fund pursuant to the termination will not be made until the Plan termination satisfies all regulatory requirements, which we currently expect to occur by the end of 2023. We do not expect the termination to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nFunding Policy \n\nThe funding policy for our Pension Benefits is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional amounts as we may determine to be appropriate. In 2022, we contributed approximately $ 32 million, which includes benefit payments made directly to the employee for our unfunded plans. We anticipate we will contribute between approximately $ 15 million to $ 20 million to our pension plans in 2023. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 73 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThe following table presents the expected benefit payments for Pension Benefits over the next 10 years.

The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to contribute portions of their eligible compensation to an investment trust. The Company matches employee contributions at the rate of $ 1.00 per $1.00 employee contribution for the first 5 % of the employee's eligible compensation, and such contributions vest immediately. In addition, we make cash contributions for all eligible employees of 4 % of their eligible compensation and such contributions are fully vested after three years of employment. The 401(k) Plan provides several investment options, for which the employee has sole investment discretion; however, the 401(k) Plan does not offer the Company's common stock as an investment option. Our costs for the 401(k) Plan and several other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans amounted to $ 212 million and $ 194 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nWe have two non-qualified defined contribution plans that are invested through trusts. The assets and corresponding liabilities were $ 256 million and $ 322 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in the captions \"All other assets\" and \"Liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits,\" respectively, in our consolidated statements of financial position. \n\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES \n\nThe provision for income taxes is comprised of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Current: U.S. $ 6 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ ( 59 ) Foreign 489 &#160; 614 &#160; 458 &#160; Total current 495 &#160; 625 &#160; 399 &#160; Deferred: U.S. 40 &#160; ( 24 ) 11 &#160; Foreign 65 &#160; 157 &#160; 149 &#160; Total deferred 105 &#160; 133 &#160; 160 &#160; Provision for income taxes $ 600 &#160; $ 758 &#160; $ 559 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted The Inflation Reduction Act which included a number of additional credits and deductions for businesses and individuals. The tax provisions of this law, particularly the adoption of the corporate book minimum tax provision, are not effective until 2023. Currently, the Company does not believe the corporate book minimum tax provision, or any of the other tax provisions, will have a material impact on the Company for 2023, however, we will continue to monitor the future impact to Baker Hughes related to this new law. Further, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"), which was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, contained measures to assist companies, including \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 74 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nallowing net operating losses originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to be carried back up to five years. During 2020, we elected to carry back losses to 2014 and accordingly recognized a $ 117 million tax benefit. We received the cash refunds related to this benefit during 2021. \n\nThe geographic sources of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 U.S. $ ( 698 ) $ ( 724 ) $ ( 14,288 ) Foreign 720 &#160; 1,152 &#160; ( 914 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 22 &#160; $ 428 &#160; $ ( 15,202 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the loss or income before income taxes for the reasons set forth below for the years ended December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 22 &#160; $ 428 &#160; $ ( 15,202 ) Taxes at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate \n\n5 &#160; 90 &#160; ( 3,192 ) Impact of goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,102 &#160; Effect of foreign operations (1) \n\n338 &#160; 216 &#160; 148 &#160; Tax expense (benefit) due to unrecognized tax benefits ( 7 ) 201 &#160; 35 &#160; Tax impact of partnership structure \n\n6 &#160; 137 &#160; ( 33 ) Change in valuation allowances \n\n164 &#160; 70 &#160; 494 &#160; CARES Act &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 117 ) Other - net 94 &#160; 44 &#160; 122 &#160; \n\nProvision for income taxes (2) \n\n$ 600 &#160; $ 758 &#160; $ 559 &#160; Actual income tax rate 2,727.3 &#160; % 177.1 &#160; % ( 3.7 ) % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) For December 31, 2022, $ 140 million of this amount relates to the charges associated with the sale and suspension of our Russia operations. \n\n(2) For December 31, 2021, $ 121 million of this amount was previously indemnified under the Tax Matters Agreement with GE of which $ 119 million was included in tax expense due to unrecognized tax benefits. In December 2022, the Company and GE entered into an agreement to terminate the Tax Matters Agreement. See below for further information. \n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 75 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThe tax effects of our temporary differences and carryforwards are as follows at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Operating &#38; capital loss carryforwards $ 2,074 &#160; $ 2,297 &#160; Tax credit &#38; other carryforwards 1,087 &#160; 1,183 &#160; Investment in partnership 846 &#160; 457 &#160; Property 128 &#160; 156 &#160; Employee benefits 62 &#160; 116 &#160; Goodwill and other intangibles 46 &#160; 97 &#160; Receivables 94 &#160; 72 &#160; Inventory 52 &#160; 61 &#160; Other 163 &#160; 111 &#160; Total deferred income tax asset 4,552 &#160; 4,550 &#160; Valuation allowances ( 4,090 ) ( 3,928 ) Total deferred income tax asset after valuation allowance 462 &#160; 622 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Other ( 34 ) ( 14 ) Total deferred income tax liability ( 34 ) ( 14 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 428 &#160; $ 608 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 399 million of non-U.S. tax credits which may be carried forward indefinitely under applicable foreign law, $ 542 million of U.S. foreign tax credits and $ 146 million of other U.S. Federal and state tax credits and other carryforwards, the majority of which will expire after tax year 2027 under U.S. Federal and state tax law. Additionally, we had $ 1,977 million of net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), of which approximately $ 301 million will expire within five years, $ 515 million will expire between six years and 20 years, and the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely. Lastly, we had $ 97 million of capital loss carryforwards, the majority of which will expire within five years. \n\nWe record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. At December 31, 2022, $ 4,090 million of valuation allowances are recorded against various deferred tax assets, including foreign operating and capital losses of $ 1,692 million, U.S. operating and capital losses of $ 116 million, U.S. foreign and non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $ 936 million, other tax credit carryforwards of $ 109 million, and certain other U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets of $ 1,237 million. There are $ 266 million of deferred tax assets related to NOLs and $ 196 million of various other deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance as we expect that the deferred tax assets will be realized within the carryforward period. \n\nIndefinite reinvestment is determined by management&#8217;s intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the Company's active non-U.S. business operations. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount of undistributed foreign earnings is approximately $ 3,323 million. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable. \n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $ 496 million of tax liabilities for total gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. In addition to these uncertain tax positions, we had $ 127 million and $ 42 million related to interest and penalties, respectively, for total liabilities of $ 665 million for uncertain positions. If we were to prevail on all uncertain positions, the net effect would result in an income tax benefit of approximately $ 584 million. The remaining $ 81 million is comprised of $ 61 million for deferred tax assets that represent tax benefits that would be received in different taxing jurisdictions or in a different character and $ 20 million increased valuation allowances. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 76 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nThe following table presents the changes in our gross unrecognized tax benefits included in the consolidated statements of financial position. \n\n##TABLE_START Asset / (Liability) 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ ( 531 ) $ ( 483 ) Additions for tax positions of the current year ( 19 ) ( 32 ) Additions for tax positions of prior years ( 99 ) ( 166 ) Reductions for tax positions of prior years 100 &#160; 42 &#160; Settlements with tax authorities 24 &#160; 95 &#160; Lapse of statute of limitations 29 &#160; 13 &#160; Balance at end of year $ ( 496 ) $ ( 531 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, and competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of litigation in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 72 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, each of which are individually insignificant, and each of which are reasonably possible of being settled within the next twelve months. \n\nWe conduct business in more than 120 countries and are subject to income taxes in most taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, each of which may have multiple open years subject to examination. All Internal Revenue Service examinations have been completed and closed through 2019 for the most significant U.S. returns. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties. \n\nOTHER \n\nIn connection with the merger between BHI and the oil and gas business of GE in July 2017, the Company and BHH LLC had entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\") with GE. The TMA governed the administration and allocation between the parties of tax liabilities and benefits arising prior to, as a result of, and subsequent to the merger, including the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties with respect to various other tax matters. In December 2022, the Company and GE entered into an agreement which resulted in the settlement of claims asserted under the TMA and the termination of the TMA. As a result, we recorded a charge of $ 81 million, of which $ 21 million was a cash payment to GE. This charge is reported in the \"Other non-operating income (loss), net\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nNOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nThe Company has the Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTI Plan\") under which we may grant restricted stock units (\"RSU\"), performance share units (\"PSU\"), stock options and other equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors providing services to the Company and our subsidiaries. The Company also provides an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") for eligible employees. A total of up to 29.5 million shares of Class A common stock are reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the LTI Plan over its term which expires on the date of the annual meeting of the Company in 2031. A total of 27.8 million shares of Class A common stock are available for issuance as of December 31, 2022. This amount includes 20.2 million shares remaining from the initial reserve and 7.6 million shares added due to forfeitures, cancellations, and shares withheld to pay the employee's taxes, subject to the adjustments as provided in the LTI Plan. \n\nStock-based compensation cost was $ 207 million, $ 205 million and $ 210 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the calculated fair value of the award and is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the equity grant. The compensation cost is determined based on awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. There were no stock-based compensation costs capitalized as the amounts were not material. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 77 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nRestricted Stock \n\nWe may grant to our officers, directors and key employees RSUs, where each unit represents the right to receive, at the end of a stipulated period, one unrestricted share of stock with no exercise price. Certain RSUs are subject to cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging over a period of three years , or over a one year period for non-employee directors. Cash dividend equivalents are accumulated on RSUs and are payable upon vesting of the awards. We determine the fair value of RSUs based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. \n\nThe following table presents the changes in RSUs outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per unit prices): \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit Unvested balance at December 31, 2021 16,035 &#160; $ 21.50 &#160; Granted 7,203 &#160; 27.90 &#160; Vested ( 7,719 ) 21.99 &#160; Forfeited ( 1,177 ) 23.59 &#160; Unvested balance at December 31, 2022 14,342 &#160; $ 24.31 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIn 2022, the total intrinsic value of RSUs vested (defined as the value of shares awarded based on the price of our common stock at vesting date) was $ 210 million and unvested RSUs was $ 424 million. The total grant date fair value of RSUs vested in 2022 was $ 170 million. As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 181 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.77 years. \n\nPerformance Share Units \n\nWe may grant PSUs to certain officers and key employees. The PSUs are stock-based awards tied to predefined company metrics and total shareholder return (\"TSR\"). PSUs generally cliff vest after a service period of three years . Cash dividend equivalents are accumulated on certain PSUs and are payable upon vesting of the awards. The fair value of the awards determined for the predefined company metrics are based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of the TSR awards are determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation method. \n\nThe following table presents the changes in PSUs outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per unit prices): \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Unit Unvested balance at December 31, 2021 3,702 &#160; $ 22.57 &#160; Granted 1,380 &#160; 30.76 &#160; Vested ( 1,268 ) 22.70 &#160; Forfeited ( 290 ) 24.64 &#160; Unvested balance at December 31, 2022 3,525 &#160; $ 25.56 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe total intrinsic value of PSUs vested and unvested, (defined as the value of the shares awarded at the year-end market price) was $ 44 million and $ 104 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The total grant date fair value of PSUs vested in 2022 was $ 29 million. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.69 years , was $ 34 million as of December 31, 2022. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 78 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nStock Options \n\nWe previously granted stock options to our officers, directors and key employees. Stock options generally vest in equal amounts over a vesting period of three years provided that the employee has remained continuously employed by the Company through such vesting date. We have not granted stock options to officers, directors, or key employees since 2019. \n\nThe following table presents the changes in stock options outstanding and related information (in thousands, except per option prices): \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Option Outstanding at December 31, 2021 5,249 &#160; $ 31.25 &#160; Exercised ( 1,661 ) 25.82 &#160; Expired ( 681 ) 36.97 &#160; Outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2022 2,907 &#160; $ 33.02 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe weighted average remaining contractual term for options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2022 was 4.3 years. The maximum contractual term of options outstanding is 6.1 years. \n\nThere were 530 thousand, 850 thousand and 1,553 thousand options that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total fair value of options vested was $ 3 million, $ 7 million and $ 14 million, in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options was immaterial as of December 31, 2022. \n\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised (defined as the amount by which the market price of our common stock on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price of the option) in 2022 was $ 12 million. The total intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2022 was $ 5 million. The intrinsic value of stock options outstanding is calculated as the amount by which the quoted price of $ 29.53 of our common stock as of the end of 2022 exceeds the exercise price of the options. \n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \n\nThe ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock quarterly on an after-tax basis in an amount between 1 % and 20 % of their annual pay at a 15 % discount of the fair market value of our Class A common stock at the end of each quarterly offering period. An employee may not purchase more than $ 3,000 in any of the three-month measurement periods described above or $ 12,000 annually. \n\nA total of 21.5 million shares of Class A common stock are authorized for issuance, and at December 31, 2022, there were 10.5 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance. \n\nNOTE 13. EQUITY \n\nCOMMON STOCK \n\nWe are authorized to issue 2 billion shares of Class A common stock, 1.25 billion shares of Class B common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock each of which have a par value of $ 0.0001 per share. The number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022 is 1,006 million and nil , respectively. We have not issued any preferred stock. Each share of Class A and Class B common stock and the associated membership interest in BHH LLC form a paired interest. While each share of Class B common stock has equal voting rights to a share of Class A common stock, it has no economic rights, meaning holders of Class B common stock have no right to dividends or any assets in the event of liquidation of the Company. Class B common stock is entitled through their ownership of BHH LLC common units (\"LLC Units\") to receive distributions on an equal amount of any dividend paid by the Company. GE previously owned all the issued and outstanding \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 79 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nClass B common stock, however, during the fourth quarter of 2022, GE completed the exchange of their remaining Class B common stock and as of December 31, 2022, GE no longer owns any Class B common stock nor the associated common units in BHH LLC. \n\nIn 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our repurchase program of $ 2 billion of additional Class A common stock and LLC units for each of the Company and BHH LLC, respectively, increasing its existing repurchase authorization of $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion. We expect to fund the repurchase program from cash generated from operations, and we expect to make share repurchases from time to time subject to the Company's capital plan, market conditions, and other factors, including regulatory restrictions. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. In 2022 and 2021, the Company and BHH LLC repurchased and canceled 29.7 million and 17.6 million shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units, each for $ 828 million and $ 434 million, representing an average price per share of $ 27.91 and $ 24.63 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company and BHH LLC had authorization remaining to repurchase up to approximately $ 2.8 billion of its Class A common stock and LLC Units, respectively. \n\nThe following table presents the changes in the number of shares outstanding (in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Class A Common Stock Class B Common Stock Class A Common Stock Class B Common Stock Balance at beginning of year 909,142 &#160; 116,548 &#160; 723,999 &#160; 311,433 &#160; Issue of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units (1) \n\n6,316 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 4,968 &#160; &#8212; &#160; \n\nIssue of shares on exercises of stock options (1) \n\n1,632 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 408 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Issue of shares for employee stock purchase plan \n\n2,017 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,510 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Exchange of Class B common stock for Class A common stock (2) \n\n116,548 &#160; ( 116,548 ) 194,885 &#160; ( 194,885 ) Repurchase and cancellation of Class A common stock ( 29,694 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 17,628 ) &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of year 1,005,960 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 909,142 &#160; 116,548 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Share amounts reflected above are net of shares withheld to satisfy the employee's tax withholding obligation. \n\n(2) When shares of Class B common stock, together with associated LLC Units, are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, such shares of Class B common stock are canceled . \n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Company declared and paid aggregate regular dividends of $ 0.73 and $ 0.72 per share, respectively, to holders of record of the Company's Class A common stock. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 80 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS (\"AOCL\") \n\nThe following table presents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax: \n\n##TABLE_START Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Cash Flow Hedges Benefit Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 1,464 ) $ 3 &#160; $ ( 317 ) $ ( 1,778 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 344 ) ( 11 ) 135 &#160; ( 220 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss \n\n39 &#160; ( 7 ) 38 &#160; 70 &#160; Deferred taxes \n\n&#8212; &#160; 2 &#160; ( 3 ) ( 1 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 305 ) ( 16 ) 170 &#160; ( 151 ) Less: Other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 38 ) ( 3 ) 25 &#160; ( 16 ) Less: Reallocation of AOCL based on change in ownership of BHH LLC Units 394 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 78 &#160; 472 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2021 ( 2,125 ) ( 10 ) ( 250 ) ( 2,385 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications \n\n( 294 ) ( 1 ) 2 &#160; ( 293 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss \n\n25 &#160; 3 &#160; 27 &#160; 55 &#160; Deferred taxes \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 43 ) ( 43 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 269 ) 2 &#160; ( 14 ) ( 281 ) Less: Other comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 3 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) Less: Reallocation of AOCL based on change in ownership of BHH LLC Units 275 &#160; 1 &#160; 32 &#160; 308 &#160; Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 2,666 ) $ ( 9 ) $ ( 296 ) $ ( 2,971 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 represent (i) gains (losses) reclassified on cash flow hedges when the hedged transaction occurs, (ii) the amortization of net actuarial gain (loss), prior service credit, settlements, and curtailments which are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see \"Note 10.

As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted EPS of Class B under the two class method has not been presented. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for our Class B common stock were 30 million, 215 million, and 359 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The basic weighted average shares outstanding for both our Class A and Class B common stock combined were 1,017 million, 1,039 million, and 1,034 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nAn exchange agreement existed between GE, BHH LLC, and us, (\"Exchange Agreement\") where GE was entitled to exchange its holding in our Class B common stock, and associated LLC Units, for Class A common stock on a one -for-one basis (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement) or, at the option of Baker Hughes, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate value (determined in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement) of the shares of Class A common stock that would have otherwise been received by GE in the exchange. In computing the dilutive effect, if any, that the aforementioned exchange would have on net income (loss) per share, net income (loss) attributable to holders of Class A common stock would be adjusted due to the elimination of the noncontrolling interests associated with the Class B common stock (including any tax impact). For the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, such exchange is not reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share as the assumed exchange is not dilutive. As of December 31, 2022, GE no longer holds any of our Class B common stock and associated LLC Units. See \"Note 13.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 17 million and $ 39 million of derivative liabilities are recorded in \" All other current liabilities \" and $ 69 million and $ 10 million are recorded in \" All other liabilities \" of the consolidated statements of financial position, respectively. \n\nFORMS OF HEDGING \n\nCash flow hedges \n\nWe use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts. Accordingly, the vast majority of our derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in a separate component of equity (referred to as \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\", or \"AOCI\") and are recorded in earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction occurs. See \"Note 13. Equity\" for further information on activity in AOCI for cash flow hedges. The maximum term of cash flow hedges that hedge forecasted transactions was less than one year at December 31, 2022 and 2021. \n\nFair Value Hedges \n\nAll of our long-term debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments. We are subject to interest rate risk on our debt portfolio and may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 500 million that converted a portion of our $ 1,350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.337 % fixed rate Senior Notes due 2027 into a floating rate instrument with an interest rate based on a LIBOR index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk. We concluded that the interest rate swap met the criteria necessary to qualify for the short-cut method of hedge accounting, and as such, an assumption is made that the change in the fair value of the hedged debt, due to changes in the benchmark rate, exactly offsets the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps. Therefore, the derivative is considered to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged liability, and no ineffectiveness is recognized. The mark-to-market of this fair value hedge is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is equally offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 84 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nEconomic Hedges \n\nThese derivatives are not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint (and therefore we do not apply hedge accounting to the relationship), but otherwise serve the same economic purpose as other hedging arrangements. Economic hedges are marked to fair value through earnings each period. \n\nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedges in the consolidated statements of income (loss): \n\n##TABLE_START Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Consolidated statements of income (loss) caption 2022 2021 2020 \n\nCurrency exchange contracts (1) \n\nCost of goods sold $ 24 &#160; $ ( 9 ) $ 59 &#160; Currency exchange contracts Cost of services sold 18 &#160; 5 &#160; 62 &#160; Commodity derivatives Cost of goods sold ( 6 ) 1 &#160; 2 &#160; Other derivatives Other non-operating income (loss), net 2 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8 &#160; \n\nTotal (2) \n\n$ 38 &#160; $ ( 3 ) $ 131 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes a loss of nil , gains of $ 7 million and losses of $ 14 million on embedded derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as embedded derivatives are not considered to be hedging instruments in our economic hedges. \n\n(2) The effect on earnings of derivatives not designated as hedges is substantially offset by the change in fair value of the economically hedged items in the current and future periods. \n\nNOTIONAL AMOUNT OF DERIVATIVES \n\nThe notional amount of a derivative is the number of units of the underlying. A substantial majority of the outstanding notional amount of $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is related to hedges of anticipated sales and purchases in foreign currency, commodity purchases, changes in interest rates, and contractual terms in contracts that are considered embedded derivatives and for intercompany borrowings in foreign currencies. We generally disclose derivative notional amounts on a gross basis to indicate the total counterparty risk. Where we have gross purchase and sale derivative contracts for a particular currency, we look to execute these contracts with the same counterparty to reduce our exposure. The notional amount of these derivative instruments do not generally represent cash amounts exchanged by us and the counterparties, but rather the nominal amount upon which changes in the value of the derivatives are measured. \n\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK \n\nFair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in our positions. We manage counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our agreements) on an individual counterparty basis. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 85 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNOTE 16.

As of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize revenue of approximately 57 %, 70 % and 88 % of the total remaining performance obligations within 2 , 5 , and 15 years, respectively, and the remaining thereafter. Contract modifications could affect both the timing to complete as well as the amount to be received as we fulfill the related remaining performance obligations. \n\nNOTE 17. SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nThe Company's segments are determined as those operations whose results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), who is our Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Each segment is organized and managed based upon the nature of our markets and customers and consist of similar products and services. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we announced a reorganization of the Company to create two operating segments focused on different growth profiles and designed to simplify our operations and enhance profitability. Effective \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 86 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nOctober 1, 2022, the two operating segments, also our reportable segments, are Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment (&#8220;OFSE&#8221;) and Industrial &#38; Energy Technology (&#8220;IET&#8221;). The financial information for 2021 and 2020 have been recast to conform to the new segment presentation. \n\nWe previously operated the Company through four segments. Through this reorganization, we merged the Oilfield Services segment with the Oilfield Equipment segment to form the OFSE segment, and we merged the Turbomachinery &#38; Process Solutions segment with the Digital Solutions segment to form the IET segment. We believe the new structure will allow each segment to better adapt to the quickly changing energy markets, and by removing certain management layers, will upgrade a number of key operational processes across our businesses and enhance their economies of scale. The following is a description of each segment&#8217;s business operations: \n\nOilfield Services &#38; Equipment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: Well Construction, which encompasses drilling services, drill bits, and drilling &#38; completions fluids; Completions, Intervention, and Measurements , which encompasses well completions, pressure pumping, and wireline services; Production Solutions , which spans artificial lift systems and oilfield &#38; industrial chemicals, and Subsea &#38; Surface Pressure Systems , which encompasses subsea projects services and drilling systems, surface pressure control, and flexible pipe systems. Beyond its traditional oilfield concentration, OFSE is expanding its capabilities and technology portfolio to meet the challenges of a net-zero future. These efforts include expanding into new energy areas such as geothermal and CCUS, strengthening its digital architecture and addressing key energy market themes. \n\nIndustrial &#38; Energy Technology provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors. IET also provides equipment, software, and services that serve a wide range of industries including petrochemical and refining, nuclear, aviation, automotive, mining, cement, metals, pulp and paper, and food and beverage. IET is organized into six product lines - Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services , collectively referred to as Gas Technology, and Condition Monitoring, Inspection, Pumps Valves &#38; Gears, and PSI &#38; Controls , collectively referred to as Industrial Technology. \n\nSegment revenue and operating income are determined based on the internal performance measures used by the CODM to assess the performance of each segment in a financial period. The performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, separation related costs, inventory impairments, goodwill impairments and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments. Consistent accounting policies have been applied by all segments, for all reporting periods. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. Summarized financial information for the Company's segments is shown in the following tables. \n\n##TABLE_START Segment revenue 2022 2021 2020 Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment $ 13,229 &#160; $ 12,028 &#160; $ 12,984 &#160; Industrial &#38; Energy Technology 7,926 &#160; 8,473 &#160; 7,721 &#160; Total $ 21,156 &#160; $ 20,502 &#160; $ 20,705 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 87 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n##TABLE_START Segment income (loss) before income taxes 2022 2021 2020 Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment $ 1,201 &#160; $ 830 &#160; $ 506 &#160; Industrial &#38; Energy Technology 1,135 &#160; 1,177 &#160; 998 &#160; Total segment 2,336 &#160; 2,006 &#160; 1,504 &#160; Corporate ( 416 ) ( 429 ) ( 464 ) \n\nInventory impairment (1) \n\n( 31 ) &#8212; &#160; ( 246 ) Goodwill impairment &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 14,773 ) Restructuring, impairment and other ( 682 ) ( 209 ) ( 1,866 ) Separation related ( 23 ) ( 60 ) ( 134 ) Other non-operating income (loss), net ( 911 ) ( 583 ) 1,040 &#160; Interest expense, net ( 252 ) ( 299 ) ( 264 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 22 &#160; $ 428 &#160; $ ( 15,202 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Inventory impairments are reported in the \"Cost of goods sold\" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nThe following table presents total assets by segment at December 31: \n\n##TABLE_START Segment assets 2022 2021 Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment $ 17,181 &#160; $ 17,950 &#160; Industrial &#38; Energy Technology 12,286 &#160; 11,480 &#160; Total segment 29,467 &#160; 29,430 &#160; \n\nCorporate and eliminations (1) \n\n4,714 &#160; 5,878 &#160; Total $ 34,181 &#160; $ 35,308 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The assets in Corporate and eliminations consist primarily of cash, the Baker Hughes trade name, our investment in C3 AI, certain facilities, and certain other noncurrent assets.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS \n\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WITH GE \n\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, GE's ownership interest in us and BHH LLC was reduced to less than 5 %. As a result, considering all aspects of our relationship with GE, as of June 30, 2022, we no longer consider GE a related party. Below we provide our disclosures for purchases and sales with GE through June 30, 2022. \n\nWe had purchases with GE and its affiliates of $ 293 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022, and $ 716 million and $ 804 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we sold products and services to GE and its affiliates for $ 83 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022, and, $ 185 million and $ 212 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nOTHER RELATED PARTIES \n\nWe have an aeroderivative joint venture (\"Aero JV\") we formed with GE in 2019. The Aero JV is jointly controlled by GE and us, each with ownership interest of 50 %, and therefore, we do not consolidate the JV. We had purchases with the Aero JV of $ 528 million, $ 603 million, and $ 642 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have $ 110 million and $ 86 million of accounts payable at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for products and services provided by the Aero JV in the ordinary course of business. Sales of products and services and related receivables with the Aero JV were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nNOTE 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nLITIGATION \n\nWe are subject to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Because legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters. We record a liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Based on the opinion of management, we do not expect the ultimate outcome of currently pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters. \n\nIn January 2013, INEOS and Naphtachimie initiated expertise proceedings in Aix-en-Provence, France arising out of a fire at a chemical plant owned by INEOS in Lavera, France, which resulted in a 15 -day plant shutdown and destruction of a steam turbine, which was part of a compressor train owned by Naphtachimie. The most recent quantification of the alleged damages is &#8364; 250 million. Two of the Company's subsidiaries (and 17 other companies) \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 89 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nwere notified to participate in the proceedings. On December 12, 2022, the expert issued his final report, which found no liability on the part of the Company's subsidiaries. \n\nOn July 31, 2018, International Engineering &#38; Construction S.A. (\"IEC\") initiated arbitration proceedings in New York administered by the International Center for Dispute Resolution (\"ICDR\") against the Company and its subsidiaries arising out of a series of sales and service contracts entered between IEC and the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries for the sale and installation of LNG plants and related power generation equipment in Nigeria (\"Contracts\"). Prior to the filing of the IEC Arbitration, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries made demands for payment due under the Contracts. On August 15, 2018, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due under the Contracts. On October 10, 2018, IEC filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company seeking to compel non-signatory Baker Hughes entities to participate in the arbitration filed by IEC. The complaint is captioned International Engineering &#38; Construction S.A. et al. v. Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC, et al. No. 18-cv-09241 (\"S.D.N.Y 2018\"); this action was dismissed by the Court on August 13, 2019. In the arbitration, IEC alleges breach of contract and other claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and seeks recovery of alleged compensatory damages, in addition to reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and arbitration costs. On March 15, 2019, IEC amended its request for arbitration to alleged damages of $ 591 million of lost profits plus unspecified additional costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute. The arbitration hearing was held from December 9, 2019 to December 20, 2019. On March 3, 2020, IEC amended their damages claim to $ 700 million of alleged loss cash flow or, in the alternative, $ 244.9 million of lost profits and various costs based on alleged non-performance of the contracts in dispute, and in addition $ 4.8 million of liquidated damages, $ 58.6 million in take-or-pay costs of feed gas, and unspecified additional costs of rectification and take-or-pay future obligations, plus unspecified interest and attorneys' fees. On May 3, 2020, the arbitration panel dismissed IEC's request for take-or-pay damages. On May 29, 2020, IEC quantified their claim for legal fees at $ 14.2 million and reduced their alternative claim from $ 244.9 million to approximately $ 235 million. The Company and its subsidiaries have contested IEC&#8217;s claims and are pursuing claims for compensation under the contracts. On October 31, 2020, the ICDR notified the arbitration panel&#8217;s final award, which dismissed the majority of IEC&#8217;s claims and awarded a portion of the Company&#8217;s claims. On January 27, 2021, IEC filed a petition to vacate the arbitral award in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York. On March 5, 2021, the Company filed a petition to confirm the arbitral award, and on March 8, 2021, the Company removed the matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On November 16, 2021, the court granted the Company's petition to confirm the award and denied IEC's petition to vacate. During the second quarter of 2022, IEC paid the amounts owed under the arbitration award, which had an immaterial impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. On February 3, 2022, IEC initiated another arbitration proceeding in New York administered by the ICDR against certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries arising out of the same project which formed the basis of the first arbitration. On March 25, 2022, the Company's subsidiaries initiated a separate demand for ICDR arbitration against IEC for claims of additional costs and amounts due. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these proceedings. \n\nOn March 15, 2019 and March 18, 2019, the City of Riviera Beach Pension Fund and Richard Schippnick, respectively, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery shareholder derivative lawsuits for and on the Company&#8217;s behalf against GE, the then-current members of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company as a nominal defendant, related to the decision to (i) terminate the contractual prohibition barring GE from selling any of the Company&#8217;s shares before July 3, 2019; (ii) repurchase $ 1.5 billion in the Company&#8217;s stock from GE; (iii) permit GE to sell approximately $ 2.5 billion in the Company&#8217;s stock through a secondary offering; and (iv) enter into a series of other agreements and amendments that will govern the ongoing relationship between the Company and GE (collectively, the &#8220;2018 Transactions&#8221;). The complaints in both lawsuits allege, among other things, that GE, as the Company&#8217;s controlling stockholder, and the members of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the 2018 Transactions. The relief sought in the complaints includes a request for a declaration that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, that GE was unjustly enriched, disgorgement of profits, an award of damages sustained by the Company, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On March 21, 2019, the Chancery Court entered an order consolidating the Schippnick and City of Riviera Beach complaints under consolidated C.A. No. 2019-0201-AGB, styled in re Baker Hughes, a GE company derivative litigation. On May 10, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the members of the Company&#8217;s Conflicts Committee, and on May 15, 2019, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against former Baker Hughes director Martin Craighead. On June 7, 2019, the defendants and nominal defendant filed a motion to \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 90 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\ndismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the derivative plaintiffs failed to make a demand on the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors to pursue the claims itself, and GE and the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The Chancery Court denied the motions on October 8, 2019, except granted GE&#8217;s motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim against it. On October 31, 2019, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors designated a Special Litigation Committee and empowered it with full authority to investigate and evaluate the allegations and issues raised in the derivative litigation. The Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to stay the derivative litigation during its investigation. On December 3, 2019, the Chancery Court granted the motion and stayed the derivative litigation until June 1, 2020. On May 20, 2020, the Chancery Court granted an extension of the stay to October 1, 2020, and on September 29, 2020, the Court granted a further extension of the stay to October 15, 2020. On October 13, 2020, the Special Litigation Committee filed its report with the Court. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of these claims. \n\nOn August 13, 2019, Tri-State Joint Fund filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, a shareholder class action lawsuit for and on the behalf of itself and all similarly situated public stockholders of BHI against GE, the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, and certain former BHI Officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and other claims in connection with the combination of BHI and the oil and gas business (\"GE O&#38;G\") of GE (\"the Transactions\"). On October 28, 2019, City of Providence filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery a shareholder class action lawsuit for and on behalf of itself and all similarly situated public shareholders of BHI against GE, the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, and certain former BHI Officers alleging substantially the same claims in connection with the Transactions. The relief sought in these complaints include a request for a declaration that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. The lawsuits have been consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint on December 17, 2019 against certain former BHI officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and against GE for aiding and abetting those breaches. The December 2019 complaint omitted the former members of the Board of Directors of BHI, except for Mr. Craighead who also served as President and CEO of BHI. Mr. Craighead and Ms. Ross, who served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BHI, remain named in the December 2019 complaint along with GE. The relief sought in the consolidated complaint includes a declaration that the former BHI officers breached their fiduciary duties and that GE aided and abetted those breaches, an award of damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On or around February 12, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. On or around October 27, 2020, the Chancery Court granted GE&#8217;s motion to dismiss, and granted in part the motion to dismiss filed by Mr. Craighead and Ms. Ross, thereby dismissing all of the claims against GE and Ms. Ross, and all but one of the claims against Mr. Craighead. At this time, we are not able to predict the outcome of the remaining claim. \n\nOn December 11, 2019, BMC Software, Inc. (&#8220;BMC&#8221;) filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Southern District of Texas against Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment, arising out of the Company&#8217;s use of its new logo and affiliated branding. On January 1, 2020, BMC amended its complaint to add Baker Hughes Company. The relief sought in the complaint includes a request for injunctive relief, an award of damages (including punitive damages), pre- and post-judgment interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. On or around January 27, 2023, the parties entered into a confidential Settlement Agreement. Any consideration contemplated by the Settlement Agreement is immaterial to the Company's financial statements. \n\nIn December 2020, the Company received notice that the SEC was conducting a formal investigation that the Company understands was related to its books and records and internal controls regarding sales of its products and services in projects impacted by U.S. sanctions. The Company cooperated with the SEC and provided requested information. The Company also initiated an internal review with the assistance of external legal counsel regarding internal controls and compliance related to U.S. sanctions requirements. While the Company's review was ongoing, in September 2021, the Company voluntarily informed the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") that non-U.S. Baker Hughes affiliates in two foreign countries appear to have received payments, involving U.S. touchpoints, that are subject to debt restrictions pursuant to applicable U.S. sanctions laws. In February 2022, OFAC informed the Company that it has issued a cautionary letter and that it will not pursue a civil monetary penalty or further enforcement action. The cautionary letter reflects OFAC&#8217;s final enforcement response to the Company&#8217;s voluntary self-disclosure. The Company provided copies of its correspondence with OFAC to the SEC. On January 12, 2023, \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 91 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nthe Company was notified that the SEC had concluded its investigation and does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company. \n\nWe insure against risks arising from our business to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending or future legal proceedings or other claims. Most of our insurance policies contain deductibles or self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable, measurable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS \n\nItem 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. The Company uses a threshold of $ 1 million for such proceedings. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period. \n\nEstimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and enacted laws and regulations. Our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. Accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such costs can be reasonably estimated. As additional information becomes available, accruals are adjusted to reflect current cost estimates. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining or renewing environmental permits, installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred. Where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in a U.S. federal or state Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"Superfund\") site, we accrue our share, if known, of the estimated remediation costs of the site. This share is based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site. \n\nOTHER \n\nIn the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees. We also provide a guarantee to GE Capital on behalf of a customer who entered into a financing arrangement with GE Capital. Total off-balance sheet arrangements were approximately $ 4.5 billion at December 31, 2022. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. As of December 31, 2022, none of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also had commitments outstanding for purchase obligations for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2027 of $ 1,584 million, $ 377 million, $ 267 million, $ 119 million and $ 113 million, respectively, and $ 31 million in the aggregate thereafter. \n\nWe sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects primarily in our OFSE segment. Under such arrangements, each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work, and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed. The failure or inability, financially or otherwise, of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us. These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project, liquidated damages or contract disputes. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 92 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNOTE 20. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER \n\nWe recorded restructuring, impairment and other charges of $ 682 million, $ 209 million, and $ 1,866 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nRESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES \n\nIn 2022, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $ 196 million. In the third quarter of 2022, we announced a restructuring plan in conjunction with a change in our operating segments that was effective October 1, 2022. As a result, we incurred charges primarily related to employee termination expenses driven by actions taken by the Company to facilitate the reorganization into two segments. In addition, property, plant and equipment (\"PP&#38;E\") impairments and other costs were recorded related to exit activities at specific locations in our OFSE segment to align with our current market outlook and rationalize our manufacturing supply chain footprint. See \"Note 17. Segment Information\" for further information on the change in segments. We expect to incur additional charges of approximately $ 100 million in 2023 in connection with our restructuring plan initiated in 2022, and currently expect this plan to come to completion by the end of 2023. \n\nIn 2021, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $ 138 million. Charges incurred were primarily related to the continuation of our overall strategy to restructure our business, which is designed to optimize our structural costs for the year-over-year change in activity levels and market conditions. \n\nIn 2020, in response to the impact on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant decline in oil and gas prices, we recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $ 903 million. Charges incurred were primarily related to rationalizing certain product lines and restructuring our business to right-size our operations and to address the challenging market conditions in the upstream oil and gas market. \n\nThe following table presents the restructuring and impairment charges by the impacted segment, however, these charges are not included in the reported segment results. \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Oilfield Services &#38; Equipment $ 121 &#160; $ 121 &#160; $ 800 &#160; Industrial &#38; Energy Technology 36 &#160; 11 &#160; 89 &#160; Corporate 39 &#160; 6 &#160; 14 &#160; Total $ 196 &#160; $ 138 &#160; $ 903 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table presents restructuring and impairment charges by type: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Property, plant and equipment $ 58 &#160; $ 7 &#160; $ 385 &#160; Employee-related termination expenses 121 &#160; 99 &#160; 464 &#160; Asset relocation costs 3 &#160; 20 &#160; 15 &#160; Contract termination fees 1 &#160; 2 &#160; 23 &#160; Other incremental costs 13 &#160; 10 &#160; 16 &#160; Total $ 196 &#160; $ 138 &#160; $ 903 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOTHER CHARGES \n\nOther charges included in the \"Restructuring, impairment and other\" caption in the consolidated statements of income (loss) were $ 486 million, $ 71 million, and $ 963 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nIn 2022, other charges were primarily associated with our Russia operations. As a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February of 2022, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries enacted sanctions against Russia and certain Russian interests. On March 19, 2022, we \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 93 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nsuspended any new investments in our Russia operations, but continued to comply with applicable laws and regulations as we fulfilled contractual obligations. Over the course of the second quarter of 2022, we closely monitored the developments in Ukraine and Russia and changes to sanctions all of which continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging. As a result, in the second quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to sell part of our OFSE Russia business. The sale was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. See &#8220;Note 21. Business Dispositions and Acquisitions&#8221; for further information. In addition, given that some of our activities are prohibited under applicable sanctions and almost all of our activities are unsustainable in the current environment, we took actions to suspend substantially all of our operational activities related to Russia. These actions resulted in other charges of $ 334 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 primarily associated with the suspension of contracts including all our IET LNG contracts, and the impairment of assets consisting primarily of contract assets, PP&#38;E and reserve for accounts receivable. In addition to these charges, we recorded inventory impairments of $ 31 million primarily in IET as a result of suspending our Russia operations, which are reported in the &#8220;Cost of goods sold&#8221; caption in the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\nDuring 2022, we also recorded other charges of $ 84 million in our OFSE segment primarily related to the impairment of PP&#38;E and intangibles for the SPS business due to a decrease in the estimated future cash flows driven by a decline in our long-term market outlook for this business, and $ 68 million in our IET segment primarily related to a write-off of an equity method investment and the release of foreign currency translation adjustments. \n\nIn 2021, other charges were primarily related to certain litigation matters in our IET segment and the release of foreign currency translation adjustments for certain restructured product lines in our IET segment. \n\nIn 2020, other charges were comprised of intangible asset impairments of $ 605 million driven by our decision to exit certain businesses primarily in our OFSE segment, other long-lived asset impairments of $ 216 million ($ 124 million of intangible assets, $ 77 million of property, plant and equipment and $ 15 million of other assets) in our OFSE segment, other charges of $ 73 million driven by certain litigation matters and the impairment of an equity method investment primarily in corporate and the OFSE segment, and charges related to corporate facility rationalization. \n\nNOTE 21. BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND ACQUISITIONS \n\nDISPOSITIONS \n\nWe completed several business dispositions over the past three years as described below. Any gain or loss on a business disposition is reported in the \" Other non-operating income (loss), net \" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). \n\n&#8226; During the second quarter of 2022, we took actions to suspend substantially all of our operational activities related to Russia across the Company. In addition, we committed to a plan to sell part of our OFSE Russia business, which met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and was measured and reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell which resulted in a loss before income taxes of $ 426 million. In November 2022, we completed the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business to local management for a nominal amount, which resulted in the recognition of an additional loss before income taxes of $ 25 million. \n\n&#8226; In October 2021, we closed a transaction with Akastor ASA to create a joint venture company (\"JV Company\") to deliver global offshore drilling solutions. We contributed our subsea drilling systems business, a division of our OFSE segment, to the JV Company and received as consideration 50 % of the shares of the JV Company, cash of $ 70 million, and a promissory note of $ 80 million. The transaction resulted in an immaterial gain. \n\n&#8226; In October 2020, we completed the sale of our surface pressure control flow business, a non-strategic product line in our OFSE segment that provided surface wellhead and surface tree systems for the onshore market. The sale resulted in a loss before income taxes of $ 137 million. \n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 94 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\n&#8226; In June 2020, we completed the sale of our rod lift systems (\"RLS\") business. RLS was part of our OFSE segment and provided rod lift products, technologies, services and solutions to the oil and gas industry. The sale resulted in a loss before income taxes of $ 216 million. \n\nACQUISITIONS \n\n&#8226; During 2022, we completed several acquisitions for total cash consideration of $ 767 million, net of cash acquired of $ 50 million, subject to the finalization of post-closing working capital adjustments. The transactions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $ 458 million of goodwill and $ 211 million of intangible assets. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n\nNOTE 22. BUSINESS HELD FOR SALE \n\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale (&#8220;disposal group&#8221;) when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group and concludes that it meets the relevant criteria. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from the measurement is recognized in the period the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized until the date of sale. \n\nIn July 2022, we entered into an agreement with GE to sell Nexus Controls, a business in our IET segment, specializing in scalable industrial controls systems, safety systems, hardware, and software cybersecurity solutions and services. Based on preliminary estimates, the carrying value is expected to approximate the fair value of the business, less costs to sell. We expect to complete the sale in mid-2023 subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals. \n\nThe following table presents financial information related to the assets and liabilities of our Nexus Controls business classified as held for sale and reported in &#8220;All other current assets&#8221; and &#8220;All other current liabilities&#8221; in our consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Assets and liabilities of business held for sale Nexus Controls Assets Current receivables $ 59 &#160; Inventories 36 &#160; Property, plant and equipment 2 &#160; Goodwill 230 &#160; Other assets 10 &#160; Total assets of business held for sale 337 &#160; Liabilities Accounts payable 30 &#160; All other current liabilities 56 &#160; Other liabilities 7 &#160; Total liabilities of business held for sale 93 &#160; Total net assets of business held for sale $ 244 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nBaker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 95 \n\nBaker Hughes Company \n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nNOTE 23.
