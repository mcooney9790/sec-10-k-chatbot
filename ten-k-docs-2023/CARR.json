      "text": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\nGeneral \n\nCarrier Global Corporation is the leading global provider of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions with a focus on providing differentiated, digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions to our customers. Our portfolio includes industry-leading brands such as Carrier, Toshiba, Automated Logic, Carrier Transicold, Kidde, Edwards and LenelS2 that offer innovative heating, ventilating and air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), refrigeration, fire, security and building automation technologies to help make the world safer and more comfortable. We also provide a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance and monitoring. \n\nOur worldwide operations are affected by global and regional industrial, economic and political factors and trends. These include the mega-trends of urbanization, climate change and increasing requirements for food safety driven by the food needs of a growing global population and the rising standards of living in emerging markets. We believe that our business segments are well positioned to benefit from favorable secular trends, including these mega-trends and from the strength of our industry-leading brands and track record of innovation. In addition, we regularly review our end markets to proactively identify trends and adapt our strategies accordingly. \n\nOur operations are classified into three segments: HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire &#38; Security. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net sales were $20.4 billion and our operating profit was $4.5 billion. Our net sales for 2022 were derived from the Americas (60%), Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") (23%) and Asia-Pacific (17%). Our international operations, including U.S. export sales, represented approximately 45% of our net sales for 2022. During the same period, new equipment comprised 77% and parts and service comprised 23% of our net sales. \n\n##TABLE_START Sales by Segment * Net Sales by Region Sales by Type ##TABLE_END\n\n* Segment sales include inter-company sales. \n\nAcquisition of Toshiba Carrier Corporation \n\nOn February 6, 2022, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire a majority ownership interest in Toshiba Carrier Corporation (&#8220;TCC&#8221;), a variable refrigerant flow (\"VRF\") and light commercial HVAC joint venture between Carrier and Toshiba Corporation. TCC designs and manufactures flexible, energy-efficient and high-performance VRF and light commercial HVAC systems as well as commercial products, compressors and heat pumps. The acquisition included all of TCC's advanced research and development centers and global manufacturing operations, product pipeline and the long-term use of Toshiba's iconic brand. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2022 and reported within our HVAC segment. Upon closing, Toshiba Corporation retained a 5% ownership interest in TCC. \n\nSale of Chubb Fire and Security Business \n\nOn July 26, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell our Chubb Fire and Security business (\"Chubb\") to APi Group Corporation (\"APi\"). Chubb, which was reported within our Fire &#38; Security segment, delivered essential fire safety and security solutions from design and installation to monitoring, service and maintenance across more than 17 countries around the globe. On January 3, 2022, we completed the sale of Chubb (the \"Chubb Sale\") for net proceeds of $2.9 billion and recognized a gain on the sale of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nSeparation from United Technologies Corporation \n\nOn April 3, 2020 (the \"Distribution Date\"), United Technologies Corporation, since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation (\"UTC\") completed the spin-off of Carrier into an independent publicly traded company (the \"Separation\") through a pro rata distribution (the \"Distribution\") on a one-for-one basis of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Carrier to UTC shareowners. In connection with the Separation, we issued an aggregate principal balance of $11.0 billion of debt and transferred approximately $10.9 billion of cash to UTC on February 27, 2020 and March 27, 2020. In addition, we entered into several agreements with UTC and Otis Worldwide Corporation (\"Otis\") that govern various aspects of the relationship among us, UTC and Otis following the Separation and the Distribution. As of December 31, 2022, only the Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\") remains in effect. On April 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, we received cash contributions totaling $590 million from UTC related to the Separation. \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\nOur business strategy is to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions with a focus on providing differentiated, digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions to our customers. We believe our strategy is supported by a variety of favorable secular trends, including health and wellness, sustainability, digitalization and a growing middle class. In order to execute our business strategy, we are focused on three pillars of growth: \n\nStrengthen and Grow our Core. Our strategy involves driving organic growth in part by maintaining our proven track record of innovation, which is focused on designing smarter, more connected and more sustainable systems and solutions. Our strategy also relies on our iconic, industry-leading brands and on strengthening our long-term relationships with channel partners and customers by offering solutions that anticipate customer needs with a focus on technologies related to environmentally-friendly refrigerants, energy efficiency, low emissions, air quality, electrification, noise reduction and safety. In addition, we continue to actively manage and strengthen our business and product portfolio to meet the current and future needs of our customers. This is driven by sustaining activities with a focus on improving existing products and reducing production costs. We also pursue potential acquisitions to complement existing products and services to enhance our product portfolio. \n\nIncrease Product Extensions and Geographic Coverage. Our strategy involves leveraging our global operations, the strength of our iconic, industry-leading brands and our success in creating valuable partnerships to focus on targeted expansion into new locations and channels where we believe that we can drive profitable growth. These drivers are supported by research and development activities with a focus on new product development and new technology innovation. We also pursue potential acquisitions to enter new locations and channels as well as expand and enhance our current product portfolio. In addition, we launched Carrier Ventures, a global venture capital group which focuses on investments to accelerate the development of sustainable innovations and disruptive technologies to transform future building and cold chain management. The group engages in strategic partnerships with high growth organizations as they invest in the development of technologies to innovate and commercialize the next generation of differentiated net zero solutions. \n\nGrow Aftermarket and Digital. Our strategy is focused on digital capabilities to drive the evolution of our hardware in order to enable cloud connectivity, modernize legacy software and launch new platforms, products and services. We expect that these solutions will increase our total available market opportunity, enhance our predictive service and maintenance capabilities, strengthen our customer intimacy as well as fuel our aftermarket growth. Abound is a cloud-based building platform that unlocks and unites building data to create more healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent solutions for indoor spaces. It gathers data from disparate systems, sensors and sources; identifies opportunities to optimize performance; and works with healthy building solutions to improve occupant experiences. Our Lynx digital platform, developed in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (&#8220;AWS&#8221;), allows customers to leverage data to enhance visibility, resiliency, agility and efficiency in the cold chain to reduce loss and support real-time decisions. In addition, our product teams are deriving insights from data by employing AWS for connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Most recently, we signed a multi-year, strategic collaboration \n\nagreement with AWS to offer additional Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") solutions in the areas of HVAC performance, sustainability and safety and security. The collaboration is part of our growing investment in digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions designed to inspire confidence in the health and safety of indoor environments. \n\nOur industry-leading global brands and track record of innovation form the foundation of our business strategy. This strategy is fueled by our position at the epicenter of important secular trends, including an emphasis on health and wellness, a growing focus on sustainability and increasing digitalization. Coupled with our focus on growth, innovation and operational efficiency, we expect to drive long-term growth and increased value for our shareowners. \n\nBusiness Segments \n\nWe globally manage our business operations through three segments: HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire &#38; Security. Each respective segment's major products, services and distribution methods are as follows: \n\nHVAC. The HVAC segment provides products, controls, services and solutions to meet the heating, cooling and ventilation needs of residential and commercial customers while enhancing building performance, health, energy efficiency and sustainability. Our established brands include Carrier, Toshiba, Automated Logic, Bryant, CIAT, Day &#38; Night, Heil, NORESCO and Riello which offer an innovative and complete portfolio of products that provide numerous solutions for our customers. Products include air conditioners, heating systems, heat pumps, controls and aftermarket components as well as aftermarket repair and maintenance services and building automation systems. Some of these products are part of Carrier&#8217;s Healthy Buildings Program, which offers a suite of targeted solutions that are focused on improving and optimizing indoor air quality in buildings and homes to enhance human health, safety and productivity. Products and solutions are sold directly to building contractors and owners and indirectly through joint ventures, independent sales representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retail outlets. \n\nRefrigeration. The Refrigeration segment provides a healthier, safer, more sustainable and more intelligent cold chain through the reliable transport and preservation of food, medicine and other perishable cargo. Products and services are sold under established brand names, including Carrier Commercial Refrigeration, Carrier Transicold and Sensitech. Our refrigeration and monitoring products, services and digital solutions, which form Carrier's Connected Cold Chain offering, strengthen the connected cold chain and are designed for trucks, trailers, shipping containers, intermodal applications, food retail and warehouse cooling. Commercial refrigeration solutions include refrigerated cabinets, freezers, systems and controls which incorporate next-generation technologies to preserve freshness, ensure safety and enhance the appearance of food and beverages sold by retailers. Products and services are sold directly to transportation companies and retail stores and indirectly through joint ventures, independent sales representatives, distributors, wholesalers and dealers. \n\nFire &#38; Security. The Fire &#38; Security segment provides a wide range of residential, commercial and industrial technologies designed to help protect people and property. Our established brands include Kidde, Edwards, GST, LenelS2, Marioff, Autronica, Aritech, Det-Tronics, Onity, Supra and Fireye which provide product and technology innovations that are supported by installation, maintenance and monitoring through a network of channel partners and our own field service business, along with web-based and mobile applications and cloud-based services. Products include fire, flame, gas, smoke and carbon monoxide detection, portable fire extinguishers, fire suppression systems, intruder alarms, access control systems and video management systems and electronic controls. Other fire and security service offerings include audit, design, installation and system integration as well as aftermarket maintenance and repair and monitoring services. Our fire and security products and solutions, also part of Carrier's Healthy Homes and Healthy Buildings Programs, are sold directly to end customers as well as through manufacturers&#8217; representatives, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers and retail distribution. \n\nOther Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole \n\nCompetitive Conditions \n\nEach of our businesses is subject to significant competition from a number of companies throughout the world. Due to the nature of our products and services and the markets we serve, our competition can vary from regional or specialized companies to larger public or private companies. \n\nThe most significant competitive factors we face are technology differentiation, product performance, service, delivery schedule and price. Brand reputation, service to customers and quality are also important competitive factors for our products and services. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we are a significant competitor with respect to \n\neach of our major product and service offerings. We believe that the loss of any individual contract or customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results. \n\nRaw Materials and Supplies \n\nWe rely on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials such as copper, aluminum and steel. In addition, we also use semi-conductors and other electronic components in the manufacture of our products. To maximize our buying effectiveness and leverage our scale, we have a central strategic sourcing group that consolidates purchases of certain materials and components across our business segments. \n\nThe ongoing global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures, component shortages and transportation delays. As a result, we have incurred incremental costs for commodities and components used in our products as well as component shortages and higher freight costs that have negatively impacted our sales and results of operations. We expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future. \n\nWe continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in our operations and supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components and localized manufacturing when feasible. To date, there has been moderate disruption to the availability of our products, though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if these supply chain challenges continue. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nWe maintain a broad portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our business to protect our research and development investments and to maintain our competitive advantages. We hold approximately 9,000 active patents and pending patent applications worldwide. From time to time, we take actions to protect our business by asserting our intellectual property rights against third-party infringement. We believe that we have taken reasonable measures to build and protect this portfolio of intellectual property rights, but we cannot be assured that these rights will not be challenged, found invalid or unenforceable. \n\nOperating System \n\nWe plan to continue to foster operational, financial and commercial excellence to drive sales and earnings growth. With roots in our legacy manufacturing and business processes, the Carrier operating system &#8212; Carrier Excellence &#8212; is our continuous improvement framework that is expected to drive operational excellence across our businesses. Our Supplier Excellence program is intended to apply these same operating principles to our supply base and we continue to focus on strategic cost reductions through operational efficiency, digitalization, automation and supply chain productivity. These efforts have helped reduce the impact of inflationary pressures experienced during 2022 and 2021. \n\nJoint Ventures and Strategic Relationships \n\nOur joint ventures and strategic relationships are an important part of our business. We hold direct ownership interests in approximately 47 joint ventures, the financial results of which are accounted for by the equity method of accounting or the cost basis of accounting, of which 99% of such investments are in our HVAC segment. These relationships engage in distribution, manufacturing and product development activities and are integral to our business operations and growth strategy. \n\nSeasonality \n\nDemand for certain of our products and services is seasonal and can be impacted by weather conditions. For instance, sales and services of our HVAC products to residential customers have historically been higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, which represent the peak seasons for air conditioning-related sales in North America markets. A change in building and remodeling activity also can affect our financial performance. In addition, our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment, including truck production cycles in North America and Europe. \n\nCompliance with the Regulation of our Business and Operations \n\nWe operate our businesses and sell our products all over the world. As a result, rapid changes in legislation, regulations and government policies, including with respect to regulations intended to combat climate change, affect our operations and business in the countries, regions and localities in which we operate and sell our products. International accords such as the Paris Agreement and the subsequent U.S. climate policies to meet its nationally determined contributions as well as local regulations in the U.S. reducing the use of fossil fuels in buildings all have the potential to impact our products and service offerings. Such changes, which can render our products and technologies non-compliant, involve refrigerants, noise levels, product and fire safety, hydrofluorocarbon emissions, fluorinated gases, hazardous substances and electric and electronic equipment waste. Increased fragmentation of regulatory requirements changes the manner in which we conduct our business and increases our costs because it necessitates the development of country or regional specific variants, monitoring of and compliance with those regulations and additional testing and certifications. In addition, our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and by authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, capital expenditures to design and upgrade our products to comply with or exceed environmental and other regulations and energy efficiency standards. However, it is our opinion that the costs related to compliance requirements for environmental or other government regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, financial results or competitive position. \n\nEnvironmental Goals \n\nAs a leading global provider of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions, we are committed to making the world safer, sustainable and more comfortable. We have set ambitious environmental, social and governance goals to be reached by 2030, which include the following: \n\n&#8226; Invest over $2 billion to develop healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions that incorporate sustainable design principles and reduce lifecycle impacts, \n\n&#8226; Reduce our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton, \n\n&#8226; Achieve carbon neutral operations, \n\n&#8226; Reduce energy intensity by 10% across our operations, \n\n&#8226; Achieve water neutrality in our operations, prioritizing water-scarce locations, and \n\n&#8226; Promote sustainability through education, partnerships and climate resiliency programs. \n\nHuman Capital Management \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Carrier had approximately 52,000 employees worldwide, of which 39% are located in the Americas, 25% are located in EMEA and 36% are located in Asia. As of December 31, 2022, in the U.S., approximately 66% of Carrier's approximately 5,000 production and maintenance employees were covered under six collective bargaining agreements that have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2026. In the European Union, approximately 12,000 employees are represented by two European Works Councils and, at national and local levels, we inform and consult with 46 local works councils and with unions representing employees at approximately 40 sites. We believe that our relations with our labor unions and works councils are generally good. \n\nWe believe that our employees are our most important asset and that, in turn, our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We continuously evaluate, modify and enhance our recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives. \n\nHealth &#38; Safety. Our Environmental, Health and Safety program is focused on eliminating the risk of serious injuries, illness and fatalities to employees, contractors and customers during manufacturing, installation, servicing and other business activities. We apply rigorous standards, controls, inspections and audits to help ensure that our operations and premises comply with national and local regulations and Carrier incident reporting requirements. For 2022, our total recordable incident rate (\"TRIR\"), based upon the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked for our employees was 0.31 and our lost time incident rate (\"LTIR\") was 0.12. \n\nIn response to COVID-19, we implemented various measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including work-from-home requirements (where practical), social distancing and deep cleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions, among other measures, which comply with applicable governmental regulations and guidance. \n\nCompetitive Pay, Benefits and Total Rewards and Practices. Carrier's total rewards philosophy is designed to align the compensation of our employees with individual and Company performance, and to provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. In addition, we offer a company-paid assistance program to help employees and their families with mental health and other life challenges. In coordination with each country&#8217;s social welfare system, and in addition to any required local health care participation, we may provide additional health and welfare benefits depending on, among other things, the market competitiveness in that country. We also offer a tuition assistance program that is discussed in more detail below (see Talent Development and Employee Engagement ). \n\nInclusion &#38; Diversity. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 29% of our employees and 30% of our executives globally were women. As of December 31, 2022, people of color represented approximately 31% of our U.S. executive and 26% of our professional employees in the U.S. \n\nOur greatest strength is the diversity of our people and their ideas and experiences; inclusion and diversity are the cornerstones of our values and we believe that it is a source of innovation. To this end, we continue to promote _belong , our inclusion and diversity philosophy and brand as well as an inclusion and diversity strategy that consists of four tenets &#8211; Reduce the Gap, Develop &#38; Sponsor, Drive Inclusion and Lean Forward &#8211; which include a focus on recruitment, development and mentoring activities. We also sponsor multiple Employee Resource Groups (\"ERGs\"), such as Pride, Carrier Black Alliance, WE (Women's Empowerment at Carrier), CHEER (Carrier Hispanic &#38; Latino Employee Engagement Resource group), UCAN (United Carrier Asian Network) and Military and Veterans. These ERGs operate with a formal leadership structure, a steering committee, senior leadership sponsorship and a defined mission statement that is aligned with supporting Carrier&#8217;s business strategy. We also have established multi-year relationships with two historically Black colleges and universities to create programs to help students develop skills for the future and provide career and recruitment initiatives. \n\nWe continue to take steps to expand our role as an employer that champions inclusion, diversity and equality of opportunity. Carrier has pledged to achieve gender parity in senior leadership roles by 2030. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") has signed the CEO Action for Diversity &#38; Inclusion TM pledge joining more than 2,000 CEOs to underscore our commitment to ensure inclusion is core to our business culture. Our senior management has also signed the Hispanic Promise, joining other Fortune 500 companies in the pledge to hire, retain and develop Hispanics in the workplace. Additionally, we continue to provide our global workforce with inclusion and diversity training with a focus on unconscious bias, micro-aggression and allyship. \n\nWhile we recognize more work needs to be done, we are proud of the strides we have made and the recognition we have received in furthering our inclusion and diversity strategy. In 2021, Carrier participated for the first time in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2021 Corporate Equality Index and achieved a perfect score being recognized Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. Carrier earned the same recognition in 2022. Carrier also participated for the first time in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation&#8217;s 2022 Corporate Equality Index in Mexico and achieved a perfect score being recognized as Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality in Mexico. \n\nTalent Development and Employee Engagement. We are committed to the continued development and engagement of our people. We promote continuous learning by offering a company-sponsored Employee Scholar Program, which covers the cost of an employee's tuition, academic fees and books at approved universities. We conduct annual leadership development reviews, a process through which senior leaders identify future leaders and discuss strengths and development opportunities, fostering succession planning for key leadership positions. We also have developed various talent development programs, such as internships, early career rotational programs and a suite of development programs for current and future leaders during the three critical stages of their careers &#8211; early career, mid-career and senior leadership. \n\nThree-times per year we conduct a confidential online survey in local languages to solicit feedback from our employees. The results are reviewed by our senior leadership and shared with our managers and other employees who collaborate to act on identified areas of improvement. \n\nCorporate Information \n\nCarrier was incorporated in Delaware in connection with the Separation on March 15, 2019. Our principal executive offices are located at 13995 Pasteur Boulevard, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida 33418, and our telephone number is (561) 365-2000.

      "text": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \n\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY \n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\n&#8226; Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19. \n\n&#8226; Risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\n&#8226; We are party to joint ventures and other strategic relationships, which may not be successful and may expose us to unique risks and restrictions. \n\n&#8226; Climate change, regulations associated with climate change and mitigation efforts could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#8226; Demand for our HVAC products and services is influenced by weather conditions and seasonality. \n\n&#8226; Our business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, which may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. \n\n&#8226; Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. \n\n&#8226; We depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers. Infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. \n\n&#8226; We use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts and third-party service providers in our business. The ability of suppliers to deliver parts, components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our business performance. Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions, price increases or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. \n\n&#8226; We design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. \n\n&#8226; We operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services. \n\n&#8226; Customers and others may take disruptive actions. \n\n&#8226; Labor matters may impact our business. \n\n&#8226; Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results. \n\n&#8226; We may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, and our profitability or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. \n\n&#8226; Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results. \n\n&#8226; We are subject to litigation, environmental and other legal and compliance risks. \n\n&#8226; We are subject to risks arising from doing business with the U.S. government. \n\n&#8226; We engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. \n\n&#8226; We may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and intangible assets. \n\n&#8226; Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. \n\n&#8226; We incurred debt obligations, and we may incur additional debt obligations in the future, which could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations. \n\nRisks Related to the Separation from UTC \n\n&#8226; After the Separation and the Distribution, certain members of management, directors and shareowners own stock in UTC, Carrier and Otis and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest. \n\n&#8226; In connection with the Separation into three independent public companies, each of UTC, Carrier and Otis has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay UTC and/or Otis under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Also, the UTC or Otis indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which UTC and Otis have been allocated responsibility, and UTC and/or Otis may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future. \n\n&#8226; In certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify UTC for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the TMA. \n\n&#8226; Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock \n\n&#8226; The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. \n\n&#8226; Shareowner's percentage of ownership in Carrier's common stock may be diluted in the future. \n\n&#8226; Quarterly cash dividends may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. \n\n&#8226; Our amended and restated bylaws designate the courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareowners, which could discourage lawsuits against Carrier and our directors and officers. \n\n&#8226; Anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board of Directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\n&#8226; Natural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and may not be fully covered by insurance. \n\n&#8226; We may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure industries in particular. \n\n&#8226; Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. \n\n&#8226; Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. \n\n&#8226; Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us. \n\nRISK FACTORS \n\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth subsequently, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19. \n\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 severely constrained economic activity and caused a significant contraction in the global economy. In response to this outbreak, governments took preventive or protective actions, including imposing restrictions on business operations and travel. Governments also implemented economic stabilization efforts and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak; however, the effectiveness and continuation of those measures remains uncertain. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The pandemic resulted in widespread and extended or partial shutdowns and other restrictions on the operations of non-essential businesses, specifically due to resurgence in cases and the spread of variants, including construction, hospitality venues, offices and travel. The nature and extent of the continuing impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the emergence, severity and spread of COVID-19 variants. Nonetheless, further prolonged closures and restrictions throughout the world due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and decreases in the general level of economic activity may again disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, distributors and customers. \n\nAs a result of the foregoing, the pandemic and its impact have also affected and could continue to affect our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and parts, ship finished products to customers, the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services and to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease and/or cancellation of orders and/or payment delays or defaults. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. Facility closures or other restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff, supply or otherwise maintain our operations. Further, such conditions may also adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at the anticipated cost. We also may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our results of operations and our credit ratings. There is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, labor shortages due to prolonged illness or quarantine or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations. \n\nRecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact. Further, many of the factors discussed under Risk Factors in this Form 10-K are, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nRisks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nApproximately 45% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 are derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. As a result, changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuating exchange rates, may adversely affect demand for our products and the profits generated by our non-U.S. operations because a significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. While we attempt to manage our exchange rate risks, we are not completely insulated from that exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could reduce our operating margins in various locations outside of the U.S., which would adversely impact the comparability of our results from period to period. \n\nOur international sales and operations are also subject to the risks associated with changes in local government regulations and policies regarding investments, employment, taxation, foreign exchange and capital controls and the repatriation of earnings. Moreover, government regulations and policies regarding international trade, such as import quotas, punitive taxes or tariffs or similar trade barriers, whether imposed by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or services or encumber our ability to manufacture or sell or procure products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies by the U.S. or by other countries, such as China and Mexico, where we sell or produce our products and services or procure materials, including as a result of the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to political and economic instability, changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets, and the risks associated with differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. \n\nWe expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as developing nations around the world increase their demand for our products. In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Mexico, Brazil, China, India and countries in the Middle East. Emerging markets can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), compliance risks, economic and government instability, exchange rate fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nWe are party to joint ventures and other strategic relationships, which may not be successful and may expose us to unique risks and restrictions. \n\nOur business operations, particularly in our HVAC segment, depend on various strategic relationships, namely, joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries. We sell our products and services through certain key distributor, joint venture and similar relationships, including the Carrier Enterprise joint ventures with Watsco, Inc., AHI-Carrier FZC, a United Arab Emirates-based joint venture and various joint ventures with members of the Midea Group. \n\nSome of our strategic relationships engage in manufacturing and/or product development. Loss of a key channel partner, or a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key channel partner, joint venture or similar relationship, whether related to, among other things, a labor strike, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for products or delays in the launch of new products, could adversely affect our results of operations in a particular period or the value of our equity investment. If we are not successful in maintaining our strategic distribution relationships, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to our minority-held joint ventures is limited and can expose us to additional financial and reputational risks. We seek to take proactive steps to mitigate these concerns, including through audits and similar reviews. \n\nJoint ventures and strategic relationships inherently involve certain other risks. Whether or not we hold a majority interest or maintain operational control in such arrangements, our partners and similar business associates may, for example: (1) have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with or contrary to our own; (2) exercise veto or other rights, to the extent available, to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture&#8217;s best interests; (3) act contrary to our policies or objectives; or (4) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations. \n\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that any particular joint venture or strategic relationship will continue to be beneficial to us in the long term. For example, some of our joint ventures or other strategic agreements prohibit us from competing in certain geographic markets or product and services channels, and these restrictions may apply to other products and services we develop or businesses we acquire in the future. \n\nClimate change, regulations associated with climate change and mitigation efforts could adversely affect our business. \n\nThe effects of climate change, including increased frequency and intensity of weather conditions and water scarcity, create financial risks to our business. The potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present; for example rising sea levels at certain of our facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. The effects of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs. The effects of climate \n\nchange also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. Potential adverse impacts from climate change may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours. \n\nThere is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects. Increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to: (1) generate more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants (e.g. the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and the American Innovation and Manufacturing (\"AIM\") Act of 2020, which are essential to many of our products); (2) increase building energy and cold chain efficiency; and (3) cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, including natural gas prohibitions. In some instances, these requirements may render our existing technology, particularly some of our HVAC and refrigeration products, non-compliant or obsolete and we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to meet new regulations and standards, changing interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations. Furthermore, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preferences that we may not be able to timely meet due to our required level of capital investment and technology advancement. While we are committed to pursuing sustainable solutions for our products, there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position, or that economic returns will justify our investments in new product development. \n\nThe inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations, such as the U.S. re-entrance into the Paris Climate Agreement, also create economic and regulatory uncertainty. There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued, could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance. \n\nWe have set environmental, social and governance goals to be achieved by 2030, which include investing over $2 billion to develop healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions that incorporate sustainable design principles and reduce lifecycle impacts, reducing our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton, achieving carbon neutral operations and reducing energy intensity by 10% across our operations. Although we intend to meet these goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our goals will be achieved, or that any future expenditures or investments we make in furtherance of achieving such goals will be available, effective, meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. For example, to make substantial progress toward or to meet some of these goals, we may need to purchase or deploy a combination of renewable energy utility contracts, carbon credits or offsets, energy-efficient or low-emission products or operations, or carbon sequestration technologies, and there can be no assurance of the extent to which such contracts, credits, offsets, products, operations or technologies will be available or effective in reducing emissions or energy intensity. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and our shareowners to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainability investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to make substantial progress toward or meet these goals, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations. \n\nDemand for our HVAC products and services is influenced by weather conditions and seasonality. \n\nDemand for our HVAC products and services, representing our largest segment by sales, is seasonal and affected by the weather. Cooler than normal summers depress sales of our replacement air conditioning products and services and warmer than normal winters have the same effect on our heating products. Historically, sales to residential HVAC customers tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because, in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere regions, spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. In these circumstances, the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year, and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect our business and impact overall results of operations. \n\nOur business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure, which may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. \n\nThe efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure systems. The failure to design, develop, maintain and implement IT technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to maintain these systems could divert management&#8217;s attention and resources. Our information systems may also become obsolete because of inadequate investments, requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming, costly, and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management attention. Repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of poor execution, inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services. \n\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. \n\nOur business has been and may again in the future be impacted by disruptions to our or third-party IT infrastructure, which have resulted and could in the future result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks, infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security. Cyber-based risks are evolving and include attacks: (i) on our IT infrastructure (ii) targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of hardware and software; (iii) on information installed, stored or transmitted in our products (including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into third-party products); and (iv) on facilities or similar infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems (or those of third parties) and business operations, impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information in violation of applicable law and/or contractual obligations. We have experienced cyber-based attacks and, due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency or severity. We continue to make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services, operations and confidential data. However, depending on the nature, sophistication and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. As a result, we could potentially experience: (i) production downtimes; (ii) operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations; (iii) destruction or corruption of data (our or third party); (iv) security breaches; (v) manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products; and (vi) financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation&#8212;any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. \n\nIn addition, because of the global nature of our business, our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions, and government enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations. Any disruption to our business arising from such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nWe depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers. Infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. \n\nThe Company's intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes and other confidential information. Although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be valuable, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. We nonetheless rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, customer and supplier agreements, license agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient, however. \n\nWe cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. \n\nIn addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession, ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. Any of these events or factors could subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nWe use a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, and third-party service providers in our business. The ability of suppliers to deliver parts, components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our business performance. Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions, price increases, or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products. \n\nOur reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials (such as copper, aluminum and steel), and on service providers to deliver our products, exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services. We use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products, which come from numerous suppliers around the world. Because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. In addition, certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. We would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these single-source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results. Our supply chain could be impacted by climate change through extreme weather events, resulting in delivery or production disruptions and increased material costs. In addition, other issues with suppliers (such as capacity constraints, quality issues, consolidations, closings or bankruptcies), price increases, raw material shortages, or the decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Additionally, during 2021 and 2022, we have experienced multiple disruptions to our supply chain. This disruption has resulted, and may continue to result, in sufficient inventory not being available in a timely manner or during the appropriate season as well as higher freight and other logistic costs, including increased carrier rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nWe use various tactical and strategic actions to mitigate our raw material and supply chain risks and challenges, including consolidating commodity purchases, locking in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials, proactive engagement with suppliers and our workforce and dynamic management of freight costs and availability. However, these efforts could cause us to pay higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered. Our suppliers could be subject to tariffs as well as climate change related regulations, compliance with which would increase our costs and the impacts of which are difficult to predict. We believe that our supply management and production practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, these risks may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nOur operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including COVID-19-related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns, transportation delays, work stoppages, labor relations, governmental regulatory and enforcement actions, intellectual property claims against suppliers, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, IT failure and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters. For example, we expect to continue to be impacted by the following supply chain issues, due to factors largely beyond our control: a global shortage of semi-conductors, a strain on raw materials and cost inflation, all of which could escalate in the future. Insurance for certain disruptions may not be available, affordable or adequate. The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks. Such disruption has in the past and could in the future interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products. Any significant disruption could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position. \n\nWe design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. \n\nOur future success depends on designing, developing, producing, selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The regulations applicable to our products, as well as our customers&#8217; product and service needs, change from time to time. Moreover, regulatory changes, inclusive of those aimed at addressing climate change and its impacts, may \n\nrender our products and technologies non-compliant and may subject us to operational, compliance and reputational risks. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements or product improvements &#8211; including those associated with regulatory changes &#8211; depends on a variety of factors, including: meeting development, production and regulatory approval schedules; meeting performance plans and expectations; the availability of raw materials and parts; our suppliers&#8217; performance; the hiring, training and deployment of qualified personnel; achieving efficiencies; identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends; validating innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products. \n\nOur products and services also may incorporate technologies developed or manufactured by third parties, which, when combined with our technology or products, creates additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and market acceptance of these third-party products and services could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace. \n\nOur research and development efforts, including those that advance environmental sustainability, may not culminate in new technologies or timely products, or may not meet the needs of our customers as effectively as competitive offerings. Our competitors may develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance before or instead of our products. In addition, we may not be successful in anticipating or reacting to changes in the regulatory environments in which our products are sold, and the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate. \n\nWe operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services . \n\nIn certain of our businesses, our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other factors, the cost to timely provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return, we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule. If we fail to do so, the profitability of contracts may be adversely affected &#8211; including because some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time &#8211; which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nCustomers and others may take disruptive actions. \n\nFrom time to time customers and others may seek to become suppliers of products and services that compete with our own or pursue other strategies to disrupt our business model. For example, an affiliate of a customer in our transport refrigeration business produces refrigeration units for shipping containers that compete with our products, and another one of our transport refrigeration customers produces refrigeration units for truck trailers that compete with our refrigeration units. In addition, our customers or existing or future competitors may seek to introduce non-traditional business models or disruptive technologies and products in the industries in which we participate, resulting in increased competition and new dynamics in these industries. \n\nLabor matters may impact our business. \n\nA significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions or works councils in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. See the section entitled \"Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole - Human Capital Management.\" We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these agreements before they expire. In addition, existing agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our specific business or collective bargaining agreements. Additionally, a shortage in certain work forces, such as technicians, manufacturing workers or truck drivers, due to external forces such as geopolitical strife or pandemics, may impact our business by affecting the ability to produce, install, sell and deliver our products. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) or labor shortages could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, productivity, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. \n\nOur defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results. \n\nThe performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. See Note 10 &#8211; Employee Benefit Plans to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. \n\nWe may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, and our profitability or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. \n\nIn order to operate more efficiently and cost effectively, we have, and we may from time to time, adjust employment levels, optimize our footprint and/or implement other restructuring activities. These activities are complex and may involve or require significant changes to our operations. If we do not successfully manage these activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include: unfavorable political responses and reputational harm; unforeseen delays in the implementation of the restructuring activities; additional costs; adverse effects on employee morale; the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages; and difficulty managing our operations during or after facility consolidations, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, harm our business or reputation, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results. \n\nProduct and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands. If certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards &#8211; which has been the case &#8211; or our customers&#8217; expectations regarding safety or quality, we can and have experienced lost sales and increased costs and we can and have been exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions, which has also occurred in certain instances. In addition, when our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty, product liability, personal injury and other claims. \n\nWe maintain strict quality controls and procedures. However, we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials, which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that products will have defects, which could require a product recall or field corrective action. Product recalls and field corrective actions can be expensive to implement and may damage our reputation, customer relationships and market share. We have conducted product recalls and field corrective actions in the past and may do so again in the future. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery. If any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products, which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claims in the future, that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recall, repair and replacement costs. \n\nWe are subject to litigation, environmental and other legal and compliance risks. \n\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation, legal and compliance risks including, without limitation, claims, lawsuits and/or regulatory enforcement actions relating to breach of contract, cybersecurity and data privacy, employment and labor, environmental and employee health and safety matters, global chemical compliance, intellectual property rights, personal injury, product safety and taxes as well as anti-corruption, competition and securities laws and other laws governing improper business practices. If found responsible in connection with such matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments and other damages (in certain cases, treble damages) and experience reputational harm. \n\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate, structure our investments and enforce our rights. \n\nEmerging global chemical use restrictions related to protection of human health and the environment as well as climate change directives may require additional investments in product designs, resulting in increased manufacturing and production costs as well as updates to product safety assessments. These restrictions may also increase Carrier&#8217;s legal obligations regarding remediation of its current and legacy operational sites. \n\nAt times, we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and property damage. Existing and future asbestos-related claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and putative class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions. Property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used. \n\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Certain of our or our channel partners' customer relationships are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to antitrust, anti-collusion and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Despite meaningful measures to ensure lawful conduct, which include training, audits and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always be able to prevent our employees, third-party agents or channel partners from violating the FCPA or anti-trust, anti-money laundering or other anti-corruption laws. As a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, as well as disgorgement. We could be required to make changes or enhancements to our compliance measures that could increase our costs, and we could be subject to other remedial actions. \n\nViolations of the FCPA, antitrust, anti-money laundering or other anti-corruption or anti-collusion laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nWe also must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the import and export of products, services and technology into and from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include, amongst others, the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Restrictions on the export of our products, services or technologies could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nFor a description of material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see the section entitled \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 23 &#8211; Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nWe are subject to risks arising from doing business with the U.S. government. \n\nAs a supplier and service provider to the U.S. government, including as a subcontractor under prime contracts with the U.S. government, we are subject to certain heightened risks, such as those associated with the government&#8217;s rights to audit and conduct investigations and with its rights to terminate contracts for convenience or default. In light of the current U.S. government contracting environment, we are and will continue to be the subject of U.S. government investigations relating to our U.S. government contracts or subcontracts. Such investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if a business unit were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. government investigation (including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts or subcontracts. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could fine and debar us from receiving new awards for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. \n\nWe engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with, or disposing of businesses from, our current operations; therefore, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures. \n\nWe seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to organic growth. In the past several years, we have acquired consolidated and minority-owned businesses in an effort to complement and expand our business. We expect to continue such pursuits in the future. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target&#8217;s historical activities. For example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities, or reduced sales, as a result of an acquisition&#8217;s violation of applicable laws, such as the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws outside of the U.S. We also may incur &#8211; and have incurred &#8211; unanticipated costs or expenses, including asset impairment and other charges and expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities. We may encounter &#8211; and have encountered &#8211; difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations, establishing internal controls at these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize &#8211; and have sometimes not realized &#8211; the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings subsequent to periods in which we acquire new businesses. \n\nWe also make strategic divestitures from time to time. Our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees, other financial arrangements, continued supply and services arrangements or through the retention of liabilities, such as for environmental and product liability claims. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses or claims against retained liabilities could result in the imposition of obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nThe success of future acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to such transactions and the timing of consummation of such transactions, which will depend in part on the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. \n\nWe may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and intangible assets. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $10.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Our intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, patents, service portfolios and trademarks. We periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, planned or unexpected significant changes in the use of the assets, and sustained market capitalization declines may result in the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment is recognized. \n\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. \n\nCarrier has been issued an investment grade credit rating by each of Moody&#8217;s Investors Services, Inc. (\"Moody's\"), Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (\"S&#38;P\") and Fitch Ratings Inc. (\"Fitch Ratings\"). Nonetheless, any future downgrades could increase our borrowing costs, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to the capital markets. Additionally, our credit agreements generally provide for an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded. \n\nWe incurred debt obligations, and we may incur additional debt obligations in the future, which could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $8.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness. See Note 7 &#8211; Borrowings and Lines of Credit in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section entitled \"Liquidity and Financial Condition\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. \n\nOur debt obligations could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors, including: (1) requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments; (2) making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations; (3) increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; (4) increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (5) reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; (6) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; (7) placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged; and (8) limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase shares. \n\nAs described in Note 7 &#8211; Borrowings and Lines of Credit in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Liquidity and Financial Condition\" the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants restricting our financial flexibility in a number of ways, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur liens, to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Japanese Term Loan Facility (both defined subsequently) require that we not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio . If we breach a restrictive covenant under any of our indebtedness, or an event of default occurs in respect of any of our indebtedness, our lenders may be entitled to declare all amounts owing in respect thereof to be immediately due and payable. \n\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the foregoing risks could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. \n\nRisks Related to the Separation from UTC \n\nAfter the Separation and the Distribution, certain members of management, directors and shareowners own stock in UTC, Carrier and Otis, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest. \n\nFollowing the Separation and the Distribution, certain members of management and the Board of Directors of each of UTC, Carrier and Otis own common stock in all three companies. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other two companies. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and Carrier&#8217;s relationship with UTC and Otis thereafter. These agreements include a separation and distribution agreement, the TMA, the employee matters agreement, the intellectual property agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or UTC may enter into in the future. See Note 1 &#8211; Description of the Business in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these agreements. \n\nIn connection with the Separation into three independent public companies, each of UTC, Carrier and Otis has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay UTC and/or Otis under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Also, the UTC or Otis indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which UTC and Otis have been allocated responsibility, and UTC and/or Otis may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future. \n\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements among UTC, Carrier and Otis, each party has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities as discussed further in Note 1 &#8211; Description of the Business in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Indemnities that we may be required to provide UTC and/or Otis are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that UTC and/or Otis has agreed to retain. The indemnities from UTC and Otis for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and UTC and/or Otis may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to such indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. \n\nMoreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from UTC or Otis, as applicable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \n\nIn certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify UTC for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the TMA. \n\nUnder the TMA, Carrier is generally required to indemnify UTC and Otis for any taxes resulting from the Separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from: (1) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Carrier, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (2) other actions or failures to act by Carrier or (3) certain of Carrier&#8217;s representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS ruling and/or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Further, under the TMA, we are generally required to indemnify UTC and Otis for a specified portion of any taxes (and any related costs and other damages) (a) arising as a result of the failure of the Distribution and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free (including if the transactions were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code) or a failure of any internal separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis or UTC or (b) arising from an adjustment, pursuant to an audit or other tax proceeding, with respect to any separation transaction that is not intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. See Note 1 &#8211; Description of the Business in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nPotential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nIn connection with the Separation (including the internal reorganization described previously), UTC completed several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which, along with the Distribution, may be subject to various fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws. If, under these laws, a court were to determine that, at the time of the Separation, any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the Separation: (1) was insolvent, was rendered insolvent by reason of the Separation, or had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital, and (2) received less than fair consideration in exchange for the Distribution; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured, then the court could void the Separation and the Distribution, in whole or in part, as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. The court could then require our shareowners to return to UTC some or all of the shares of Carrier common stock issued in the Distribution, or require UTC or Carrier, as the case may be, to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors. The measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Carrier or any of our subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Distribution. \n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock \n\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. \n\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate. \n\nThe factors that could affect our common stock price include among others: (1) industry or general market conditions, including inflation and increasing cost of goods; (2) domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; (3) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities; (5) changes in our customers&#8217; preferences; (6) new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; (7) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; (8) changes in securities analysts&#8217; estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts; (9) action by institutional shareowners or other large shareowners; (10) failure to meet any financial guidance given by us or any change in any financial guidance given by us, or changes by us in our financial guidance practices; (11) announcements by us of significant impairment charges; (12) speculation in the press or investment community; (13) investor perception of us and our industry; (14) changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; (15) announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, \n\ndispositions or strategic partnerships; (16) war or terrorist acts; (17) any future sales of our common stock or other securities; (18) additions or departures of key personnel and (19) failure to achieve any of our environmental, social or governance goals. \n\nThe stock markets have experienced volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. \n\nShareowner's percentage of ownership in Carrier's common stock may be diluted in the future. \n\nThe percentage ownership of shareowners in Carrier's common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have, and will receive from Carrier, stock-based awards that correspond to shares of our common stock. Such awards have had and will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Note 14 &#8211; Stock-Based Compensation and Note 18 &#8211; Earnings Per Share in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nQuarterly cash dividends may be discontinued or modified, are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock. \n\nQuarterly cash dividends are a component of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with operating cash flows, borrowings and divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends. Dividends may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends may vary from past practice or from our stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. \n\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareowners, which could discourage lawsuits against Carrier and our directors and officers. \n\nCarrier&#8217;s amended and restated bylaws provide that unless Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors otherwise determines, the state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Carrier, any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of Carrier to Carrier or to Carrier shareowners, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against Carrier or any current or former director or officer or other employee of Carrier arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#8220;DGCL&#8221;) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, any action asserting a claim relating to or involving Carrier governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or any action asserting an &#8220;internal corporate claim&#8221; as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. \n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), although Carrier shareowners will not be deemed to have waived Carrier&#8217;s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies&#8217; organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable. \n\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareowners to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareowners find favorable for disputes with Carrier or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against \n\nCarrier and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described previously, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nAnti-takeover provisions could enable our Board of Directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners. \n\nCarrier&#8217;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: (1) the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors (except in an instance where a director is removed by shareowners and the resulting vacancy is filled by shareowners); (2) limitations on shareowners&#8217; ability to call a special shareowner meeting; (3) rules regarding how shareowners may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareowner meetings; and (4) the right of Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareowner approval. \n\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that shareowners may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation&#8217;s outstanding voting stock. \n\nWe believe these provisions will protect our shareowners from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors and by providing Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make Carrier immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareowners and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Carrier&#8217;s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Carrier and our shareowners. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nNatural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance. \n\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events, including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19) or other contagious outbreaks, conflicts, wars or terrorist acts, in the U.S. or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or long-term, such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting the availability and/or cost of materials needed for manufacturing. In some cases, we have one factory that can manufacture a specific product or product line. As a result, damage to or the closure of a certain factory or factories may disrupt or prevent us from manufacturing certain products. Existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events. The occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales. \n\nWe may be affected by global economic, capital market and political conditions, and conditions in the construction, transportation and infrastructure industries in particular. \n\nOur business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks and conditions, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, fluctuations in residential, commercial and industrial construction activity, pandemic health issues (including COVID-19 and its effects), natural disasters, commodity prices, energy costs, interest rate fluctuations, inflation, recession, foreign exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies (including tariffs, boycotts and sanctions), military conflicts, acts of terrorism, regulatory changes, actual or anticipated defaults on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. \n\nThese economic and political conditions affect our business in a number of ways. In March 2022, we suspended business operations in Russia by ceasing to pursue new business opportunities while continuing to fulfill existing contracts for equipment, service and parts, where possible, in a manner that fully complies with applicable sanctions and trade controls. Our sales, operations and supply chain in Russia and Ukraine are not material to Carrier. However, the military conflict between the two countries and attendant geopolitical environment may continue to negatively impact the global economy and major financial markets, and may result in additional increases in commodity prices and supply-chain disruptions, including shortages of materials, higher costs for fuel and freight and increased transportation delays. In addition, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact the global economy remains uncertain. This military conflict, COVID-19, the potential for an increase of their impact on global or regional economies and the perception that such events may occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, the tightening of credit in the capital markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers, including individual end-customers and businesses, to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Similarly, tightening credit may adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Additionally, because we have a number of factories and suppliers in foreign countries, the imposition of tariffs or additional sanctions or unusually restrictive border crossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain, operations and overall business. \n\nOur business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending and construction (both residential and commercial as well as remodeling). In addition, our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment, including truck production cycles in North America and Europe. \n\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. \n\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives, execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership. \n\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions. Changes to tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations or other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions could also launch new examinations and expand existing examinations. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue, and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. \n\nSee \"Business Overview\" and \"Results of Operations&#8212;Income Taxes\" under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 3 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 &#8211; Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies. \n\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us. \n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, among other things, we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may change over time due to changes in our business or in applicable accounting rules. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness \n\nwill not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal controls over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. \n\nMatters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in our company and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could have a material and adverse effect on us by, for example, leading to a decline in the share price of our common stock and impairing our ability to raise additional capital. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\nAsbestos Matters \n\nThe Company has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos allegedly integrated into certain Carrier products or business premises. While the Company has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it into any currently-manufactured products, certain products that the Company no longer manufactures contained components incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been dismissed without payment or have been covered in full or in part by insurance or other forms of indemnity. Additional cases were litigated and settled without any insurance reimbursement. The amounts involved in asbestos-related claims were not material individually or in the aggregate in any period. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities are based on currently available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable and are made with input from outside actuarial experts. These amounts are undiscounted and exclude the Company&#8217;s legal fees to defend the asbestos claims, which are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company has recorded insurance recovery receivables for probable asbestos-related recoveries. \n\nUTC Equity Awards Conversion Litigation \n\nOn August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint (the \"Complaint\") in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Raytheon Technologies Corporation, Carrier, Otis, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors ( Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al .). The Complaint challenged the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to UTC, Carrier and Otis equity awards following the Separation and the Distribution. Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. Plaintiffs amended their Complaint on September 13, 2021 (the \"Amended Complaint\"). The Amended Complaint, with Raytheon, Carrier and Otis as the only defendants, asserted that the defendants are \n\nliable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Amended Complaint also sought specific performance. Carrier believes all plaintiffs' claims against the Company are without merit. Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On September 30, 2022, the court dismissed the case against all defendants, with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The briefing process is ongoing. \n\nAqueous Film Forming Foam Litigation \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Kidde-Fenwal, Inc. (\"KFI\"), have been named as defendants in more than 3,150 lawsuits filed by individuals in or removed to the federal courts of the United States alleging that the historic use of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (\"AFFF\") caused personal injuries and/or property damage. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries including KFI, have also been named as a defendant in more than 300 lawsuits filed by several U.S. states, municipalities and water utilities in or removed to U.S. federal courts alleging that the historic use of AFFF caused contamination of property and water supplies. In December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred and consolidated all AFFF cases pending in the U.S. federal courts against the Company and others to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina (\"MDL Court\") for pre-trial proceedings (\"MDL Proceedings\"). The individual plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings generally seek damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, diminution in property value and injunctive relief to remediate alleged contamination of water supplies. The U.S. state, municipal and water utility plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings generally seek damages and costs related to the remediation of public property and water supplies. \n\nAFFF is a firefighting foam, developed beginning in the late 1960s pursuant to U.S. military specification, used to extinguish certain types of hydrocarbon-fueled fires primarily at military bases and airports. AFFF was manufactured by several companies, including National Foam and Angus Fire. UTC subsidiaries first entered the AFFF business with their acquisition of National Foam and Angus Fire in 2005 as part of the acquisition of KFI and Kidde Products Limited (\"KPL\"). In 2013, KFI and KPL divested the National Foam and Angus Fire businesses to a third party. The Company acquired KFI and KPL as part of its separation from UTC in April 2020. During the eight-year period of its operation by KFI, National Foam manufactured AFFF for sale to government (including the U.S. federal government) and non-government customers in the U.S. at a single facility located in West Chester, Pennsylvania (\"Pennsylvania Site\"). During the same period, Angus Fire manufactured AFFF for sale outside the United States at a single facility located in Bentham, England. \n\nThe key components of AFFF that contribute to its fire-extinguishing capabilities are known as fluorosurfactants. Neither the Company nor any of its former or current subsidiaries, including National Foam/Angus Fire and KFI/KPL, respecitively, manufactured fluorosurfactants; they instead purchased these substances from unrelated third parties to in turn manufacture AFFF. Plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings allege that the fluorosurfactants used by various manufacturers in producing AFFF contained, or over time degraded into, compounds known as perflourooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\") and/or perflourooctane acid (\"PFOA\"). Plaintiffs further allege that, as a result of the use of AFFF, PFOS and PFOA were released into the environment and, in some instances, ultimately reached drinking water supplies. \n\nPlaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings allege that PFOS and PFOA contamination has resulted from the use of AFFF manufactured using a process known as ECF, and that this process was used exclusively by 3M. They also allege that PFOA contamination has resulted from the use of AFFF manufactured using a different process, known as telomerization and that this process was used exclusively by the other AFFF manufacturers (including National Foam and Angus Fire). Compounds containing PFOS and PFOA (as well as many other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known collectively as \"PFAS\") have also been used for decades by many third parties in a number of different industries to manufacture firefighters' protective outerwear, carpets, clothing, fabrics, cookware, food packaging, personal care products, cleaning products, paints, varnishes and other consumer and industrial products. \n\nPlaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings have named multiple defendants, including four suppliers of chemicals and raw materials used to manufacture fluorosurfactants, four fluorosurfactant manufacturers, two toll manufacturers of fluorosurfactants and seven current (including National Foam and Angus Fire) and former (including the Company and KFI) AFFF manufacturers. \n\nThe defendants moved for summary judgment on the government contractor defense, which potentially applies to AFFF sold to or used by the U.S. government. After full briefing and oral argument, on September 16, 2022, the MDL court declined to enter summary judgment for the defendants. The defense, however, remains available at any trial to which it applies. \n\nOn September 23, 2022, after completion of discovery, the MDL court selected one water provider case, the City of Stuart, FL v. 3M, et al. , for a bellwether trial. That trial is tentatively scheduled for June 2023. The MDL court has ordered that the \n\nbellwether process for personal injury cases will begin in 2023. The court has not yet outlined details on that process or its timing. \n\nOutside of the MDL Proceedings, the Company and other defendants are also party to six lawsuits in U.S. state courts brought by oil refining companies alleging product liability claims related to legacy sales of AFFF and seeking damages for the costs to replace the product and for property damage. In addition, the Company and other defendants are party to two actions related to the Pennsylvania Site in which the plaintiff water utility company seeks remediation costs related to the alleged contamination of the local water supply. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, and other defendants are also party to one action in Arizona state court brought by a firefighter claiming that occupational exposure to AFFF has caused him certain personal injuries. The Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims in the MDL Proceedings and the other AFFF lawsuits. Based on its 2013 agreement for the sale of National Foam and Angus Fire, the Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI are pursuing indemnification against these claims from the purchaser and current owner of National Foam and Angus Fire. The Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, are also pursuing insurance coverage for these claims. At this time, however, given the numerous factual, scientific and legal issues to be resolved relating to these claims, the Company is unable to assess the probability of liability or to reasonably estimate the damages, if any, to be allocated to the Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, if one or more plaintiffs were to prevail in these cases. There can be no assurance that any such future exposure will not be material in any period. \n\nOther \n\nWe have commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the ordinary course of business. Additionally, we are routinely a defendant in, party to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some of these proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against us and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nA further discussion of our potential regulatory liabilities can be found under the headings \"Business\" and \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n"

      "text": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW \n\nBusiness Summary \n\nCarrier Global Corporation is the leading global provider of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions with a focus on providing differentiated, digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions to our customers. Our portfolio includes industry-leading brands such as Carrier, Toshiba, Automated Logic, Carrier Transicold, Kidde, Edwards and LenelS2 that offer innovative HVAC, refrigeration, fire, security and building automation technologies to help make the world safer and more comfortable. We also provide a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance and monitoring. Our operations are classified into three segments: HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire &#38; Security. \n\nOur worldwide operations are affected by global and regional industrial, economic and political factors and trends. These include the mega-trends of urbanization, climate change and increasing requirements for food safety driven by the food needs of our growing global population and the rising standards of living in emerging markets. We believe that our business segments are well positioned to benefit from favorable secular trends, including these mega-trends and from the strength of our industry-leading brands and track record of innovation. In addition, we regularly review our end markets to proactively identify trends and adapt our strategies accordingly. \n\nOur business is also affected by changes in the general level of economic activity, such as changes in business and consumer spending, construction and shipping activity as well as short-term economic factors such as currency fluctuations, commodity price volatility and supply disruptions. We continue to invest in our business, take pricing actions to mitigate supply chain and inflationary pressures, develop new products and services in order to remain competitive in our markets and use risk management strategies to mitigate various exposures. We believe that we have industry-leading global brands, which form the foundation of our business strategy. Coupled with our focus on growth, innovation and operational efficiency, we expect to drive long-term future growth and increased value for our shareowners. \n\nSignificant Events \n\nAcquisition of Toshiba Carrier Corporation \n\nOn February 6, 2022, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire a majority ownership interest in TCC, a VRF and light commercial HVAC joint venture between Carrier and Toshiba Corporation. TCC designs and manufactures flexible, energy-efficient and high-performance VRF and light commercial HVAC systems as well as commercial products, compressors and heat pumps. The acquisition included all of TCC's advanced research and development centers and global manufacturing operations, product pipeline and the long-term use of Toshiba's iconic brand. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2022. As a result, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of TCC are consolidated in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as of the date of acquisition and reported within our HVAC segment. Upon closing, Toshiba Corporation retained a 5% ownership interest in TCC. \n\nSupply Chain Challenges \n\nThe ongoing global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures, component shortages and transportation delays. As a result, we have incurred incremental costs for commodities and components used in our products as well as component shortages that have negatively \n\nimpacted our sales and results of operations. We expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future. \n\nWe continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in our supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components and localized manufacturing when feasible. To date, there has been limited disruption to the availability of our products, though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if these supply chain challenges continue. \n\nRussia's Invasion of Ukraine \n\nIn February 2022, Russian forces initiated a military action against Ukraine. As a result, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries have imposed sanctions that have increased global economic and political uncertainty. We operated in Russia through a Russia-based subsidiary and a joint venture which represented less than 1% of our total assets and revenue. On March 10, 2022, we announced that we were suspending business operations in Russia, honoring existing contractual obligations in a manner that fully complies with all sanctions and trade controls imposed. As of December 31, 2022, we have ceased all operations in Russia. While neither Russia nor Ukraine constitute a material portion of our business, the conflict could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact our results of operations. We continue to monitor the evolving impacts of this conflict and its effect on the global economy and geopolitical landscape. \n\nSale of Chubb Fire &#38; Security Business \n\nOn July 26, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell our Chubb business to APi. Chubb, which was reported within our Fire &#38; Security segment, delivered essential fire safety and security solutions from design and installation to monitoring, service and maintenance across more than 17 countries around the globe. On January 3, 2022, we completed the Chubb Sale for net proceeds of $2.9 billion and recognized a gain on the sale of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic \n\nIn early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory disease known as COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In response, many countries implemented containment and mitigation measures to combat the outbreak, which severely restricted the level of economic activity and caused a significant contraction in the global economy. As a result, we took several preemptive actions to manage liquidity, preserve the health and safety of our employees and customers as well as maintaining the continuity of our operations. The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period, which can have a significant effect on reported amounts. However, due to significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, including a resurgence in cases and the spread of COVID-19 variants, management's judgments could change. While our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted, the extent of any continuing impact cannot be estimated with certainty at this time. \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with December 31, 2021 . This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A detailed discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020 is not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the Company's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2022, under the heading \"Results of Operations,\" which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021 \n\nAs a result of the Chubb Sale, we do not have any remaining ownership interest in Chubb and no longer consolidate Chubb in our financial statements as of January 3, 2022. Therefore, this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations only includes the financial results of Chubb in periods prior to the date of sale. As a result, prior period results may not be comparable to the current period. \n\nThe results of TCC's operations are included in our consolidated results since the acquisition date of August 1, 2022. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our minority ownership in TCC under the equity method of accounting and recognized our portion of earnings within Equity method investment in net earnings as part of operating expenses. As a result, prior period results may not be comparable to the current period. \n\nThe following represents our consolidated net sales and operating results: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Period Change % Change Net sales $ 20,421 $ 20,613 $ (192) (1) % Cost of products and services sold (14,957) (14,633) (324) 2 % Gross margin 5,464 5,980 (516) (9) % Operating expenses (949) (3,335) 2,386 (72) % Operating profit 4,515 2,645 1,870 71 % Non-operating income (expense), net (223) (245) 22 (9) % Income from operations before income taxes 4,292 2,400 1,892 79 % Income tax expense (708) (699) (9) 1 % Net income from operations 3,584 1,701 1,883 111 % Less: Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries' earnings from operations 50 37 13 35 % Net income attributable to common shareowners $ 3,534 &#160; $ 1,664 &#160; $ 1,870 &#160; 112 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nNet Sales \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Net sales was $20.4 billion, a 1% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 Organic / Operational 8 % Foreign currency translation (3) % Acquisitions and divestitures, net (6) % Total % change (1) % ##TABLE_END\n\nOrganic sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 8% compared with the same period of 2021. We continue to benefit from the demand for energy-efficient, digital products and healthy building solutions. In addition, pricing improvements more than offset inflationary impacts in each of our segments. The organic increase was primarily driven by our HVAC segment due to pricing improvements in our North America residential and light commercial business and improved global end-markets in our Commercial HVAC business. Refrigeration results were flat as each of the segment's businesses experienced challenges in certain end markets during the second half of the year. Pricing improvements in our Fire &#38; Security segment were the primary driver of growth compared with the prior year while supply chain and logistics constraints continue to be challenging. Refer to \"Segment Review\" below for a discussion of Net sales by segment. \n\nGross Margin \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, gross margin was $5.5 billion, a 9% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. The components were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 20,421 $ 20,613 Cost of products and services sold (14,957) (14,633) Gross margin $ 5,464 &#160; $ 5,980 Percentage of net sales 26.8 % 29.0 % ##TABLE_END\n\nGross margin decreased by $516 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. A main driver of the decrease related to incremental costs of products and services sold associated with TCC since the date of acquisition, which included inventory step-up, backlog amortization and intangible asset amortization resulting from the recognition of acquired assets at fair value. These costs had a 50 basis point impact on gross margin as a percentage of Net sales . In addition, each of our segments continue to be impacted by the higher cost of commodities and components used in our products, certain supply chain constraints and higher freight costs. However, these impacts were partially offset by ongoing customer demand, pricing improvements and our continued focus on productivity initiatives. Although pricing improvements more than offset inflationary impacts and supply chain challenges, gross margin as a percentage of Net sales decreased by 220 basis points compared with the same period of 2021. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, operating expenses, including Equity method investment net earnings , was $0.9 billion, a 72% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. The components were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Selling, general and administrative $ (2,512) $ (3,120) Research and development (539) (503) Equity method investment net earnings 262 249 Other income (expense), net 1,840 39 Operating expenses $ (949) $ (3,335) Percentage of net sales 4.6 % 16.2 % ##TABLE_END\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.5 billion, a 19% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. The decrease is primarily due to the Chubb Sale on January 3, 2022. In addition, lower restructuring charges and the benefit provided by changes in the fair value of cash-settled equity awards further contributed to the decrease. These amounts were partially offset by incremental selling, general and administrative expenses associated with TCC since the date of acquisition and $31 million of acquisition-related costs. The year ended December 31, 2021 included $43 million of costs related to the Chubb Sale and $20 million of costs related to the Separation. \n\nResearch and development costs relate to new product development and new technology innovation. Due to the variable nature of program development schedules, year-over-year spending levels can fluctuate. In addition, we continue to invest to prepare for future energy efficiency and refrigerant regulation changes and in digital controls technologies. \n\nInvestments over which we do not exercise control, but have significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Equity method investment net earnings were $262 million, a 5% increase compared with the same period of 2021. The increase was primarily related to a $27 million gain on the sale of two minority owned subsidiaries by one of our joint ventures. In addition, higher earnings in HVAC joint ventures in Asia and North America further benefited earnings. These amounts were partially offset by the increase in our ownership interest in TCC on August 1, 2022. As a result, TCC is no longer accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the date of acquisition. \n\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the impact of gains and losses related to the sale of interests in our equity method investments, foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency and hedging-related activities. In connection with the TCC acquisition, the carrying value of our previously held TCC equity investments were recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. As a result, we recognized a $705 million non-cash gain associated with the increase in our ownership interest. In addition, we completed the Chubb Sale and recognized a net gain on the sale of $1.1 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. \n\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), net \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 , Non-operating income (expense), net was $223 million, a 9% decrease co mpared with the same period of 2021. The components were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Non-service pension benefit (expense) $ (4) $ 61 Interest expense (302) (319) Interest income 83 13 Interest (expense) income, net (219) (306) Non-operating income (expense), net $ (223) $ (245) ##TABLE_END\n\nNon-operating income (expense), net includes the results from activities other than normal business operations such as interest expense, interest income and the non-service components of pension and post-retirement obligations. Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt. For the year ended December 31, 2022, interest expense was $302 million, a 5% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed tender offers to repurchase approximately $1.15 billion aggregate principal of our 2.242% Notes due 2025 and 2.493% Notes due 2027. Upon settlement, we wrote off $5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in Interest expense and recognized a net gain of $33 million in Interest income . During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred a make-whole premium of $17 million and write-off of $2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the redemption of our $500 million 1.923% Notes originally due in February 2023. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; 2022 2021 Effective tax rate 16.5 % 29.1 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was lower than our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate. The decrease was driven by a lower effective tax rate on the $705 million non-cash gain resulting from the recognition of our previously held TCC equity investments at fair value upon acquisition of TCC, a lower effective tax rate on the $1.1 billion Chubb gain and $45 million of foreign tax credits generated and utilized in the current year. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was higher than our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate. The increase was driven by a net tax charge of $157 million primarily relating to the re-organization and disentanglement of certain Chubb subsidiaries executed in advance of the planned divestiture of Chubb and a $43 million deferred tax charge as a result of the tax rate increase from 19% to 25% in the United Kingdom. These amounts were partially offset by a favorable tax adjustment of $70 million due to foreign tax credits generated and expected to be utilized in the current year and $21 million resulting from the re-organization of a German subsidiary. \n\nSegment Review \n\nWe conduct our operations through three reportable segments: \n\n&#8226; The HVAC segment provides products, controls, services and solutions to meet the heating, cooling and ventilation needs of residential and commercial customers while enhancing building performance, health, energy efficiency and sustainability. \n\n&#8226; The Refrigeration segment includes transport refrigeration and monitoring products, services and digital solutions for trucks, trailers, shipping containers, intermodal and rail, as well as commercial refrigeration products. \n\n&#8226; The Fire &#38; Security segment provides a wide range of residential, commercial and industrial technologies designed to help protect people and property. \n\nWe determine our segments based on how our Chief Executive Officer, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the \"CODM\"), allocates resources, assesses performance and makes operational decisions. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the financial performance of each of our segments based on Net sales and Operating profit . Adjustments to reconcile segment reporting to the consolidated results are included in Note 21 - Segment Financial Data. \n\nSummary performance for each of our segments is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Net Sales Operating Profit Operating Margin (In millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 HVAC $ 13,408 $ 11,390 $ 2,610 $ 1,738 19.5 % 15.3 % Refrigeration 3,883 4,127 483 476 12.4 % 11.5 % Fire &#38; Security 3,570 5,515 1,630 662 45.7 % 12.0 % Total segment $ 20,861 &#160; $ 21,032 &#160; $ 4,723 &#160; $ 2,876 &#160; 22.6 &#160; % 13.7 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nHVAC Segment \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Net sales in our HVAC segment was $13.4 billion, an 18% increase compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Net sales Organic / Operational 12 % Foreign currency translation (2) % Acquisitions and divestitures, net 8 % Total % change 18 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe organic increase in Net sales of 12% was driven by continued strong results across each of the segment's businesses. Increased sales in our North America residential and light commercial business (up 14%) were primarily driven by pricing improvements and end market demand. These amounts were partially offset by volume reductions in certain end markets. Increased sales in our Commercial HVAC business (up 9%) benefited from pricing improvements and ongoing customer demand in our end-markets. The business saw growth in North America and Asia while growth in Europe was tempered by current economic conditions and inflationary cost pressures which impacted end-market demand. Increased sales in our Global Comfort Solutions business (up 8%) were primarily driven by pricing improvements. While current demand remains strong, supply chain and logistics constraints continue to be challenging, negatively impacting our sales and results of operations. In addition, results for 2021 reflected a significant rebound in demand after initial weakness associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nOn August 1, 2022, the Commercial HVAC business acquired a majority ownership interest in TCC, a VRF and light commercial HVAC joint venture between Carrier and Toshiba Corporation. The results of TCC have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. The transaction added 7% to Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in Acquisitions and divestitures, net. \n\nOn June 1, 2021, the Commercial HVAC business acquired a 70% controlling interest in Guangdong Giwee Group and its subsidiaries (\"Giwee\") and subsequently acquired the remaining 30% ownership interest on September 7, 2021. Giwee is a China-based manufacturer offering a portfolio of HVAC products including variable refrigerant flow, modular chillers and light commercial air conditioners. The results of Giwee have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. The transaction added 1% to Net sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in Acquisitions and divestitures, net. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Operating profit in our HVAC segment was $2.6 billion, a 50% increase compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating profit Organic / Operational 10 % Foreign currency translation (1) % Acquisitions and divestitures, net (1) % Restructuring 1 % Other 41 % Total % change 50 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe operational profit increase of 10% was primarily attributable to pricing improvements compared with the prior year. Higher earnings from equity method investments in Asia and North America also benefited operational profit and included a $27 million gain on the sale of two minority owned subsidiaries by one of our joint ventures. These amounts were partially offset by the increase in our ownership interest in TCC on August 1, 2022. As a result, TCC is no longer accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the date of acquisition. In addition, productivity initiatives provided further benefits to operational profit. These amounts were partially offset by the higher costs of commodities and components used in our products as well as higher freight and logistics costs. \n\nIn connection with the TCC acquisition, the carrying value of our previously held TCC equity investments were recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. As a result, we recognized a $705 million non-cash gain associated with the increase in our ownership interest in Other. In addition, amounts reported in Other include a $22 million charge resulting from a litigation matter recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nRefrigeration Segment \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Net sales in our Refrigeration segment was $3.9 billion, a 6% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Net sales Organic / Operational &#8212; % Foreign currency translation (6) % Total % change (6) % ##TABLE_END\n\nOrganic Net sales were flat compared to the prior year as each of the segment's businesses experienced challenges in certain end markets during the second half of the year. Results for Commercial refrigeration were flat compared with the prior year, primarily driven by continued supply chain constraints and lower volumes in Europe as economic conditions and inflationary cost pressures impacted end-market demand. In addition, ongoing growth in Asia was more than offset by fourth quarter COVID-19 impacts. These impacts were offset by pricing improvements. Transport refrigeration sales were flat compared to the prior year as pricing improvements and strong end market demand in the U.S. and Europe were offset by continued weakness in the marine sector. The year ended December 31, 2021 reflected a significant rebound in demand associated with the cyclical decline that began in late 2019 as well as the demand for global transportation and COVID-19 vaccine-related cargo monitoring. In addition, supply chain and logistics constraints continue to be challenging, negatively impacting our sales and results of operations. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Operating profit in our Refrigeration segment was $483 million, a 2% increase compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating profit Organic / Operational 5 % Foreign currency translation (7) % Restructuring 3 % Other 1 % Total % change 2 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe increase in operational profit of 5% was primarily attributable to pricing improvements compared with the prior year. In addition, favorable productivity initiatives and lower selling, general and administrative costs further benefited operational profit. These amounts were partially offset by the higher costs of commodities and components used in our products and higher freight and logistic costs. \n\nFire &#38; Security Segment \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Net sales in our Fire &#38; Security segment was $3.6 billion, a 35% decrease compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Net sales Organic / Operational 5 % Foreign currency translation (2) % Acquisitions and divestitures, net (38) % Total % change (35) % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe organic increase in Net sales of 5% was primarily driven by pricing improvements compared with the prior year. The segment primarily saw growth in both residential and commercial sales in the Americas and Europe as sales in China decreased as a result of current economic conditions and reduced end-market demand. Global industrial sales also benefited segment results with pricing improvements and strong demand. Results for 2021 reflected a significant rebound in demand after initial weakness associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, supply chain constraints continue to be challenging, negatively impacting our sales and results of operations. \n\nAcquisitions and divestitures, net primarily relates to the prior year results of our Chubb business, the sale of which was completed on January 3, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Net sales in our Fire &#38; Security segment were $5.5 billion, which included $2.2 billion from our Chubb business. Absent the results of Chubb, Net sales increased 6% from $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, Operating profit in our Fire &#38; Security segment was $1.6 billion, a 146% increase compared with the same period of 2021. The components of the year-over-year change were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Operating profit Organic / Operational (5) % Foreign currency translation (2) % Acquisitions and divestitures, net (15) % Restructuring 2 % Other 166 % Total % change 146 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe operational profit decrease of 5% was primarily attributable to the higher costs of commodities and components used in our products and higher freight and logistics costs. In addition, unfavorable mix and lower volumes further impacted results \n\ncompared with the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by pricing improvements and favorable productivity initiatives. \n\nAcquisitions and divestitures, net primarily relates to the prior year results of our Chubb business, the sale of which was completed on January 3, 2022. Amounts reported during the year ended December 31, 2021 include $42 million of transaction costs associated with the divestiture. Amounts reported in Other represent the net gain on the Chubb Sale of $1.1 billion. \n\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION \n\nWe assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash necessary to fund our current and future cash requirements to support our business and strategic initiatives. In doing so, we review and analyze our cash on hand, working capital, debt service requirements and capital expenditures. We rely on operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity. In addition, we have access to other sources of capital to finance our strategic initiatives and fund growth. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion, of which approximately 42% was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds and the cost effectiveness with which we can access funds held by foreign subsidiaries. On occasion, we are required to maintain cash deposits in connection with contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of such restricted cash was $7 million and $39 million, respectively. \n\nWe maintain a $2.0 billion unsecured, unsubordinated commercial paper program which we can use for general corporate purposes, including working capital and potential acquisitions. In addition, we maintain our $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with various banks (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") that matures on April 3, 2025 which supports our commercial paper borrowing program and cash requirements. The Revolving Credit Facility has a commitment fee of 0.125% that is charged on the unused commitments. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available in U.S. Dollars, Euros and Pounds Sterling and bear interest at a variable interest rate plus a ratings-based margin, which was 125 basis points as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and our Revolving Credit Facility. \n\nWe believe that our available cash and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our committed credit facilities and access to the debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term capital to fund current operations, debt maturities and future investment opportunities. Although we believe that the arrangements currently in place permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (1) our credit ratings or absence of credit ratings; (2) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (3) the state of the economy, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. \n\nThe following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity: \n\n##TABLE_START As of December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,520 $ 2,987 Total debt $ 8,842 $ 9,696 Net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) $ 5,322 $ 6,709 Total equity $ 8,076 $ 7,094 Total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) $ 16,918 $ 16,790 Net capitalization (total debt plus total equity less cash and cash equivalents) $ 13,398 $ 13,803 Total debt to total capitalization 52 % 58 % Net debt to net capitalization 40 % 49 % ##TABLE_END\n\nBorrowings and Lines of Credit \n\nOur short-term obligations primarily consist of current maturities of long-term debt. Our long-term obligations primarily consist of long-term notes with maturity dates ranging between 2025 and 2050. Interest payments related to long-term notes are \n\nexpected to approximate $249 million per year, reflecting an approximate weighted-average interest rate of 2.85%. Any borrowings from the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to variable interest rates. See Note 7 - Borrowings and Lines of Credit in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the terms of our long-term debt obligations. \n\nScheduled maturities of long-term debt, excluding amortization of discount, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2023 $ 140 2024 $ 2 2025 $ 1,202 2026 $ 2 2027 $ 1,306 Thereafter $ 6,251 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nOn March 15, 2022, we commenced tender offers to repurchase up to $1.15 billion aggregate principal of our 2.242% Notes due 2025 and 2.493% Notes due 2027. The tender offers included payment of applicable accrued and unpaid interest up to the settlement date, along with a fixed spread for early repayment. Based on participation, we elected to settle the tender offers on March 30, 2022. The aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes validly tendered and accepted was approximately $1.15 billion and included $800 million of Notes due 2025 and $350 million of Notes due 2027. Upon settlement, we recognized a net gain of $33 million and wrote off $5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs during the three months ended March 31, 2022. \n\nOn July 15, 2022, we entered into a five-year, JPY 54 billion (approximately $400 million) senior unsecured term loan facility with MUFG Bank Ltd., as administrative agent and lender, and certain other lenders (the \"Japanese Term Loan Facility\"). Borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to the Tokyo Term Risk Free Rate plus 0.75%. In addition, it is subject to customary covenants including a covenant to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. On July 25, 2022, we borrowed JPY 54 billion under the Japanese Term Loan Facility and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the TCC acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. \n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility, the Japanese Term Loan Facility and the indentures for our long-term notes contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, which among other things, limit our ability to incur additional liens, to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of December 31, 2022, we were compliant with the covenants under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness. \n\nThe following table presents our credit ratings and outlook as of December 31, 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START Rating Agency Long-term Rating (1) \n\nShort-term Rating Outlook (2) \n\nS&#38;P \n\nBBB A2 Positive \n\nMoody's \n\nBaa3 P3 Stable Fitch Ratings BBB- F3 Stable ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The long-term rating for S&#38;P was affirmed on May 14, 2021, and for Moody's on March 30, 2022. Fitch Ratings' long-term rating was issued on June 3, 2021. \n\n(2) S&#38;P revised its outlook to positive from stable on May 20, 2022. \n\nAcquisitions and Divestitures \n\nOn January 3, 2022, we completed the Chubb Sale for net proceeds of $2.9 billion. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, the net proceeds will be used to fund investments in organic and inorganic growth initiatives and capital returns to shareowners as well as for general corporate purposes. \n\nOn February 6, 2022, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire a majority ownership interest in TCC for $930 million, less cash acquired. The transaction was completed on August 1, 2022 and funded through the Japanese Term Loan Facility and cash on hand. Upon closing, Toshiba Corporation retained a 5% ownership interest in TCC. In addition, d uring the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired other consolidated businesses and minority-owned businesses. The aggregate cash paid for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled $77 million and was funded through cash on hand. \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nWe may purchase our outstanding common stock from time to time subject to market conditions and at our discretion. Repurchases occur in the open market or through one or more other public or private transactions pursuant to plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. In July 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $1.75 billion increase to our existing $350 million share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $2.1 billion of our outstanding common stock. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved an additional $2.0 billion increase to our existing $2.1 billion share repurchase program. Since inception, we repurchased 42.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.9 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $2.2 billion remaining under the current authorization. \n\nDividends \n\nWe paid dividends on our common stock of $0.60 per share during the year ended December 31, 2022, totaling $509 million. On December 7, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.185 per share of common stock which represents a 23% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. It is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareowners of record at the close of business on December 22, 2022. \n\nDiscussion of Cash Flows \n\n##TABLE_START For the Years Ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,743 $ 2,237 Investing activities 1,745 (692) Financing activities (2,931) (1,562) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (56) (16) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 501 &#160; $ (33) ##TABLE_END\n\nCash flows from operating activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with our operations. Primary activities include net income from operations adjusted for non-cash transactions, working capital changes and changes in other assets and liabilities. We define working capital as the assets and liabilities, other than cash, generated through our primary operating activities. The year-over-year decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by higher working capital balances. Ongoing customer demand and an increase in safety stock led to higher inventory balances. In addition, higher account receivable balances more than offset higher accounts payable balances. \n\nCash flows from investing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with long-term assets. Primary activities include capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures and proceeds from the sale of fixed assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by investing activities was $1.7 billion. The primary driver of the inflow related to the net proceeds from the Chubb Sale. This amount was partially offset by the acquisition of TCC and several other businesses and minority-owned businesses, which totaled $506 million, net of cash acquired and $353 million of capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $692 million. The primary driver of the outflow related to the acquisition of several businesses and a minority-owned business, which totaled $366 million, net of cash acquired and $344 million of capital expenditures. \n\nCash flows from financing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with equity or borrowings. Primary activities include debt transactions, paying dividends to shareowners and the repurchase of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022 net cash used in financing activities was $2.9 billion. The primary driver of the outflow related to the payment of $1.4 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock. In addition, we settled our tender offers for $1.15 billion and paid $509 million in dividends to our common shareowners. During the year ended December 31, 2021 net cash used in financing activities was $1.6 billion. The primary drivers of the outflow resulted from the repurchase of $527 million of our common stock, the redemption of our 1.923% Notes of $500 million and the payment of $417 million in dividends to our common shareowners. \n\nSummary of Other Sources and Uses of Cash \n\nWe continue to actively manage and strengthen our business and product portfolio to meet the current and future needs of our customers. This is accomplished through research and development activities with a focus on new product development and new technology innovation as well as sustaining activities with a focus on improving existing products and reducing production costs. We also pursue potential acquisitions to complement existing products and services to enhance our product portfolio. In addition, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments to manage our business portfolio. \n\nRapid changes in legislation, regulations and government policies, including with respect to regulations intended to combat climate change, affect our operations and business in the countries, regions and localities in which we operate and sell our products. We are committed to comply with these regulations and to environmental stewardship. As a result, we have set goals to invest over $2 billion by 2030 to develop healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions that incorporate sustainable design principles and reduce lifecycle impacts. In addition, to reach our goal to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations by 2030, we expect to incur capital expenditures for climate-related projects including upgrading our facilities, equipment and controls to optimize energy efficiency, transition our energy consumption from a dependency on fossil fuels to renewable energy and expanding the electrification of our fleet vehicles. See section entitled Environmental Goals under the headings \"Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole\" for additional information. \n\nWe also have obligations related to environmental and asbestos matters, pension and post-retirement benefits and taxes. See Note 10 - Employee Benefit Plans, Note 17 - Income Taxes, and Note 23 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \n\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgement in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from management's estimates. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment or whenever there is a material change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. We test our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances occur. \n\nASC 350 provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as &#8220;step zero&#8221;) to determine whether a quantitative analysis for impairment is necessary. In performing step zero for our impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present after performing step zero, we would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate fair value. \n\nFor our 2022 impairment test, we elected to perform a quantitative test on our Commercial HVAC reporting unit prior to the TCC acquisition and the subsequent creation of a separate Global Comfort Solutions reporting unit. We utilized a discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the Commercial HVAC reporting unit prior to the reorganization , the results of which did not indicate any goodwill impairment. We then reassigned goodwill among our Commercial HVAC and Global Comfort Solutions reporting units using a relative fair value approach and performed a goodwill impairment assessment using a discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. The results did not indicate any goodwill impairment. For each test, we relied on our estimates of future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and income tax rates and explicitly addressed factors such as timing, growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting, market and geographic risk. \n\nFor the remaining goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets tests, we elected to perform qualitative step zero assessments to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets were below carrying value. We considered macroeconomic factors including global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which our reporting units operate and where the intangible assets are utilized and the forecasted growth of the global industrial products industry. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units&#8217; current results and forecasts, changes in the nature of each business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry and competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and any intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of any indefinite-lived intangible assets. Based upon our qualitative analysis, we determined that our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired. \n\nRevenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers \n\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A significant portion of our performance obligations are recognized at a point-in-time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally the time of shipment. The remaining portion of our performance obligations are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously obtains control as we perform work under a contract, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment. \n\nA performance obligation is a distinct good, service or a bundle of goods and services promised in a contract. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract spans multiple phases of a product life-cycle such as production, installation, maintenance and support. We identify performance obligations at the inception of a contract and allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. \n\nWe primarily generate revenue from the sale of products to customers and recognize revenue at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is generally based on the shipping terms of the contract. In addition, we recognize revenue on an over-time basis on installation and service contracts. For over-time performance obligations requiring the installation of equipment, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include direct costs such as labor, materials and subcontractors&#8217; costs and, where applicable, indirect costs. \n\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer. We include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount and when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In addition, we customarily offer our customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of our products in distribution channels. The principal incentive programs provide reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing for products. We account for estimated incentive payments as a reduction in sales at the time a sale is recognized. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. We review the realizability of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required and will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management&#8217;s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nEmployee Benefit Plans \n\nWe provide a range of benefit plans to eligible current and former employees. We account for our benefits plans in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation &#8211; Retirement Benefits (\"ASC 715\"), which requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension plans. The determination of the amounts associated with these benefits is performed by actuaries and dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and health care cost trends. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into Net income from operations over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. \n\nA change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the estimated sensitivity of our 2022 projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension (benefit) cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps Projected benefit obligation $ (20) $ 21 Net periodic pension (benefit) cost $ (1) $ 1 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet periodic pension (benefit) cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected return on plan assets. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased 2022 pension expense by approximately $1 million. \n\nContingent Liabilities \n\nWe are involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental (including asbestos) and legal matters. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (\"ASC 450\"), we record accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are generally based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, we accrue the minimum amount. In addition, these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. We are unable to predict the final outcome of these matters based on the information currently available. However, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nAs described in Note 23 &#8211; Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory and other matters, including asbestos claims, may arise in the ordinary course of business that subject us to claims or litigation. We have recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances in consultation with legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. See the \"Risk Factors\" section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nSee Note 3 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on our financial statements. \n\n"

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nMarket Risk and Risk Management \n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition. There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nForeign Currency Exposures. We have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets. As a result, we are exposed to exchange rate movements in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Many of our non-U.S. operations have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the respective foreign currency. We actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level; however, we do not hedge currency translation risk. \n\nIn connection with the TCC acquisition, we entered into cross currency swaps and the Japanese Term Loan Facility to fund the Yen-denominated purchase price. We designated the cross currency swaps and the Japanese Term Loan Facility as a hedge of our investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Japanese Yen in order to manage foreign currency translation risk. As a result, changes in the fair value of the cross currency swaps and the carrying value of the Japanese Term Loan Facility associated with foreign exchange rate movements are recorded in Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effective at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact. \n\nCommodity Price Exposures. We are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and when appropriate, we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure. In addition, we are exposed to fuel costs to ship our products and materials. We do not have commodity hedge contracts in place at December 31, 2022. \n\nInterest Rate Exposures. Substantially all of our long-term debt has fixed interest rates. As a result, any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations. \n\n"

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Carrier Global Corporation \n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Carrier Global Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \n\nBasis for Opinions \n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n\nAs described in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Toshiba Carrier Corporation (TCC) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded TCC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. TCC is a majority-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total net sales excluded from management&#8217;s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 7% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \n\naccepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nCritical Audit Matters \n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n\nRevenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers \n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $20,421 million of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Some of the Company&#8217;s contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract spans multiple phases of a product life-cycle such as production, installation, maintenance and support. The Company recognizes revenue when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A significant portion of the Company's performance obligations are recognized at a point-in-time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally the time of shipment. The remaining portion of the Company's performance obligations are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously obtains control as the Company performs work under a contract, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and the Company has a contractual right to payment. For over-time performance obligations requiring the installation of equipment, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount and when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In addition, the Company customarily offers its customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of its products in distribution channels. The principal incentive programs provide reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing for products. The Company accounts for estimated incentive payments as a reduction in sales at the time a sale is recognized. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition from contracts with customers is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort in performing procedures related to revenue recognized on the Company&#8217;s point-in-time and over-time contracts with customers and in evaluating evidence related to management&#8217;s determination of total estimated costs at completion for revenue recognized on an over-time basis. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process on the Company&#8217;s point-in-time and over-time contracts with customers, including controls over the determination of total estimated costs at completion for revenue recognized on an over-time basis. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating management&#8217;s significant accounting policies related to revenue recognition; (ii) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized for a sample of point-in-time revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts with customers, purchase order information, shipping documents, cash receipts, and other documentation; and (iii) evaluating and testing management&#8217;s process for determining the total estimated costs at completion for a sample of over-time revenue contracts, which included evaluating the total estimated costs at completion used by management by considering factors that can affect the accuracy of those estimates. Evaluating the total \n\nestimated costs at completion for revenue recognized on an over-time basis involved comparing the originally estimated costs and actual costs incurred, including identifying circumstances that may warrant a modification to the total estimated costs to complete. \n\nAcquisition of TCC &#8211; Valuation of Technology, Trademark, and Certain Customer Relationships Intangible Assets \n\nAs described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 1, 2022, the Company acquired a majority ownership interest in TCC for $930 million, which resulted in the recognition of intangible assets including $220 million of technology, $180 million of trademark, and $497 million of customer relationships. The valuation of intangible assets was determined using an income approach methodology including the multi-period excess earnings method and the relief from royalty method. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth rates, earnings before interest and taxes (&#8220;EBIT&#8221;) margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates, among others. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of technology, trademark, and certain customer relationships intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of TCC is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the technology, trademark, and certain customer relationships intangible assets; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management&#8217;s significant assumptions related to certain royalty rates used in the valuation of the technology, the discount rate and royalty rate used in the valuation of the trademark, and certain projected revenue growth rates, EBIT margins, discount rates, and customer attrition rates used in the valuation of certain customer relationships; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to business combination accounting, including controls over management&#8217;s valuation of the technology, trademark, and certain customer relationships intangible assets and controls over the development of significant assumptions related to projected revenue growth rates, EBIT margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates, as applicable to the respective intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement and (ii) testing management&#8217;s process for developing the fair value estimate of the technology, trademark, and certain customer relationships intangible assets. Testing management&#8217;s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant assumptions. Evaluating management&#8217;s assumptions related to certain projected revenue growth rates and EBIT margins involved considering TCC&#8217;s historical performance, consistency with economic and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s valuation methods and the evaluation of the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to discount rates, customer attrition rates, and certain royalty rates. \n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n\nHallandale Beach, Florida \n\nFebruary 7, 2023 \n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019. \n\nCARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS \n\n##TABLE_START For the Year Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales Product sales $ 18,250 &#160;

The Company's portfolio includes industry-leading brands such as Carrier, Toshiba, Automated Logic, Carrier Transicold, Kidde, Edwards and LenelS2 that offer innovative heating, ventilating and air conditioning (\"HVAC\"), refrigeration, fire, security and building automation technologies to help make the world safer and more comfortable. The Company also provides a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance and monitoring. The Company's operations are classified into three segments: HVAC, Refrigeration and Fire &#38; Security. \n\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic \n\nIn early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory disease known as COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In response, many countries implemented containment and mitigation measures to combat the outbreak, which severely restricted the level of economic activity and caused a significant contraction in the global economy. As a result, the Company took several preemptive actions to manage liquidity, preserve the health and safety of its employees and customers as well as maintain the continuity of its operations. The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period, which can have a significant effect on reported amounts. However, due to significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, including a resurgence in cases and the spread of COVID-19 variants, management's judgments could change. While the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted, the extent of any continuing impact cannot be estimated with certainty at this time. \n\nNOTE 2: BASIS OF PRESENTATION \n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"). Inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Related party transactions between the Company and its equity method investees have not been eliminated. Certain immaterial amounts presented in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. \n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company. A non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest in a majority-owned subsidiary that is not attributable to the parent. The Company includes Non-controlling interest as a component of Total equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries' earnings from operations are presented as an adjustment to Net income from operations used to arrive at Net income attributable to common shareowners in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. Partially-owned equity affiliates represent 20 to 50% ownership interests in investments where the Company demonstrates significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. Partially-owned equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method. \n\nAcquisition of Toshiba Carrier Corporation \n\nOn February 6, 2022, the Company entered into a binding agreement to acquire a majority ownership interest in Toshiba Carrier Corporation (&#8220;TCC&#8221;), a variable refrigerant flow (\"VRF\") and light commercial HVAC joint venture between Carrier and Toshiba Corporation. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2022. As a result, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of TCC are consolidated in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as of the date of acquisition and reported within the Company&#8217;s HVAC segment. Upon closing, Toshiba Corporation retained a 5 % ownership interest in TCC. See Note 19 - Acquisitions for additional information. \n\nSale of Chubb Fire &#38; Security Business \n\nOn July 26, 2021, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell its Chubb Fire and Security business (\"Chubb\") to APi Group Corporation (\"APi\"). As a result, the assets and liabilities of Chubb are presented as held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 and recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less estimated cost to sell. The sale of Chubb was completed on January 3, 2022 (the \"Chubb Sale\"). See Note 20 - Divestitures for additional information. \n\nSeparation from United Technologies \n\nOn April 3, 2020 (the \"Distribution Date\"), United Technologies Corporation, since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation (\"UTC\"), completed the spin-off of the Company into an independent, publicly traded company (the \"Separation\") through a pro rata distribution (the \"Distribution\") on a one -for-one basis of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the Distribution. In connection with the Separation, the Company issued an aggregate principal balance of $ 11.0 billion of debt and transferred approximately $ 10.9 billion of cash to UTC on February 27, 2020 and March 27, 2020. On April 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, the Company received cash contributions totaling $ 590 million from UTC related to the Separation. \n\nThe Company's financial statements for the periods prior to the Separation and the Distribution are prepared on a \"carve-out\" basis and include all amounts directly attributable to the Company. Net cash transfers and other property transferred between UTC and the Company, including related party receivables and payables between the Company and other UTC affiliates, are presented as Net transfers to UTC within UTC Net Investment in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the financial statements include allocations of costs for administrative functions and services performed on behalf of the Company by centralized groups within UTC. All allocations and estimates in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The allocated centralized costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $ 43 million and are primarily included in Selling, general and administrative in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nThe Company's financial statements for the periods subsequent to April 3, 2020 are consolidated financial statements based on the reported results of Carrier as a stand-alone company. Following the Separation and Distribution, the Company entered into several agreements with UTC and Otis Worldwide Corporation (\"Otis\") that govern various aspects of the relationship among the Company, UTC and Otis. As of December 31, 2022, only the Tax Matters Agreement (\"TMA\") remains in effect. In addition, the Company incurred separation-related costs of $ 20 million and $ 141 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These costs are primarily included in Selling, general and administrative in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and consist of employee-related costs, costs to establish certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems, professional service fees and other transaction-related costs resulting from Carrier&#8217;s transition to becoming an independent, publicly traded company. \n\nNOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\nA summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows: \n\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made, historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n\nCurrency Translation . Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange rates, and income and expense accounts have been translated using average exchange rates throughout the year. Adjustments resulting from the process of translating an entity&#8217;s financial statements into the U.S. dollar have been recorded in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) . Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity&#8217;s functional currency are subject to changes in exchange rates with the resulting gains and losses recorded in Net income from operations . \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. On occasion, the Company is required to maintain restricted cash deposits with certain banks due to contractual or other legal obligations. Restricted cash of $ 7 million and $ 39 million is included in Other assets, current as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nAccounts Receivable. Accounts receivable consist of billed amounts owed for products shipped to or services performed for customers. Amounts are recorded net of an allowance for expected credit losses which represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent in the Company's accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance is determined using a combination of factors including a reserve based on the aging of the outstanding accounts receivable portfolio and the Company's historical credit loss experience with its end markets, customer base and products. In addition, the Company considers knowledge of specific customers, current market conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for expected credit losses was $ 117 million and $ 88 million, respectively. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically with the effects of changes, if any, reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period that they are determined. \n\nFixed Assets. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Major expenditures for replacements and significant improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful life of an asset are charged to expense as incurred. \n\nPer ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (\"ASC 360\"), the Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. \n\nEquity Method Investments. Investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under this method of accounting, the Company&#8217;s share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is presented within Operating profit on the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the Company. The Company evaluates its equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Distributions received from equity method investees are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows based on the cumulative earnings approach. \n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. The Company records goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles are tested and reviewed annually for impairment on July 1 or whenever there is a material change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. \n\nImpairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test under ASC 350. For those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment, the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit. \n\nIntangible assets such as patents, service contracts, monitoring lines and customer relationships with finite useful lives are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined or if straight-line amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit, a straight-line amortization may be used. \n\nThe range of useful lives approximate the following (in years): \n\n##TABLE_START Customer relationships 1 to 30 \n\nPatents and trademarks 5 to 30 \n\nMonitoring lines 7 to 10 \n\nService portfolio and other 1 to 23 \n\n##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount of its intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. \n\nLeases. The Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), which requires a lessee to record a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on information available at the lease commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments except when an implicit interest rate is readily determinable. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. \n\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required and will adjust its estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the Company's original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company's income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management&#8217;s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nPrior to the Separation, the Company&#8217;s income tax provision was prepared following the separate return methodology. The separate return method applies ASC 740 to the financial statements of each member of a consolidated group as if the group members were separate taxpayers. As a result, certain operations of the Company were included in a consolidated return with other UTC entities. The calculation of the Company's income taxes on a separate return basis requires a considerable amount of judgment and use of both estimates and allocations. See Note 17 &#8211; Income Taxes for additional information. \n\nPension and Post-retirement Obligations. The Company provides a range of benefit plans to eligible current and former employees. The Company accounts for its benefit plans in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (\"ASC 715\") which requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and post-retirement benefit plans. Determining the amounts associated with these benefits are performed by actuaries and dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and health care cost trends. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into Net income from operations over future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. See Note 10 &#8211; Employee Benefit Plans for additional information. \n\nBusiness Combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. We recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest as of the acquisition date at fair value. The valuation of intangible assets is determined by an income approach methodology, using assumptions such as projected future revenues, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, tax rates and discount rates. The excess, if any, of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest is recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations. The Company records the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which a liability is determined to exist, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the Company capitalizes the cost of the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is increased for changes in its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. \n\nResearch and Development . The Company conducts research and development activities with a focus on new product development and technology innovation. These costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, these costs amounted to $ 539 million, $ 503 million and $ 419 million, respectively. \n\nRecent Pronouncements \n\nThe FASB ASC is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC') issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues Accounting Standards Updates (\"ASU\") to communicate changes to the codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not referenced below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and SEC Rules \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which updates the current guidance to require that an entity recognize and measure contract asset and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition. The guidance eliminates the complexity of determining the fair value of contract liabilities and will likely increase the balance of contract liabilities acquired in a business combination with a corresponding increase in post-combination revenue recognized by the acquirer. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. In October 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The amendments in this update remove certain exceptions allowed by Topic 740 including exceptions to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or gain from other items, the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment, the ability not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary and the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. There are also additional areas of guidance in regards to franchise and other taxes partially based on income and the interim recognition of enactment of tax laws and rate changes. The provisions of this ASU were effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn May 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10786, which amends the financial statement requirements for acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and related pro forma financial information required under SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 3-05. The final rule modifies the significance test required in SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 1-02(w) by raising the significance threshold for reporting dispositions of a business from 10% to 20% and by modifying the calculation of the investment and income tests. In accordance with Rules 3-09 or 4-08(g), the revised income test will apply to the evaluation of equity method investments for significance. The Company adopted these modifications, which were effective for fiscal years \n\nbeginning after December 31, 2020. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nIn November 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10980, which amends the requirements for providing selected quarterly financial data, contractual obligations and management discussion and analysis. These modifications were required after August 9, 2021. The Company applied the requirements of this release in its 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nNOTE 4: INVENTORIES, NET \n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is primarily determined based on the first-in, first-out inventory method (\"FIFO\") or average cost methods, which approximates current replacement cost. However, certain Carrier entities use the last-in, first-out inventory method (\"LIFO\"). \n\nInventories, net consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Raw materials $ 884 &#160; $ 559 &#160; Work-in-process 230 &#160; 197 &#160; Finished goods 1,526 &#160; 1,214 &#160; Inventories, net $ 2,640 &#160; $ 1,970 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company performs periodic assessments utilizing customer demand, production requirements and historical usage rates to determine the existence of excess and obsolete inventory and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods are net of valuation reserves of $ 190 million and $ 154 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nCertain entities use LIFO to determine the cost of inventory. If inventories that were valued using the LIFO method had been valued under the FIFO method, the net book value of the inventories would have been higher by $ 199 million and $ 141 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 26 % and 31 %, respectively, of all inventory utilized the LIFO method. \n\nNOTE 5: FIXED ASSETS, NET \n\nFixed assets, net consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Estimated Useful Lives (Years) 2022 2021 Land $ 126 &#160; $ 114 &#160; Buildings and improvements 20 to 40 \n\n1,251 &#160; 1,084 &#160; Machinery, tools and equipment 3 to 25 \n\n2,409 &#160; 2,093 &#160; Rental assets 3 to 12 \n\n390 &#160; 381 &#160; Other, including assets under construction 347 &#160; 304 &#160; Fixed assets, gross 4,523 &#160; 3,976 &#160; Accumulated depreciation ( 2,282 ) ( 2,150 ) Fixed assets, net $ 2,241 &#160; $ 1,826 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nDepreciation expense was $ 256 million, $ 238 million and $ 234 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nNOTE 6: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n\nThe Company records goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested and reviewed annually for impairment on July 1 or whenever there is a material change in events or circumstances that indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. \n\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) HVAC Refrigeration Fire &#38; Security Total Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 5,489 &#160; $ 1,251 &#160; $ 3,399 &#160; $ 10,139 &#160; \n\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations (1) \n\n261 &#160; ( 1 ) 60 &#160; 320 &#160; Reclassified to held for sale (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 940 ) ( 940 ) Foreign currency translation ( 92 ) ( 22 ) ( 56 ) ( 170 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 5,658 &#160; $ 1,228 &#160; $ 2,463 &#160; $ 9,349 &#160; Goodwill resulting from business combinations (1) \n\n904 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 905 &#160; Foreign currency translation ( 170 ) ( 31 ) ( 76 ) ( 277 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 6,392 &#160; $ 1,197 &#160; $ 2,388 &#160; $ 9,977 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See Note 19 - Acquisitions for additional information. \n\n(2) See Note 20 - Divestitures for additional information. \n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment on July 1 or whenever there is a material change in events or circumstances that indicates that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. All other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. \n\nIdentifiable intangible assets consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (In millions) Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Amount Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Amount Amortized: Customer relationships $ 1,431 &#160; $ ( 720 ) $ 711 &#160; $ 945 &#160; $ ( 699 ) $ 246 &#160; Patents and trademarks 401 &#160; ( 191 ) 210 &#160; 232 &#160; ( 182 ) 50 &#160; Service portfolios and other 953 &#160; ( 595 ) 358 &#160; 688 &#160; ( 539 ) 149 &#160; 2,785 &#160; ( 1,506 ) 1,279 &#160; 1,865 &#160; ( 1,420 ) 445 &#160; Unamortized: Trademarks and other 63 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 63 &#160; 64 &#160; &#8212; 64 &#160; Intangible assets, net $ 2,848 &#160; $ ( 1,506 ) $ 1,342 &#160; $ 1,929 &#160; $ ( 1,420 ) $ 509 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAmortization of intangible assets was $ 124 million, $ 98 million and $ 102 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nThe estimated future amortization of intangible assets is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Future amortization $ 246 &#160; $ 194 &#160; $ 170 &#160; $ 136 &#160; $ 99 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAnnual Impairment Assessment \n\nThe Company tested its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as part of its annual assessment. For each test except one, the Company qualitatively assessed all relevant events or circumstances that could impact the estimate of fair value and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded their carrying amount. The remaining test related to the TCC acquisition and the subsequent reorganization of the Company's Commercial HVAC reporting unit in order to create a separate Global Comfort Solutions reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test on its Commercial HVAC reporting unit prior to the reorganization, the results of which did not indicate any goodwill impairment. The Company then reassigned goodwill among its Commercial HVAC and Global Comfort Solutions reporting units using a relative fair value approach and performed a goodwill impairment assessment. The results did not indicate any goodwill impairment. \n\nNOTE 7: BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT \n\nLong-term debt consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\n2.242 % Notes due February 15, 2025 \n\n1,200 &#160; 2,000 &#160; \n\n2.493 % Notes due February 15, 2027 \n\n900 &#160; 1,250 &#160; \n\n2.722 % Notes due February 15, 2030 \n\n2,000 &#160; 2,000 &#160; \n\n2.700 % Notes due February 15, 2031 \n\n750 &#160; 750 &#160; \n\n3.377 % Notes due April 5, 2040 \n\n1,500 &#160; 1,500 &#160; \n\n3.577 % Notes due April 5, 2050 \n\n2,000 &#160; 2,000 &#160; Total long-term notes 8,350 &#160; 9,500 &#160; Japanese Term Loan Facility 404 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other debt (including project financing obligations and finance leases) 149 &#160; 267 &#160; Discounts and debt issuance costs ( 61 ) ( 71 ) Total debt 8,842 &#160; 9,696 &#160; Less: current portion of long-term debt 140 &#160; 183 &#160; Long-term debt, net of current portion $ 8,702 &#160; $ 9,513 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nJapanese Term Loan Facility \n\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year , JPY 54 billion (approximately $ 400 million) senior unsecured term loan facility with MUFG Bank Ltd., as administrative agent and lender, and certain other lenders (the \"Japanese Term Loan Facility\"). Borrowings under the Japanese Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the Tokyo Term Risk Free Rate plus 0.75 %. In addition, the Japanese Term Loan Facility is subject to customary covenants including a covenant to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. On July 25, 2022, the Company borrowed JPY 54 billion under the Japanese Term Loan Facility and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the TCC acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. \n\nRevolving Credit Facility \n\nOn February 10, 2020, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $ 2.0 billion pursuant to an unsecured, unsubordinated revolving credit facility that matures on April 3, 2025 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Revolving Credit Facility supports the Company's commercial paper program and cash requirements of the Company. A commitment fee of 0.125 % is charged on unused commitments. Borrowings under t he Revolving Credit Facility are available in U.S. Dollars, Euros and Pounds Sterling. Pounds Sterling borrowings bear interest at a variable interest rate based on daily simple SONIA plus 0.0326 % , Euro borrowings bear interest at EURIBOR rates and U.S. Dollar borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus a ratings-based margin, which was 125 basis points as of December 31, 2022 . As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\nCommercial Paper Program \n\nThe Company has a $ 2.0 billion unsecured, unsubordinated commercial paper program, which can be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of working capital and potential acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program. \n\nProject Financing Arrangements \n\nThe Company is involved in long-term construction contracts in which it arranges project financing with certain customers. As a result, the Company issued $ 38 million and $ 124 million of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term debt repayments associated with these financing arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 160 million and $ 181 million, respectively. \n\nDebt Covenants \n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility, the indenture for the long-term Notes and the Japanese Term Loan Facility contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of these types, which, among other things, limit the Company's ability to incur additional liens, to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of December 31, 2022, t he Company was in compliance with the covenants under the agreements governing its outstanding indebtedness. \n\nTender Offers \n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Company commenced tender offers to purchase up to $ 1.15 billion (\"Aggregate Tender Cap\") aggregate principal of the Company's 2.242 % Notes due 2025 and 2.493 % Notes due 2027 (together, the \"Senior Notes\"). The tender offers included payment of applicable accrued and unpaid interest up to the settlement date, along with a fixed spread for early repayment. Based on participation, the Company elected to settle the tender offers on March 30, 2022. The aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes validly tendered and accepted was approximately $ 1.15 billion, which included $ 800 million of Notes due 2025 and $ 350 million of Notes due 2027. As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of $ 33 million and wrote off $ 5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs within Interest (expense) income, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nSchedule of Long-term Debt Maturities \n\nScheduled maturities of long-term debt, excluding amortization of discount, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2023 $ 140 &#160; 2024 $ 2 &#160; 2025 $ 1,202 &#160; 2026 $ 2 &#160; 2027 $ 1,306 &#160; Thereafter $ 6,251 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the average maturity of the Company's long-term notes is approximate l y 12 years and the weighted-average interest rate on its total borrowings is approximately 2.9 %. Interest expense associated with long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 302 million, $ 319 million and $ 298 million, respectively. \n\nNOTE 8 : FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \n\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"), defines fair value as the price that would be received if an asset is sold or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as follows: \n\n&#8226; Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; \n\n&#8226; Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and \n\n&#8226; Level 3: Unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. \n\nASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors, including foreign currency and commodity price risk. These exposures are managed through operational strategies and the use of undesignated hedging contracts. The Company's derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using internal models based on observable market inputs, such as forward, interest, contract and discount rates with changes in fair value reported in earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nIn connection with the TCC acquisition, the Company funded a portion of the Yen-denominated purchase price with cash on hand by entering into cross currency swaps with SMBC Capital Markets, Inc., as syndication swap arranger, and certain other financial institutions. The fair value of the cross currency swaps are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using observable market inputs, such as forward, discount and interest rates as well as credit default swap spreads. The Company designated the cross currency swaps as a partial hedge of its investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Japanese Yen in order to manage foreign currency translation risk. As a result, changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in Equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe remaining portion of the Yen-denominated purchase price was funded by the Japanese Term Loan Facility. The carrying value of the facility is translated on a recurring basis using the exchange rate at the end of the applicable period and approximates its fair value. The Company designated the Japanese Term Loan Facility as a partial hedge of its investment in certain subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Japanese Yen in order to manage foreign currency translation risk. As a result, changes in the carrying value of the Japanese Term Loan Facility associated with foreign exchange rate movements are recorded in Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe following tables provide the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value and measured on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2022 Fair value measurement: Derivative assets (1)(3) \n\n$ 28 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative liabilities (2)(3) \n\n$ ( 48 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 48 ) $ &#8212; &#160; December 31, 2021 Fair value measurement: Derivative assets (1) \n\n$ 8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Derivative liabilities (2) \n\n$ ( 35 ) $ &#8212; &#160; $ ( 35 ) $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Included in Other assets, current on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n(2) Included in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n(3) Includes cross currency swaps. \n\nThe following table provides the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's long-term notes that are not recorded at fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 (In millions) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value \n\nTotal long-term notes (1) \n\n$ 8,350 &#160; $ 6,832 &#160; $ 9,500 &#160; $ 9,842 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Excludes debt discount and issuance costs. ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nThe fair value of the Company's long-term debt is measured based on observable market inputs which are considered Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts and would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company's financing leases and project financing obligations, included in Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, approximate fair value and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. \n\nNOTE 9: LEASES \n\nThe Company enters into operating and finance leases for the use of real estate space, vehicles, information technology equipment and certain other equipment. At contract inception, the Company determines a lease exists if the arrangement conveys the right to control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is considered to exist when the lessee has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset as well as the right to direct the use of that asset. If a contract is considered to be a lease, the Company recognizes a lease liability based on \n\nthe present value of the future lease payments with an offsetting entry to recognize a ROU asset. \n\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 642 &#160; $ 640 &#160; Accrued liabilities $ ( 132 ) $ ( 130 ) Operating lease liabilities ( 529 ) ( 527 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ ( 661 ) $ ( 657 ) Weighted-Average Remaining Lease Term (in years) 7.7 7.8 Weighted-Average Discount Rate 3.4 &#160; % 3.0 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe operating lease ROU assets include any lease payments related to initial direct costs and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. The Company's leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 26 years, some of which include options to extend. For the majority of its leases with options to extend, those options are up to 5 years with the ability to terminate the lease within 1 to 5 years of inception. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and its lease ROU assets and liabilities reflect only the options the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise. \n\nSupplemental cash flow and lease expense information related to operating leases were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating cash flows for measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 145 &#160; $ 197 &#160; $ 213 &#160; Operating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 109 &#160; $ 180 &#160; $ 169 &#160; Operating lease expense $ 148 &#160; $ 200 &#160; $ 197 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Where applicable, the Company accounts for each separate lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease component as a single lease component. \n\nUndiscounted maturities of operating lease liabilities, including options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised, as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2023 $ 153 &#160; 2024 132 &#160; 2025 106 &#160; 2026 83 &#160; 2027 59 &#160; Thereafter 231 &#160; Total undiscounted lease payments 764 &#160; Less: imputed interest ( 103 ) Total discounted lease payments $ 661 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 10: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \n\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded domestic and international defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans. In addition, the Company contributes to various domestic and international multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. \n\nPension Plans \n\nQualified domestic pension plan benefits covering collectively bargained U.S. employees comprise approximately 29 % of the projected benefit obligation. This noncontributory defined benefit plan provides benefits on a flat dollar formula based on an employee's location and is closed to new entrants. The non-U.S. plans comprise approximately 71 % of the projected benefit obligation; certain of these plans provide participants with one-time payments upon separation of employment rather than a retirement annuity. These plans provide benefits based on a plan specific benefit formula. Non-qualified domestic pension plans provide supplementary retirement benefits to certain employees and are not a material component of the projected benefit obligation. \n\nThe following table details information regarding the Company's pension plans: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Change in Benefit Obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 906 &#160; $ 3,224 &#160; Service cost 20 &#160; 27 &#160; Interest cost 18 &#160; 37 &#160; Actuarial (gain) loss (1) \n\n( 271 ) ( 112 ) Benefits paid ( 21 ) ( 106 ) Curtailment, settlements and special termination benefits ( 7 ) ( 54 ) Other, including expenses paid ( 38 ) ( 48 ) Liabilities held for sale (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 2,062 ) Acquisitions (3) \n\n153 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Benefit obligation at end of year $ 760 &#160; $ 906 &#160; Change in Plan Assets Fair value at beginning of year $ 591 &#160; $ 3,294 &#160; Actual return on plan assets ( 170 ) 67 &#160; Company contributions 16 &#160; 47 &#160; Benefits paid ( 21 ) ( 106 ) Settlements ( 7 ) ( 54 ) Other, including expenses paid ( 18 ) ( 34 ) Assets held for sale (2) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 2,623 ) Acquisitions (3) \n\n60 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Fair value of assets end of year $ 451 &#160; $ 591 &#160; Funded status of plans $ ( 309 ) $ ( 315 ) Amounts included in the balance sheet: Other non-current assets $ 25 &#160; $ 43 &#160; Accrued compensation and benefits ( 18 ) ( 10 ) Post-employment and other benefit liabilities ( 316 ) ( 348 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 309 ) $ ( 315 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Reflects the impact of foreign exchange translation, primarily for plans in the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. \n\n(2) See Note 20 - Divestitures for additional information. \n\n(3) See Note 19 - Acquisitions for additional information. \n\nAll plans experienced an improvement in the net deficit position due to a significant increase in the discount rates used to measure the benefit obligations of the plans. Discount rates increased over the measurement period as a result of increases in corporate bond yields. The reduction in the benefit obligation was partially offset by lower plan asset performance. In addition, the acquisition of TCC on August 1, 2022 contributed to the change in the funded position. \n\nThe pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss are: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Prior Service Cost (Benefit) Net Actuarial (Gain) Loss Total As of December 31, 2021 $ 15 &#160; $ 595 &#160; $ 610 &#160; Current year changes recorded in AOCI ( 2 ) ( 476 ) ( 478 ) Amortization reclassified to earnings ( 2 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) Settlement/curtailment reclassified to earnings &#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Currency translation and other &#8212; &#160; ( 15 ) ( 15 ) As of December 31, 2022 $ 11 &#160; $ 93 &#160; $ 104 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInformation for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 564 &#160; $ 405 &#160; Accumulated benefit obligation $ 538 &#160; $ 374 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ 230 &#160; $ 47 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nInformation for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 564 &#160; $ 405 &#160; Accumulated benefit obligation $ 538 &#160; $ 374 &#160; Fair value of plan assets $ 230 &#160; $ 47 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe components of net periodic pension expense (benefit) for the defined benefit pension plans are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 (1) \n\n2021 2020 Service cost $ 20 &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ 29 &#160; Interest cost 18 &#160; 37 &#160; 52 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 27 ) ( 145 ) ( 140 ) Amortization of prior service cost 2 &#160; 2 &#160; 2 &#160; Recognized actuarial net loss 9 &#160; 32 &#160; 22 &#160; Net settlement, curtailment and special termination benefit loss 2 &#160; 13 &#160; 4 &#160; Net periodic pension expense (benefit) $ 24 &#160; $ ( 34 ) $ ( 31 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) See Note 20 - Divestitures for additional information. \n\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \n\nMajor assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation and net cost for pension plans are presented in the following table as weighted-averages: \n\n##TABLE_START Benefit Obligation Net Costs 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate Projected benefit obligation 4.2 % 2.1 &#160; % 2.1 % 1.4 &#160; % 2.0 &#160; % Interest cost (1) \n\n&#8212;% &#8212; % 1.9 % 1.2 &#160; % 1.8 &#160; % Service cost (1) \n\n&#8212;% &#8212; % 2.8 % 2.1 &#160; % 1.8 &#160; % Salary scale 2.4 % 3.1 &#160; % 3.1 % 2.8 &#160; % 3.3 &#160; % Expected return on plan assets &#8212;% &#8212; % 5.0 % 4.6 &#160; % 4.9 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The 2022 and 2021 discount rates used to measure the service cost and interest cost applies to the significant plans of the Company. The projected benefit obligation discount rate is used for the service cost and interest cost measurements for non-significant plans. \n\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension benefit obligations and net costs are set by reference to specific analyses using each plan&#8217;s specific cash flows and high-quality bond indices to assess reasonableness. For those significant plans, the Company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. \n\nIn determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considered the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance. Return projections are assessed for reasonableness using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. \n\nThe plans&#8217; investment management objectives include providing the liquidity and asset levels needed to meet current and future benefit payments, while maintaining a prudent degree of portfolio diversification considering interest rate risk and market volatility. Globally, investment strategies target a mix of approximately 50 % of growth seeking assets and 50 % of income generating and hedging assets using a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and investment managers. The growth seeking allocation consists of global public equities in developed and emerging countries and alternative-asset class strategies. Within the income generating assets, the fixed income portfolio primarily consists of government and broadly diversified high quality corporate bonds. \n\nThe plans seek to reduce interest rate risk and have incorporated liability hedging programs that include the adoption of a risk reduction objective as part of the long-term investment strategy. Under this objective, the income generating and hedging assets typically increase as funded status improves. The hedging programs incorporate a range of assets and investment tools, each with various interest rate sensitivities. As a result of the improved funded status of the plans, due to favorable asset returns and funding of the plans, the income generating and hedging assets increased in recent years. \n\nThe fair values of pension plan assets by asset category are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs Not Subject (In millions) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) to Leveling Total Asset Category Public Equities: Global Equities $ &#8212; &#160; $ 27 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; $ 27 &#160; Global Equity Funds at net asset value (1) (2) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 119 &#160; 119 &#160; Fixed Income Securities: Governments &#8212; &#160; 35 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 24 &#160; 59 &#160; Corporate Bonds &#8212; &#160; 45 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 45 &#160; \n\nFixed Income Securities (2) \n\n&#8212; 11 &#160; &#8212; 156 &#160; 167 &#160; \n\nReal Estate (3) \n\n&#8212; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 1 &#160; \n\nOther (4) (5) \n\n&#8212; 8 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 8 &#160; \n\nCash &#38; Cash Equivalents (2)(6) \n\n&#8212; 25 &#160; &#8212; 1 &#160; 26 &#160; Subtotal $ &#8212; &#160; $ 152 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 300 &#160; $ 452 &#160; \n\nOther assets and liabilities (7) \n\n( 1 ) \n\nTotal as of December 31, 2022 \n\n$ 451 &#160; Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs Not Subject (In millions) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) to Leveling Total Asset Category Public Equities: Global Equities $ &#8212; &#160; $ 29 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; $ 29 &#160; Global Equity Funds at net asset value (1) (2) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 208 &#160; 208 &#160; Fixed Income Securities: Governments &#8212; &#160; 26 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 26 &#160; Corporate Bonds &#8212; &#160; 103 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 103 &#160; \n\nFixed Income Securities (2) \n\n&#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 189 &#160; 189 &#160; \n\nReal Estate (3) \n\n&#8212; 9 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; 9 &#160; \n\nOther (4)(5) \n\n&#8212; 5 &#160; &#8212; &#8212; 5 &#160; \n\nCash &#38; Cash Equivalents (2)(6) \n\n&#8212; 7 &#160; &#8212; 3 &#160; 10 &#160; Subtotal $ &#8212; &#160; $ 179 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 400 &#160; $ 579 &#160; \n\nOther assets and liabilities (7) \n\n12 &#160; \n\nTotal as of December 31, 2021 (8) \n\n$ 591 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents commingled funds that invest primarily in common stocks. \n\n(2) In accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) , certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension plan assets. \n\n(3) Represents investments in real estate, including commingled funds and directly held properties. \n\n(4) Represents insurance contracts and global balanced risk commingled funds consisting mainly of equity, bonds and some commodities. \n\n(5) Includes fixed income repurchase agreements entered into for purposes of pension asset and liability matching. \n\n(6) Represents short-term commercial paper, bonds and other cash or cash-like instruments. \n\n(7) Represents trust receivables and payables that are not leveled. \n\n(8) Chubb plan assets for 2021, totaling $ 2.6 billion are not included within this table, as the business was reclassified as held for sale. \n\nDerivatives in the plan are primarily used to manage risk and gain asset class exposure while still maintaining liquidity. Derivative instruments mainly consist of fixed income repurchase agreements, interest rate swaps, total return swaps and currency forward contracts. \n\nQuoted market prices are used to value investments when available. Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the \n\nlast reported bid prices. Fixed income securities are primarily measured using a market approach pricing methodology, whereby observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Over-the-counter securities and government obligations are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable, including broker quotes. Temporary cash investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. \n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company made $ 16 million, $ 47 million and $ 41 million, respectively, of cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The Company expects to make total contributions of approximately $ 5 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2023. Contributions do not reflect benefits to be paid directly from corporate assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from corporate assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: $ 38 million in 2023, $ 38 million in 2024, $ 40 million in 2025, $ 45 million in 2026, $ 50 million in 2027 and $ 243 million from 2028 through 2031. \n\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans \n\nThe Company contributes to various domestic and foreign multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from those of single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. The Company's contributions to these plans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 15 million and $ 14 million, respectively. ##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END\n\nEmployee Savings Plans \n\nThe Company sponsors various employee savings plans. Certain employees of Carrier participate in these plans. Carrier&#8217;s contributions to employer sponsored defined contribution plans were $ 123 million, $ 115 million and $ 103 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nNOTE 11: PRODUCT WARRANTIES \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company provides standard warranty coverage on its products. Provisions for these amounts are established at the time of sale and estimated primarily based on product warranty terms and historical claims experience. In addition, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with specific product performance issues. Provisions for these amounts are established when they are known and estimable. The Company assesses the adequacy of its initial provisions and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated claims or as new information becomes available that suggests it is probable that future costs will be different than estimated amounts. Amounts associated with these provisions are classified on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as Accrued liabilities or Other long-term liabilities based on their anticipated settlement date. \n\nThe changes is the carrying amount of warranty related provisions are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Balance as of January 1, $ 524 &#160; $ 514 &#160; Warranties, performance guarantees issued and changes in estimated liability 184 &#160; 172 &#160; Settlements made ( 171 ) ( 165 ) Other 14 &#160; 3 &#160; Balance as of December 31, $ 551 &#160; $ 524 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 12: EQUITY \n\nThe authorized number of shares of common stock of Carrier is 4,000,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 876,487,480 and 873,064,219 shares of common stock were issued, respectively, which includes 42,103,995 and 10,375,654 shares of treasury stock, respectively. \n\nShare Repurchase Program \n\nThe Company may purchase its outstanding common stock from time to time subject to market conditions and at our discretion. Repurchases occur in the open market or through one or more other public or private transactions pursuant to plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. Shares acquired are recognized at cost and presented separately on the balance sheet as a reduction to Equity . In July 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $ 1.75 billion increase to the Company's existing $ 350 million share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $ 2.1 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. During 2021, the Company repurchased 10.4 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $ 529 million. \n\nOn December 14, 2021, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (\"ASR Agreement\") to repurchase $ 500 million of its common stock pursuant to the Company's existing share repurchase program. In accordance with the ASR Agreement, the Company received initial delivery of 7.6 million shares on January 4, 2022, representing approximately 80 % of the expected share repurchases. The final number of shares under the ASR Agreement was based on the daily average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock over the term of the ASR Agreement. Upon final settlement, the Company received an additional 2.7 million shares on February 8, 2022 and recognized $ 500 million in Treasury stock as a reduction in equity. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $ 2 billion increase to the Company's existing share repurchase program in October 2022. \n\nDuring 2022, the Company repurchased 31.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $ 1.4 billion, which includes shares repurchased under the ASR Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $ 2.2 billion remaining under the current authorization. \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) \n\nA summary of changes in the components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Foreign Currency Translation Defined Benefit Pension and Post-retirement Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Balance as of January 1, 2020 $ ( 780 ) $ ( 473 ) $ ( 1,253 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 589 &#160; 2 &#160; 591 &#160; Amounts reclassified, pre-tax &#8212; &#160; ( 105 ) ( 105 ) Tax benefit reclassified &#8212; &#160; 22 &#160; 22 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ ( 191 ) $ ( 554 ) $ ( 745 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net ( 322 ) 53 &#160; ( 269 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax 8 &#160; 34 &#160; 42 &#160; Tax benefit reclassified &#8212; &#160; ( 17 ) ( 17 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ ( 505 ) $ ( 484 ) $ ( 989 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net ( 525 ) 63 &#160; ( 462 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax &#8212; &#160; 11 &#160; 11 &#160; Tax benefit reclassified &#8212; &#160; ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Chubb divestiture ( 574 ) 329 &#160; ( 245 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ ( 1,604 ) $ ( 84 ) $ ( 1,688 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 13: REVENUE RECOGNITION \n\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A significant portion of the Company's performance obligations are recognized at a point-in-time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally the time of shipment. The remaining portion of the Company&#8217;s performance obligations are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously obtains control as the Company performs work under a contract, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and the Company has a contractual right to payment. \n\nPerformance Obligations \n\nA performance obligation is a distinct good, service or a bundle of goods and services promised in a contract. Some of the Company's contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract spans multiple phases of a product life-cycle such as production, installation, maintenance and support. The Company identifies performance obligations at the inception of a contract and allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. \n\nThe Company primarily generates revenue from the sale of products to customers and recognizes revenue at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is generally based on the shipping terms of the contract. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue on an over-time basis on installation and service contracts. For over-time performance obligations requiring the installation of equipment, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include direct costs such as labor, materials and subcontractors&#8217; costs and where applicable, indirect costs. \n\nSegment sales disaggregated by product and service are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Sales Type Product $ 11,882 &#160; $ 9,985 &#160; $ 8,165 &#160; Service 1,526 &#160; 1,405 &#160; 1,313 &#160; HVAC sales 13,408 &#160; 11,390 &#160; 9,478 &#160; Product 3,432 &#160; 3,653 &#160; 2,927 &#160; Service 451 &#160; 474 &#160; 406 &#160; Refrigeration sales 3,883 &#160; 4,127 &#160; 3,333 &#160; Product 3,372 &#160; 3,985 &#160; 3,585 &#160; Service 198 &#160; 1,530 &#160; 1,400 &#160; Fire &#38; Security sales 3,570 &#160; 5,515 &#160; 4,985 &#160; Total segment sales 20,861 &#160; 21,032 &#160; 17,796 &#160; Eliminations and other ( 440 ) ( 419 ) ( 340 ) Consolidated $ 20,421 &#160; $ 20,613 &#160; $ 17,456 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects the Company&#8217;s expectations about the consideration it will be entitled to receive from a customer. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount and when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In addition, the Company customarily offers its customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of its products in \n\ndistribution channels. The principal incentive programs provide reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing for products. The Company accounts for estimated incentive payments as a reduction in sales at the time a sale is recognized. \n\nContract Balances \n\nTotal contract assets and liabilities consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Contract assets, current $ 537 &#160; $ 503 &#160; \n\nContract assets, non-current (included within Other assets ) \n\n6 &#160; 70 &#160; Total contract assets 543 &#160; 573 &#160; Contract liabilities, current ( 449 ) ( 415 ) \n\nContract liabilities, non-current (included within Other long-term liabilities ) \n\n( 174 ) ( 165 ) Total contract liabilities ( 623 ) ( 580 ) Net contract assets (liabilities) $ ( 80 ) $ ( 7 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in contract assets and contract liabilities. Contract assets relate to the conditional right to consideration for any completed performance under a contract when costs are incurred in excess of billings under the percentage-of-completion methodology. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of performance under a contract or when the Company has a right to consideration that is conditioned upon transfer of a good or service to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as (or when) the Company performs under the contract. \n\nThe Company recognized revenue of $ 321 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 that was related to contract liabilities as of January 1, 2022. The Company expects a majority of its contract liabilities at the end of the period to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. There were no individually significant customers with sales exceeding 10% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\nNOTE 14: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , which requires a fair-value based method for measuring the value of stock-based compensation. Fair value is measured at the date of grant and is generally not adjusted for subsequent changes. The Company's stock-based compensation plans include programs for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance share units. \n\nStock Options and Appreciation Rights \n\nEligible participants may receive stock options or stock appreciation rights as part of the Company's long-term incentive program. The fair value of each instrument is determined as of the date of grant using a binomial lattice model and expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period. However, in the event of retirement, awards held for at least one year may vest and become exercisable (if applicable), subject to certain terms and conditions. \n\nThe following table summarizes fair value information for stock options and stock appreciation rights: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 (1) \n\n2021 (1) \n\n2020 (1) \n\nStock options and stock appreciation rights weighted-average fair value per award $ 10.68 &#160; $ 10.13 &#160; $ 4.67 &#160; Assumptions: Volatility 30.8 % to 31.3 % \n\n31.6 % to 34.1 % \n\n32.1 % to 35.6 % \n\nExpected term (in years) 6.1 \n\n6.6 \n\n7.0 \n\nExpected dividend yield 1.5 % \n\n1.5 % \n\n1.4 % to 2.0 % \n\nRange of risk-free rates 1.7 % to 3.0 % \n\n0.7 % to 1.4 % \n\n0.1 % to 1.0 % \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Carrier has limited historical trading data and used peer group data to estimate expected volatility for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 awards. \n\nThe Company used historical employee data, including data prior to the Separation and the Distribution, to estimate expected term. The expected dividend yield is consistent with management's expectations. The risk-free rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time the awards were granted. \n\nChanges in stock options and stock appreciation rights outstanding subsequent to the Separation and Distribution were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Shares Subject to Option (in thousands) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Weighted- Average Remaining Life (in years) As of April 3, 2020 36,015 &#160; $ 19.90 &#160; Granted 3,921 &#160; $ 17.57 &#160; Exercised ( 2,620 ) $ 15.81 &#160; Cancelled ( 584 ) $ 22.31 &#160; As of December 31, 2020 36,732 &#160; $ 19.91 &#160; Granted 3,194 &#160; $ 38.92 &#160; Exercised ( 5,934 ) $ 17.59 &#160; Cancelled ( 1,551 ) $ 23.98 &#160; As of December 31, 2021 32,441 &#160; $ 22.02 &#160; Granted 2,715 &#160; $ 47.72 &#160; Exercised ( 3,495 ) $ 17.76 &#160; Cancelled ( 883 ) $ 30.33 &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 30,778 &#160; $ 24.53 &#160; $ 532 &#160; 5.9 Exercisable as of December 31, 2022 17,642 &#160; $ 20.03 &#160; $ 375 &#160; 4.5 ##TABLE_END\n\nRestricted Stock Units \n\nEligible participants may receive restricted stock units (\"RSU\") as part of the Company's long-term incentive program. The fair value of restricted stock units are based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period (which is generally a three-year vesting period). However, in the event of retirement, awards held for at least one year may vest and become exercisable (if applicable), subject to certain terms and conditions. Dividends accrue during the vesting period and are paid in shares of the Company's common stock. \n\nChanges in restricted stock units subsequent to the Separation and Distribution were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START RSUs \n\n(in thousands) \n\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding and unvested as of April 3, 2020 5,622 &#160; $ 21.37 &#160; Granted 523 &#160; $ 21.43 &#160; Vested ( 483 ) $ 19.74 &#160; Cancelled ( 88 ) $ 23.29 &#160; Outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2020 5,574 &#160; $ 21.57 &#160; Granted 286 &#160; $ 46.49 &#160; Vested ( 2,168 ) $ 21.45 &#160; Cancelled ( 122 ) $ 25.39 &#160; Outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2021 3,570 &#160; $ 23.33 &#160; Granted 555 &#160; $ 41.88 &#160; Vested ( 1,915 ) $ 20.85 &#160; Cancelled ( 143 ) $ 32.92 &#160; Outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2022 2,067 &#160; $ 29.87 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nPerformance Share Units \n\nThe Company has a performance share program for key employees whereby awards are provided in the form of performance share units (\"PSU\") based on performance against pre-established objectives. The annual target level is expressed as shares of the Company's common stock based on the fair value of its stock on the date of grant. Awards are earned over a three-year performance period based equally on a performance condition, measured by the compound annual growth rate of the Company's earnings per share and on a market condition, measured by the Company's relative total shareowner return compared to the total shareowner return of a subset of industrial companies in the S&#38;P 500 Index. The fair value of the market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The fair value of the PSU awards are expensed over the required service period, which is generally a three-year vesting period. In the event of retirement, performance share units held for at least one year remain eligible to vest based on actual performance relative to pre-established metrics. Dividends do not accrue on the performance share units during the performance period. \n\nChanges in PSUs subsequent to the Separation and Distribution were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START PSUs \n\n(in thousands) \n\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding and unvested as of April 3, 2020 68 &#160; $ 21.23 &#160; Granted 728 &#160; $ 18.23 &#160; Forfeited ( 24 ) $ 19.25 &#160; Outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2020 772 &#160; $ 18.46 &#160; Granted 821 &#160; $ 41.48 &#160; Vested ( 20 ) $ 23.72 &#160; Forfeited ( 152 ) $ 27.28 &#160; Outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2021 1,421 &#160; $ 30.75 &#160; Granted 653 &#160; $ 46.93 &#160; Vested ( 5 ) $ 41.81 &#160; Forfeited ( 139 ) $ 35.45 &#160; Outstanding and unvested as of December 31, 2022 1,930 &#160; $ 35.86 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nCompensation Expense \n\nStock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is included in Cost of products sold , Selling, general and administrative and Research and development, in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nStock-based compensation cost by award type are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 (1) \n\nEquity compensation costs - equity settled $ 77 &#160; $ 92 &#160; $ 77 &#160; \n\nEquity compensation costs - cash settled (2) \n\n( 15 ) 19 &#160; 11 &#160; Total stock-based compensation cost $ 62 &#160; $ 111 &#160; $ 88 &#160; Income tax benefit $ 9 &#160; $ 13 &#160; $ 9 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) The stock-based compensation cost for 2020 include amounts allocated to Carrier by UTC related to its direct employees. \n\n(2) The cash settled awards are classified as liability awards and are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. \n\nPrior to the Separation and the Distribution, the Company participated in UTC&#8217;s long-term incentive plans, which authorized various types of market and performance-based incentive awards. Stock-based compensation expense was allocated to the Company from UTC based upon direct employee headcount. In connection with the Separation and the Distribution, all awards were converted to Carrier stock-based awards with unvested awards converted to preserve the aggregate intrinsic value immediately before and after the Separation. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $ 64 million and $ 77 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to non-vested awards granted under the plan, respectively, which will be recognized ratably over the awards weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2 years. \n\nNOTE 15: RESTRUCTURING COSTS \n\nThe Company incurs costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to improve operating performance, profitability and working capital levels. Actions associated with these initiatives may include improving productivity, workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities. Due to the size, nature and frequency of these discrete plans, they are fundamentally different from the Company&#8217;s ongoing productivity initiatives. \n\nThe Company recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs for new and ongoing restructuring actions as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 HVAC $ 8 &#160; $ 33 &#160; $ 7 &#160; Refrigeration 10 &#160; 25 &#160; 12 &#160; Fire &#38; Security 11 &#160; 26 &#160; 28 &#160; Total Segment 29 &#160; 84 &#160; 47 &#160; General corporate expenses 2 &#160; 5 &#160; 2 &#160; Total restructuring costs $ 31 &#160; $ 89 &#160; $ 49 &#160; Cost of sales $ 9 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 20 &#160; Selling, general and administrative 22 &#160; 60 &#160; 29 &#160; Other income (expense), net &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Total restructuring costs $ 31 &#160; $ 89 &#160; $ 49 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe following table summarizes the reserves and charges related to the restructuring reserve, included in Accrued liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Balance as of January 1, $ 54 &#160; $ 49 &#160; Net pre-tax restructuring costs 31 &#160; 89 &#160; Utilization, foreign exchange and other ( 61 ) ( 76 ) Reclassified as Liabilities held for sale (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 8 ) Balance as of December 31, $ 24 &#160; $ 54 &#160; ##TABLE_END (1) See Note 20 - Divestitures for additional information. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, charges associated with restructuring initiatives related to cost reduction efforts. Amounts recognized primarily related to severance due to workforce reductions and exit costs due to the consolidation of field operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 24 million accrued for costs associated with its announced restructuring initiatives, all of which is expected to be paid within one year. \n\nNOTE 16: OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET \n\nOther income (expense), net consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 \n\nTransaction gains (1) \n\n$ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,123 &#160; \n\nImpairment charge on minority-owned joint venture investments (1) \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) ( 72 ) Other 1,840 &#160; 41 &#160; ( 45 ) Other income (expense), net $ 1,840 &#160; $ 39 &#160; $ 1,006 &#160; ##TABLE_END (1) See Note 22 - Related Parties for additional information. \n\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the impact of gains and losses related to the sale of interests in equity method investments, foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency and hedging-related activities. In connection with the TCC acquisition, the carrying value of the Company's previously held TCC equity investments were recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. As a result, the Company recognized a $ 705 million non-cash gain associated with the increase in our ownership interest. In addition, the Company completed the Chubb Sale and recognized a net gain on the sale of $ 1.1 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. \n\nNOTE 17: INCOME TAXES \n\nIncome Before Income Taxes \n\nThe sources of Income from operations before income taxes are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 1,876 &#160; $ 1,528 &#160; $ 915 &#160; Foreign 2,416 &#160; 872 &#160; 1,940 &#160; Total $ 4,292 &#160; $ 2,400 &#160; $ 2,855 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nThe income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following components: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current: United States: Federal $ 453 &#160; $ 336 &#160; $ 434 &#160; State 120 &#160; 83 &#160; 74 &#160; Foreign 259 &#160; 354 &#160; 244 &#160; 832 &#160; 773 &#160; 752 &#160; Future: United States: Federal ( 23 ) ( 125 ) 13 &#160; State ( 29 ) ( 14 ) 6 &#160; Foreign ( 72 ) 65 &#160; 78 &#160; ( 124 ) ( 74 ) 97 &#160; Income tax expense $ 708 &#160; $ 699 &#160; $ 849 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate \n\nThe differences between the effective income tax rate and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START 2022 2021 2020 Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % 21.0 &#160; % State income tax 1.5 &#160; 1.9 &#160; 1.7 &#160; Tax on international activities ( 1.0 ) 7.2 &#160; 4.2 &#160; Separation impact &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3.4 &#160; TCC acquisition impact ( 4.2 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Other ( 0.8 ) ( 1.0 ) ( 0.6 ) Effective income tax rate 16.5 &#160; % 29.1 &#160; % 29.7 &#160; % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the Company's statutory U.S. federal income tax rate. The decrease was driven by a lower effective tax rate on the $ 705 million non-cash gain resulting from the recognition of the Company's previously held TCC equity investments at fair value upon acquisition of TCC, a lower effective tax rate on the $ 1.1 billion Chubb gain and $ 45 million of foreign tax credits generated and utilized in the current year. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was higher than the Company's statutory U.S. federal income tax rate. The increase was driven by a net tax charge of $ 157 million primarily relating to the re-organization and disentanglement of certain Chubb subsidiaries executed in advance of the planned divestiture of the Chubb business and a $ 43 million deferred tax charge associated with a tax rate increase in the United Kingdom enacted on June 10, 2021 with an effective date of April 2023. These amounts were partially offset by the recognition of a favorable tax adjustment of $ 70 million due to foreign tax credits generated and expected to be utilized in the current year and $ 21 million resulting from the re-organization of a German subsidiary. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than the Company's statutory U.S. federal income tax rate. The increase was driven by a $ 51 million charge related to a valuation allowance recorded against a United Kingdom tax loss and credit carryforward and a charge of $ 46 million resulting from the Company's decision to no longer permanently reinvest certain pre-2018 unremitted non-U.S. earnings. These items were impacted by the Separation and included in \"Separation impact\" in the previous table. \n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities \n\nFuture income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions, which are reported in different periods for tax and GAAP purposes. These amounts consist of the tax effects of differences between tax and GAAP that are expected to be reversed in the \n\nfuture and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax paying component of a particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Future income tax benefits: Insurance and employee benefits $ 161 &#160; $ 198 &#160; Other assets basis differences 284 &#160; 166 &#160; Other liabilities basis differences 571 &#160; 512 &#160; Tax loss carryforward 177 &#160; 175 &#160; Tax credit carryforward 29 &#160; 24 &#160; Valuation allowances ( 100 ) ( 90 ) Future income tax benefit $ 1,122 &#160; $ 985 &#160; Future income tax payables: Goodwill and intangible assets $ ( 449 ) $ ( 270 ) Other asset basis differences ( 395 ) ( 307 ) Future income tax payables $ ( 844 ) $ ( 577 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nValuation allowances have been established primarily for tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and certain foreign temporary differences to reduce future income tax benefits to expected realizable amounts. As of December 31, 2021, future income tax benefits and future income tax payables exclude a net liability of $ 266 million classified as held for sale. See Note 20 - Divestitures for additional information. \n\nChanges to valuation allowances consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Balance as of January 1, 2020 $ 128 &#160; Additions charged to income tax expense (1) \n\n112 &#160; Reduction credited to income tax expense ( 13 ) Other adjustments 4 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 231 &#160; Additions charged to income tax expense 32 &#160; Reduction credited to income tax expense ( 22 ) Other adjustments ( 41 ) Reclassified to held for sale ( 110 ) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 90 &#160; Additions charged to income tax expense 18 &#160; Reduction credited to income tax expense ( 22 ) Other adjustments 14 &#160; Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 100 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes $ 89 million relating to \"Separation impact\" discussed in section \"Reconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate.\" \n\nTax Credit and Loss Carryforwards \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, tax credit carryforwards and tax loss carryforwards were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Tax Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards Expiration period: 2023-2027 $ 107 &#160; $ 7 &#160; 2028-2032 61 &#160; 5 &#160; 2033-2042 33 &#160; 4 &#160; Indefinite 607 &#160; 13 &#160; Total $ 808 &#160; $ 29 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasts of taxable income. The Company considers all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. The Company maintains valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets. \n\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $ 291 million, all of which, if recognized, would impact its effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expense is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of period $ 251 &#160; $ 162 &#160; $ 166 &#160; Additions for tax positions related to the current year 34 &#160; 86 &#160; 22 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years (1) \n\n32 &#160; 24 &#160; 14 &#160; Reductions for tax positions of prior years (2) \n\n( 13 ) ( 1 ) ( 40 ) Settlements ( 13 ) ( 18 ) &#8212; &#160; Reclassified as held for sale \n\n&#8212; &#160; ( 2 ) &#8212; &#160; Balance at end of period $ 291 &#160; $ 251 &#160; $ 162 &#160; Gross interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits $ 16 &#160; $ 8 &#160; $ 6 &#160; Total accrued interest balance at end of period $ 48 &#160; $ 35 &#160; $ 25 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Includes $ 14 million related to acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n(2) Includes an adjustment of $ 37 million recorded in UTC Net investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 for tax positions of prior years. \n\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, the Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, the Company's operations were included in UTC's combined tax returns for the periods through the Separation and the Distribution. The IRS commenced an audit of UTC's tax years 2017 and 2018 in the second quarter of 2020 and this audit will continue into 2023. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including the U.S., Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for years prior to 2017 and, with few exceptions, is no longer subject to U.S. state and local and foreign income tax examinations for tax years before 2013. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company's income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management&#8217;s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $ 45 million to $ 55 million may occur within 12 months as a result of additional uncertain tax positions, the revaluation of uncertain tax positions arising from examinations, appeals, court decisions or the closure of tax statutes. \n\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), the Company no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. As such, the Company has recorded the taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings. For the remainder of the Company's undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, the Company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. As of December 31, 2022, such undistributed earnings were approximately $ 10 billion, excluding other comprehensive income amounts. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the remaining amounts. In addition, the TCJA subjects the Company to a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). GILTI is a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations which the Company has elected to account for as a period cost. \n\nNOTE 18: EARNINGS PER SHARE \n\nEarnings per share is computed by dividing Net income attributable to common shareowners by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock). Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive stock awards that are outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the effect of the potential exercise would be anti-dilutive. \n\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net income attributable to common shareowners $ 3,534 &#160; $ 1,664 &#160; $ 1,982 &#160; Basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding 843.4 &#160; 867.7 &#160; 866.5 &#160; Stock awards and equity units (share equivalent) 17.8 &#160; 22.6 &#160; 13.7 &#160; Diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding 861.2 &#160; 890.3 &#160; 880.2 &#160; Antidilutive shares excluded from computation of diluted earnings per share 2.9 &#160; 0.1 &#160; (1) 0.2 &#160; Earnings Per Share Basic $ 4.19 &#160; $ 1.92 &#160; $ 2.29 &#160; Diluted $ 4.10 &#160; $ 1.87 &#160; $ 2.25 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 19: ACQUISITIONS \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired consolidated and minority-owned businesses. The aggregate cash paid, net of cash acquired, totaled $ 506 million. Acquisitions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. As a result, the aggregate purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimate of fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and totaled $ 905 million. \n\nToshiba Carrier Corporation \n\nOn February 6, 2022, the Company entered into a binding agreement to acquire a majority ownership interest in TCC for $ 930 million. TCC, a VRF and light commercial HVAC joint venture between Carrier and Toshiba Corporation, designs and manufactures flexible, energy-efficient and high-performance VRF and light commercial HVAC systems as well as commercial products, compressors and heat pumps. The acquisition included all of TCC&#8217;s advanced research and development centers and global manufacturing operations, product pipeline and the long-term use of Toshiba&#8217;s iconic brand. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2022 and funded through the Japanese Term Loan Facility and cash on hand. Upon closing, Toshiba Corporation retained a 5 % ownership interest in TCC. \n\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) August 1, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 462 &#160; Accounts receivable 414 &#160; Inventories 373 &#160; Other assets, current 54 &#160; Fixed assets 343 &#160; Intangible assets 965 &#160; Goodwill 889 &#160; Other assets 293 &#160; Accounts payable ( 412 ) Accrued liabilities ( 445 ) Contract liabilities, current ( 21 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 565 ) Net assets acquired $ 2,350 &#160; Less: Fair value of non-controlling interests ( 22 ) Less: Fair value of previously held TCC equity investments ( 1,398 ) Total cash consideration $ 930 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and totaled $ 889 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes. Accounts receivable and current liabilities were stated at their historical carrying value, which approximates fair value given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The estimate of fair value for inventory and fixed assets was based on an assessment of the acquired assets' condition as well as an evaluation of the current market value of such assets. The sale agreement included several customary provisions to settle working capital and other transaction-related items as of the date of sale. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the parties finalized these amounts in accordance with the terms of the sale agreement. As a result, the Company recorded an accrual of $ 39 million which is expected to be paid to Toshiba Corporation in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nThe Company recorded intangible assets based on its estimate of fair value which consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Estimated Useful Life (in years) Intangible Assets Acquired Customer relationships 23 $ 497 &#160; Technology 7 220 &#160; Trademark 26 180 &#160; Backlog 1 60 &#160; Land use rights 45 8 &#160; Total intangible assets acquired $ 965 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe valuation of intangible assets was determined using an income approach methodology including the multi-period excess earnings method and the relief from royalty method. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth rates, EBIT margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates and royalty rates among others. The projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. As of December 31, 2022, the Company finalized the process of allocating the purchase price and valuing the acquired assets and liabilities except for certain amounts associated with pension funding levels and income taxes. \n\nThe Company previously accounted for its minority ownership in TCC under the equity method of accounting. In connection with the transaction, the carrying value of the Company's previously held TCC equity investments were recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition using an income approach methodology. As a result, the Company recognized a $ 705 million non-cash \n\ngain within Other income (expense), net on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of TCC are consolidated in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements as of the date of acquisition and reported within the Company's HVAC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $ 29 million of acquisition-related costs which are included within Selling, general and administrative on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company has not included pro forma financial information required under ASC 805 as the pro forma impact was not deemed significant. \n\nAcquisition of Guangdong Giwee Group Co. \n\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company acquired a 70 % controlling stake in Guangdong Giwee Group Co. and its subsidiaries (\"Giwee\") and subsequently acquired the remaining 30 % ownership in Giwee on September 7, 2021. Giwee is a China-based manufacturer offering a portfolio of HVAC products including variable refrigerant flow, modular chillers and light commercial air conditioners. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand. \n\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and totaled $ 182 million, which is no t deductible for tax purposes. Accounts receivable and current liabilities were stated at their historical carrying value, which approximates fair value given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The estimate of fair value for inventory and property, plant and equipment was based on an assessment of the acquired assets' condition as well as an evaluation of the current market value of such assets. \n\nThe Company recorded intangible assets which consisted of the following: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) Estimated Useful Life (in years) Intangible Assets Acquired \n\nCustomer relationships \n\n14 $ 52 &#160; Technology 10 34 &#160; \n\nNon-compete agreement \n\n5 8 &#160; Total intangible assets acquired $ 94 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe valuation of intangible assets was determined using an income approach methodology including the multi-period excess earnings method and the relief from royalty method. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and royalty rates. The projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. \n\nThe results of Giwee are reported within the HVAC segment as of the date of acquisition. The Company finalized the process of allocating the purchase price and valuing the acquired assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has not included pro forma financial information required under ASC 805 as the pro forma impact was not deemed significant. \n\nNOTE 20: DIVESTITURES \n\nOn January 3, 2022, the Company completed the Chubb Sale for net proceeds of $ 2.9 billion. Chubb, which was reported within the Company&#8217;s Fire &#38; Security segment, delivered essential fire safety and security solutions from design and installation to monitoring, service and maintenance across more than 17 countries around the globe. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a net gain on the sale of $ 1.1 billion, which is included in Other income (expense), net on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nThe following table summarizes Chubb's assets and liabilities classified as held for sale: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 60 &#160; Accounts receivable, net 445 &#160; Inventories, net 73 &#160; Contract assets, current 184 &#160; Other assets, current 27 &#160; Fixed assets, net 67 &#160; Intangible assets, net 545 &#160; Goodwill 940 &#160; Operating lease right-of-use assets 193 &#160; Pension and post-retirement assets 614 &#160; Other assets 20 &#160; Total assets held for sale $ 3,168 &#160; Accounts payable $ ( 190 ) Accrued liabilities ( 248 ) Contract liabilities, current ( 162 ) Future pension and post-retirement obligations ( 69 ) Future income tax obligations ( 273 ) Operating lease liabilities ( 175 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 17 ) Total liabilities held for sale $ ( 1,134 ) ##TABLE_END\n\nThe sale agreement included several customary provisions to settle working capital and other transaction-related items as of the date of sale.

With the exception of the U.S. as presented in the following table, there were no individually significant countries with sales exceeding 10% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. \n\n##TABLE_START External Sales Long-Lived Assets (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 United States Operations $ 11,797 &#160; $ 10,492 &#160; $ 9,105 &#160; $ 803 &#160; $ 772 &#160; International Operations Europe 4,359 &#160; 5,776 &#160; 4,935 &#160; 453 &#160; 476 &#160; Asia Pacific 3,489 &#160; 3,464 &#160; 2,655 &#160; 573 &#160; 279 &#160; Other 776 &#160; 881 &#160; 761 &#160; 412 &#160; 299 &#160; Consolidated $ 20,421 &#160; $ 20,613 &#160; $ 17,456 &#160; $ 2,241 &#160; $ 1,826 &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\nNOTE 22: RELATED PARTIES \n\nEquity Method Investments \n\nThe Company sells products to and purchases products from unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method and, therefore, these entities are considered to be related parties. The Company has 27 directly owned unconsolidated domestic and foreign affiliates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which 99 % of such investments are in its HVAC segment. Amounts attributable to equity method investees are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 \n\nSales to equity method investees included in Product sales \n\n$ 2,845 &#160; $ 2,258 &#160; $ 1,758 &#160; \n\nPurchases from equity method investees included in Cost of products sold \n\n$ 331 &#160; $ 357 &#160; $ 292 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company had receivables from and payables to equity method investees as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\nReceivables from equity method investees included in Accounts receivable, net \n\n$ 154 &#160; $ 150 &#160; \n\nPayables to equity method investees included in Accounts payable \n\n$ 44 &#160; $ 51 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe financial results of TCC are included in the Company's consolidated results since the acquisition date of August 1, 2022. Prior to the acquisition, the Company previously accounted for its minority ownership in TCC under the equity method of accounting. As a result, prior period results may not be comparable to the current period. \n\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its equity method investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. In 2020, the Company determined that indicators of impairment existed for a minority owned joint venture investment and performed a valuation of this investment using a discounted cash flow method. The Company determined that the loss in value was other-than-temporary due to a reduction in sales and earnings that were primarily driven by a deterioration in the oil and gas industry (the joint venture's primary market) and by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash, other-than-temporary impairment charge of $ 71 million on this investment in 2020, which is included in Other income (expense), net on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n\nIn September 2020, the Company sold 9.25 million B shares of Beijer for SEK 290 ($ 32.38 ) per share equal to approximately 7.9 % of the outstanding B shares in Beijer, through an accelerated equity offering. The Company received proceeds of approximately $ 300 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $ 252 million, which is included in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Subsequently, in December 2020, the Company sold all of its remaining A and B shares of Beijer for SEK 245 ($ 29.03 ) per share. The Company received proceeds of approximately $ 1.1 billion and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $ 871 million, which is included in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to the sale of the Company's remaining shares, Beijer was reported as an equity method investment. \n\nSummarized Financial Information . Pursuant to Rule 3-10 and Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the Company presents summarized financial information of the combined accounts of its non-consolidated joint ventures accounted for by the equity method. \n\nSummarized unaudited financial information for equity method investments is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 Current assets $ 10,621 &#160; $ 4,275 &#160; Non-current assets 1,931 &#160; 2,140 &#160; Total assets 12,552 &#160; 6,415 &#160; Current liabilities ( 8,631 ) ( 2,596 ) Non-current liabilities ( 195 ) ( 329 ) Total liabilities ( 8,826 ) ( 2,925 ) Total net equity of investees $ 3,726 &#160; $ 3,490 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales $ 11,524 &#160; $ 9,471 &#160; $ 9,299 &#160; Gross profit $ 2,274 &#160; $ 1,907 &#160; $ 1,722 &#160; Income from continuing operations $ 757 &#160; $ 650 &#160; $ 544 &#160; Net income $ 757 &#160; $ 650 &#160; $ 544 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNOTE 23: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \n\nThe Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental (including asbestos) and legal matters. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies , the Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are generally based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the Company accrues the minimum amount. In addition, these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of the following matters based on the information currently available, except as otherwise noted. However, the Company does not believe that the resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are subject to environmental regulation by various authorities. The Company has accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to, investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to individual sites, including the technology required to remediate, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding liability for environmental obligations are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\nEnvironmental reserves included in Accrued liabilities \n\n$ 24 &#160; $ 29 &#160; \n\nEnvironmental reserves included in Other long-term liabilities \n\n211 &#160; 191 Total environmental reserves $ 235 &#160; $ 220 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nFor sites with multiple responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for these costs. Accrued environmental liabilities are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursements and are undiscounted. \n\nAsbestos Matters \n\nThe Company has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos allegedly integrated into certain Carrier products or business premises. While the Company has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it into any currently-manufactured products, certain products that the Company no longer manufactures contained components incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been dismissed without payment or have been covered in full or in part by insurance or other forms of indemnity. Additional cases were litigated and settled without any insurance reimbursement. The amounts involved in asbestos-related claims were not material individually or in the aggregate in any period. \n\nThe Company's asbestos liabilities and related insurance recoveries are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\nAsbestos liabilities included in Accrued liabilities \n\n$ 16 &#160; $ 17 &#160; \n\nAsbestos liabilities included in Other long-term liabilities \n\n212 &#160; 220 &#160; Total asbestos liabilities $ 228 &#160; $ 237 &#160; \n\nAsbestos-related recoveries included in Other assets, current \n\n$ 5 &#160; $ 5 &#160; \n\nAsbestos-related recoveries included in Other assets \n\n90 &#160; 93 &#160; Total asbestos-related recoveries $ 95 &#160; $ 98 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities are based on currently available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable and are made with input from outside actuarial experts. These amounts are undiscounted and exclude the Company's legal fees to defend the asbestos claims, which are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company has recorded insurance recovery receivables for probable asbestos-related recoveries. \n\nUTC Equity Awards Conversion Litigation \n\nOn August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint (the \"Complaint\") in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against Raytheon Technologies Corporation, Carrier, Otis, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors ( Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al .). The Complaint challenged the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to UTC, Carrier and Otis equity awards following the Separation and the Distribution. Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. Plaintiffs amended their Complaint on September 13, 2021 (the \"Amended Complaint\"). The Amended Complaint, with Raytheon, Carrier and Otis as the only defendants, asserted that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Amended Complaint also sought specific performance. Carrier believes all plaintiffs' claims against the Company are without merit. Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On September 30, 2022, the court dismissed the case against all defendants, with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The briefing process is ongoing. \n\nAqueous Film Forming Foam Litigation \n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Kidde-Fenwal, Inc. (\"KFI\"), have been named as defendants in more than 3,150 lawsuits filed by individuals in or removed to the federal courts of the United States alleging that the historic use of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (\"AFFF\") caused personal injuries and/or property damage. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including KFI, have also been named as a defendant in more than 300 lawsuits filed by several U.S. states, municipalities and water utilities in or removed to U.S. federal courts alleging that the historic use of AFFF caused contamination of property and water supplies. In December 2018, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred and consolidated all AFFF cases pending in the U.S. federal courts against the Company and others to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina (\"MDL Court\") for pre-trial proceedings (\"MDL Proceedings\"). The individual \n\nplaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings generally seek damages for alleged personal injuries, medical monitoring, diminution in property value and injunctive relief to remediate alleged contamination of water supplies. The U.S. state, municipal and water utility plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings generally seek damages and costs related to the remediation of public property and water supplies. \n\nAFFF is a firefighting foam, developed beginning in the late 1960s pursuant to U.S. military specification, used to extinguish certain types of hydrocarbon-fueled fires primarily at military bases and airports. AFFF was manufactured by several companies, including National Foam and Angus Fire. UTC subsidiaries first entered the AFFF business with their acquisition of National Foam and Angus Fire in 2005 as part of the acquisition of KFI and Kidde Products Limited (\"KPL\"). In 2013, KFI and KPL divested the National Foam and Angus Fire businesses to a third party. The Company acquired KFI and KPL as part of its separation from UTC in April 2020. During the eight-year period of its operation by KFI, National Foam manufactured AFFF for sale to government (including the U.S. federal government) and non-government customers in the U.S. at a single facility located in West Chester, Pennsylvania (\"Pennsylvania Site\"). During the same period, Angus Fire manufactured AFFF for sale outside the United States at a single facility located in Bentham, England. \n\nThe key components of AFFF that contribute to its fire-extinguishing capabilities are known as fluorosurfactants. Niether the Company nor any of its former or current subsidiaries, including National Foam/Angus Fire and KFI/KPL, respectively, manufactured fluorosurfactants; they instead purchased these substances from unrelated third parties to in turn manufacture AFFF. Plaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings allege that the fluorosurfactants used by various manufacturers in producing AFFF contained, or over time degraded into, compounds known as perflourooctane sulfonate (\"PFOS\") and/or perflourooctane acid (\"PFOA\"). Plaintiffs further allege that, as a result of the use of AFFF, PFOS and PFOA were released into the environment and, in some instances, ultimately reached drinking water supplies. \n\nPlaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings allege that PFOS and PFOA contamination has resulted from the use of AFFF manufactured using a process known as ECF, and that this process was used exclusively by 3M. They also allege that PFOA contamination has resulted from the use of AFFF manufactured using a different process, known as telomerization, and that this process was used exclusively by the other AFFF manufacturers (including National Foam and Angus Fire). Compounds containing PFOS and PFOA (as well as many other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known collectively as \"PFAS\") have also been used for decades by many third parties in a number of different industries to manufacture firefighters&#8217; protective outerwear, carpets, clothing, fabrics, cookware, food packaging, personal care products, cleaning products, paints, varnishes and other consumer and industrial products. \n\nPlaintiffs in the MDL Proceedings have named multiple defendants, including four suppliers of chemicals and raw materials used to manufacture fluorosurfactants, four fluorosurfactant manufacturers, two toll manufacturers of fluorosurfactants and seven current (including National Foam and Angus Fire) and former (including the Company and KFI) AFFF manufacturers. \n\nThe defendants moved for summary judgment on the government contractor defense, which potentially applies to AFFF sold to or used by the U.S. government. After full briefing and oral argument, on September 16, 2022, the MDL court declined to enter summary judgment for the defendants. The defense, however, remains available at any trial to which it applies. \n\nOn September 23, 2022, after completion of discovery, the MDL court selected one water provider case, the City of Stuart, FL v. 3M, et al., for a bellwether trial. That trial is tentatively scheduled for June 2023. The MDL court has ordered that the bellwether process for personal injury cases will begin in 2023. The court has not yet outlined details on that process or its timing. \n\nOutside of the MDL Proceedings, the Company and other defendants are also party to six lawsuits in U.S. state courts brought by oil refining companies alleging product liability claims related to legacy sales of AFFF and seeking damages for the costs to replace the product and for property damage. In addition, the Company and other defendants are party to two actions related to the Pennsylvania Site in which the plaintiff water utility company seeks remediation costs related to the alleged contamination of the local water supply. \n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, and other defendants are also party to one action in Arizona state court brought by a firefighter claiming that occupational exposure to AFFF has caused him certain personal injuries. The Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims in the MDL Proceedings and the other AFFF lawsuits. Based on its 2013 agreement for the sale of National Foam and Angus Fire, the Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, are pursuing indemnification against these claims from the purchaser and current owner of National Foam and Angus Fire. The Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, are also pursuing insurance coverage for these claims. \n\nAt this time, however, given the numerous factual, scientific and legal issues to be resolved relating to these claims, the Company is unable to assess the probability of liability or to reasonably estimate the damages, if any, to be allocated to the Company and its subsidiaries, including KFI, if one or more plaintiffs were to prevail in these cases. There can be no assurance that any such future exposure will not be material in any period. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement relating to the Separation, the Company is responsible to UTC for its share of the TCJA transition tax associated with foreign undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2017. As a result, liabilities of $ 34 million and $ 383 million are included within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accrued Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31, 2022, respectively. This obligation is expected to be settled in annual installments ending in April 2026 with the next installment of $ 34 million due in 2023. The Company believes that the likelihood of incurring losses materially in excess of this amount is remote. \n\nSelf-Insurance \n\nThe Company maintains self-insurance for a number of risks, including but not limited to, workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property and employee-related healthcare benefits. It has obtained insurance coverage for amounts exceeding individual and aggregate loss limits. The Company accrues for known future claims and incurred but not reported losses. \n\nThe Company's self-insurance liabilities were as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 \n\nSelf-insurance liabilities included in Accrued liabilities \n\n$ 139 &#160; $ 154 &#160; \n\nSelf-insurance liabilities included in Other long-term liabilities \n\n53 &#160; 72 Total self-insurance liabilities $ 192 &#160; $ 226 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company incurred expenses related to self-insured risks of $ 155 million, $ 155 million and $ 145 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\nOther Matters \n\nThe Company has other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for contingencies generally based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the Company accrues the minimum amount. \n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is also routinely a defendant in, party to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some of these proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. The Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon its competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \n\nNOTE 24: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION \n\nSupplemental cash flow information was as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest paid, net of amounts capitalized $ 297 &#160; $ 317 &#160; $ 196 &#160; Income taxes paid, net of refunds $ 833 &#160; $ 675 &#160; $ 819 &#160; Non-cash financing activity: Common stock dividends payable $ 158 &#160; $ 130 &#160; $ 108 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n"

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES \n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures &#8212; Our management, with the participation of our CEO and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022 . Based on that evaluation, the Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022 , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, and that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. \n\nManagement&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting &#8212; The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company&#8217;s management, with the participation of the Company&#8217;s CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company&#8217;s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022 , the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting was effective. \n\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. As discussed in Note 19 \"Acquisitions\" of the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company acquired a majority ownership interest in TCC on August 1, 2022 in a purchase business combination. TCC has total assets excluding intangible assets and goodwill arising from the acquisition and total net sales, of approximately 7% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 excluded the TCC acquisition, as the Company is in the process of aligning and integrating various processes, systems and internal controls related to the business and operations of this subsidiary, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, which are included within the scope of management&#8217;s assessment. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 as stated in their report which appears herein. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting &#8212; There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n"

Under the 2020 LTIP, each SAR referred to in clause (ii) is exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock having a value equal to the increase in the market price of a share of such stock from the date the SAR was granted. For purposes of determining the total number of shares to be issued in respect of outstanding SARs as reflected in column (a) above, we have used the NYSE closing price for a share of Common Stock on December 31, 2022 of $41.25. The \n\nweighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights shown in column (b) takes into account only the shares identified in clauses (i) and (ii). \n\n(2) Represents the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available to be awarded under the 2020 LTIP as of December 31, 2022. Performance share units and restricted stock units (Full Share Awards) will result in a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the 2020 LTIP in an amount equal to 2 times the number of shares to which the award corresponds. Stock options and stock appreciation rights do not constitute Full Share Awards and will result in a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the 2020 LTIP on a one-for-one basis. \n\n"
